been a commonplace). The ventilation of pits was improved. Their
safety was enhanced by developments such as the introduction of the
Davy safety-lamp (again a result of Orban's initiative at Plomterie)
in 1817. Joseph Chaudron with his cuvelage en fer found a
better way of strengthening mining shafts with a revetment of iron.
The production of coal grew rapidly. By the decade 1831-40 it was
averaging 2,917,000 tons per annum; in the following decade the
annual output was 4,815,000 tons.
   <p>A small group of able and determined men was rapidly transforming
the economy of the country &mdash; the Orbans, the Bauwens, the Hudsons, the
Leli&egrave;vres; but above all the Cockerill dynasty, whose history, as
an epitome of Belgian industrial growth during the first half of the
century is worth sketching.
   <p>Continental industrial advance in the early decades of the
nineteenth century was largely a matter of absorbing the lessons
afforded by the British example. Frequently it was an Englishman who
taught the lesson. It is ironical that the Englishman whose family
was to do more than any other to give Belgium the lead for many
decades should have been found out of work in the country which was
ultimately to advance further and faster along the road to industrial
achievement than any other Continental state. William Cockerill, the
founder of the line, was discovered by a member of the Verviers firm
of Simonis \et Biolley in Hamburg in 1798. Within two years he was
producing textile machinery. In 1802 his two sons, James and John,
built their own textile machinery factory in Li&egrave;ge. It was
immensely successful, and a decade later in 1812 was producing
spinning and carding machines at a rate of several hundreds a year.
The Cockerill interests expanded rapidly. An important stage was
reached in 1817 when their Seraing iron-works was built: an old
episcopal palace was converted into a machine shop for the
construction of steam-engines. In 1823 James retired from the firm,
making over his share to his remarkable brother. This was a
significant year for John in another direction also since it was then
that he disproved the belief, general at the time, that Belgian coal
would not coke satisfactorily. He supervised the installation of the
first coke-fed blast furnace in Belgium at Seraing. This plant was
capable of a daily output as high as ten tons, or more than most
charcoal furnaces could manage in a week. By 1829 the Li&egrave;ge
district was producing over 7,000 tons of pig-iron a year, chiefly at
Seraing. In 1835 the first continental-built railway locomotive was
constructed there. Two years later Cockerill's enthusiasm for
technical excellence led him to introduce the hot-blast system into
his Seraing plant, at a time when Neilson's invention was less than a
decade old, and still little used in Britain outside Scotland. In
1840 shortly before the death of John Cockerill, his Seraing works
alone employed 2,000 men and were reckoned the largest in Europe
(eight years later Krupp, the colossus of the future, employed only 70
men). This man, described by Schnabel as the first <squote>truly princely
businessman since the days of the Fugger</squote>, travelled constantly to
foster his interests, which extended over most of western Europe north
of the Alps. His range of interest, knowledge and energy were
invaluable to the Belgian metal, engineering and textile industries.
   <p>The new developments of coalfield industry had revolutionized the
scale of production of certain industries and lowered unit costs of
production; but it is easily possible to exaggerate the degree to
which the country outside the coalfields had come under the sway of
the new coal age. Older methods of production were not entirely
replaced even in those industries which were most changed by the new
conditions. This was true, for example, even of the iron industry.
In 1838 sixty-six out of the eighty-nine blast furnaces in the
country were still charcoal fed. It was not until the middle fifties
that the Semois iron industry in the Belgian Ardennes, which was
entirely dependent on charcoal, fell into decline, although its annual
capacity, which never much exceeded 10,000 tons, had for many years
been far outdistanced by Seraing.
   <p>The implications of the new age were to be seen in Belgium not
only in the positive achievements of the age &mdash; the great growth in
coalfield industry and the exciting possibilities of the new and
developing railways; but equally strikingly in a negative sense. In
the 1840s the largest of the traditional industries of Belgium, the
linen industry of Flanders, was in crisis, a fatal one as it proved,
because the Flemish spinsters could not compete with the machine-made
thread of the English mills. Since there were estimated to be 280,000
spinsters in the linen industry in 1840 (often, of course, only partly
dependent on their spinning for a livelihood) the negative side was as
keenly felt and widely recognized as the positive side represented by
the work of the Cockerills and their rivals. There was a whip to goad
as well as a carrot to entice.
   <p>The new pattern of industrial life which was spreading to the
Continent from England affected Belgium a little earlier than other
countries. Within the Austrasian field it was two Belgian areas,
Hainaut and Li&egrave;ge, which were first to use the two key advances of
the new age extensively. The coke-fired blast furnace and the
steam-engine were commonplaces there when they were still rare in Nord
and almost unknown in the Ruhr. It was natural, therefore, that
Belgian men and Belgian money should have taken the lead within the
field even in French and German areas. Capital, technical expertise
and entrepreneurs proved quite footloose within the field in its
formative years, seeking employment always where the expectation of
profit was greatest. Since it is important to the theme of the other
chapters of this first part of the book to show that in such matters
national boundaries were seldom of great consequence in the early
years, it is worthwhile considering the extent of Belgian
participation in the development of areas of the Austrasian field
outside Belgium before considering Nord, Aachen and the Ruhr
separately.
<head>The Belgian Influence in the Nord</head>
   <p>Between Nord and Hainaut there had long been close ties. The
Mons portion of the Hainaut coalfield had been occupied by France
during the War of the Spanish Succession from 1701 to 1709, and during
this short time French capital gained a foothold in the coal industry
of the area which proved long lasting. The industry of Nord became
heavily dependent upon coal drawn from this source during the
eighteenth century, and remained so to a lesser and declining extent
into the nineteenth. It was recognition of the danger of this
dependence combined with the high duties on Belgian coal which
prompted a persistent search for a French source of coal in Nord
itself (when this search culminated in a great success at Anzin in
1734, the vicomte \de Desandrouin, whose tenacity under disappointment
led to the discovery, imported 200 Belgian miners and their families
from Charleroi to help to bring the new pits into production). In
spite of the development of local production, Nord's dependence on
Belgian coal remained considerable, and was a source of weakness and
distress in troubled times. Towards the end of the century in the
Revolutionary Wars an Austrian threat to cut off supplies of coal to
Nord caused consternation among the local manufacturers. They feared
to see <squote>their commerce and manufactures completely destroyed by
competition and the interruption in the supply of Austrian coal</squote>.
Nord was as dependent upon Belgium for pig-iron for her metal
industries as she was for coal, even before the obsolescence of
charcoal smelting. The pays de Li&egrave;ge supplied the great
bulk of the needs of the Maubeuge and Valenciennes areas, the two
chief groups of metal-using \communes in the department. There
were only two blast furnaces in Nord at the time of the Revolution, at
Hayon and Fourmies: and it was said that these were preserved from
unsuccessful competition only by the tariff on Belgian iron.
   <p>At the turn of the century, therefore, French dependence
physically upon Belgian materials was very marked in the heavy
industries; but Belgian men and money were of little importance, and
she had no clear-cut technological lead. The new century brought no
immediate change. Indeed the second period of French occupation of
Belgian soil served only to accentuate the existing pattern. In 1814
the completion of the Mons-Cond&eacute; canal increased the ease with
which Mons coal might be sent to Nord (ten years later the opening of
the Saint-Quentin canal allowed the passage of Mons coal by a cheap
water route all the way to the Paris market). As the years passed,
however, Belgium did more than supply coal and raw pig for the iron
industry: Belgian firms took a leading part in the establishment of
modern works in Nord. In 1849 the largest metal works in Nord was the
Belgian S. A. Hauts-fourneaux, forges et laminoirs de
Hautmont, near Maubeuge. It had been built in 1842, and employed
more than 400 workers. It was only one of several Belgian metal firms
which became established in the Maubeuge area in the forties and
fifties to gain access to the French market, or even, as in the case
of Victor Dupont at Sous-le-Bois to avoid labour difficulties at home.
Maubeuge lay less than thirty miles up the valley of the Sambre from
Charleroi, one of the two largest centres of the Belgian iron
industry. Its metal industries were an extension across the national
frontier of the industries of Charleroi: its economic life was
orientated to Charleroi. The penetration of Belgian industry and
entrepreneurs is therefore very understandable. Belgian influence
extended further, however. There was at least one Belgian metal
venture in the Valenciennes metal region &mdash; the rolling mills at
Blanc-Misseron: and Belgian influence in Nord's most important
industry, textiles, was important. Belgian capital and personnel were
seldom directly concerned in the industry; but Belgian textile
machinery found a ready market in Nord. Once again Cockerill was the
great stimulus. Mahaim, after describing the early days of the
Cockerill plant in Li&egrave;ge, added, <squote>Then, with an astonishing
rapidity in view of the slowness of communications, the clothing
centres of northern France took part in the re-equipment. Once
Cockerill was established at Li&egrave;ge, his client&egrave;le appeared in
France.</squote>
   <p>While Belgian influence in Nord was considerable, it was less
marked here than in the parts of the Austrasian field which lay to the
east. Although Belgian coal and coke was indispensable to Nord;
Belgian firms in the van in the metal industry;  and Belgian
technological leadership often apparent, even in textiles, French
capital and industry could show reason for a claim to near equality.

<text id=LOBJ56>
   <p>In Italy, too, the part played by some of the provocative
post-war striking, openly aimed at factory-expropriation, in bringing
adherents and factory- and landowner-subscriptions to the Fascists, is
often ignored so that the story only seems to begin with the otherwise
inexplicable lorry-forays against Red centres, already in 1921 rising
to anarchic heights. Of course, the Italian governing classes were to
pay dearly for the mingled cynicism and cowardice with which they
finally allowed the apparatus of State to pass into the hands of the
leaders and organizers of the huge bands of street-fighters at whose
illegalities they had winked so long. The whole world was, in fact,
destined to pay for, before long, there were to be growing
apprehensions among the <quote>advanced</quote> as to whether Mussolini's
success would not attract power-hungry imitators in every land. In
Germany, for example, the ambitions of Adolf Hitler were certainly
stimulated, and in that suffering country there had already been such
threatening displays from the frustrated Right as the Kapp putsch
of 1920, the Erzberger murder of 1921, and the Rathenau murder of
1922. The attempted Nazi seizure of Bavaria, when it came in November
1923, enlisted Ludendorff's support. And it was not insignificant
that the Daily Mail should publish, in 1923, its own version of
Italian Fascismo's history and that the Labour Publishing Company
should issue a very different account. As September 1923 had seen a
Spanish Army coup sweep aside the politicians and institute,
without any obvious sign of public displeasure, the authoritarian
r&eacute;gime of Primo \de Rivera, the I.L.P.'s urge to issue
Matteotti's The \Fascisti Exposed, during 1924, becomes more
explicable. Yet Matteotti's murder in June 1924, a worse and more
widely-resented scandal than any he exposed when alive, failed
ultimately to weaken the Fascist grip on Italy and may in the long run
have served to strengthen it. Certainly, a third Dictatorship
appeared when General Pangalos seized control in Greece during the
summer of 1925.
   <p>All this, as it turned out, was not yet the primary danger to the
<quote>advanced</quote> and to their social democracy. Pangalos's dictatorship,
after all, was short lived, and Primo, in Spain, never built up and
doubtless despised, the Mussolini demagogy, complete with fighting
street-rowdies. In fact, despite some ominous undertones even in
Britain and France, not to mention Mussolini's increasing grip of
Italy, it might be assumed that democratic prospects were on the mend
between 1925 and the great <quote>economic blizzard</quote> which began towards
the end of 1929. It was when German unemployment began rising again
catastrophically in 1930 that Hitler, whose denunciation of Jews,
Versailles, and traitors, sold to Moscow or the Entente, had
become part of the German political scene, scented his first chances
of establishing an altogether more formidable dictatorship than
Mussolini's. And the street-fighter apparatus which some German
capitalists, fearful of Communism and Moscow, helped him to perfect,
began to assume, in the S.A. and the S.S., forms destined to
leave the Italian models far behind. Already by the summer of 1932, a
possible Storm Troopers' transfer from the harrying of Communists and
Jews in the streets to operations on the Polish and Czech frontiers
was being taken seriously at the German War Department.
   <p>By 1932, of course, English theorists of the Left had been
speculating for some time on how a British Dictatorship threat might
come to be used against them and, in point of fact, several times
during the 1920s Winston Churchill had been cast for the part of the
British Mussolini. But there were mockers among them who claimed that
the British ruling classes would never have to meditate the risks of
calling in Fascism if the Labour Movement allowed itself to be run out
of power as tamely as had been the case in 1924 and 1931. These
mockers of <quote>gradualism</quote> were in favour of assuming in advance that
yet another <quote>conspiracy</quote> would be attempted against any third
Labour Government, even if possessed of a Majority, and that such a
Government was therefore entitled to arm itself with drastic emergency
Powers usable against all manner of <quote>capitalist sabotage</quote>. It was
a most dangerous line of advocacy, almost certain to lead not merely
to Fascism but to bloodshed and the complete antagonization of still
important Radical forces, yet for a time it became the policy of the
Socialist League led by Stafford Cripps.
   <p>There had been Radicals who had prophesied that Labour would
itself breed British Fascism's would-be leader, and they had been
able, as justification, to point to Mussolini's violent Socialist past
and to Hitler's description of what he stood for as National
Socialism. And, of course, it provided an additional reason for
Radicals to refuse absorption into the Labour movement to find its
most discontented wing, after 1931, forming Mosley's New Party or
entering Cripps's Socialist League or, finally, like John Strachey,
preaching a break-away into Leninite Communism. As Mosley might well
have become a <quote>Man of Destiny</quote> if Hitler's success against Britain
had been greater than it was, some remarks on his strange political
career between 1918 and 1930 are justifiable. The heir to a baronetcy
and considerable wealth, he had, after some service in France, entered
the <quote>Coupon Parliament</quote> at the age of twenty-two and married Lord
Curzon's daughter in 1920. But, before long, the urge to make a mark
had led him on to activities on the Irish Question which his
brother-Conservatives found unpardonable, and after four years as
Conservative M.P. for Harrow between 1918 and 1922, he had to
overcome party resistance to retain his seat in the Bonar Law
Parliament as an Independent Conservative. By the time of the first
Labour Ministry in 1924, he was lending Labour <quote>Independent</quote>
support for some time before he announced his conversion. Thereafter
he fought his way back into the House for Smethwick as a Socialist,
was admitted to the friendship and confidence of MacDonald and
accompanied him on a continental tour in the autumn of 1928. When he
entered MacDonald's second Government as Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster with a place on Mr. Thomas's Committee for combating
Unemployment, there were already those who predicted that he would
succeed to the party Leadership. Possibly his ultimate chances were
made no worse by the fact that he resigned in May 1930 when, despite
growing unemployment, he found virtually all his suggestions,
summarized in the once-notorious <quote>Mosley Memorandum</quote>, treated as
inadmissible.
   <p>Mosley's long and pertinacious struggle during many ensuing
months to convert the Leadership or force its hand, with Back-Bench
aid, had some remarkable features &mdash; particularly during the Llandudno
Conference of October 1930 and at the extraordinary meeting of the
Parliamentary Labour Party held on January 27, 1931. It was, to some
extent, because he came so near to dividing the Party dangerously
between <quote>Mosleyites</quote> and the rest that the Leadership succeeded in
defeating him and never more effectively than when urging, privately,
that Mosley was merely a rich young man whose ambition was
over-reaching itself. Mosley persisted, until March 1931, with the
effort to create an Action Group within the party but, under the frown
of official disapproval, its numbers sank from forty to twenty. When
the final break came, only six Members in all were available as the
foundation of a New Party and the six included Mosley himself and his
wife, Lady Cynthia. The election of October 1931, moreover, came in
circumstances peculiarly unfavourable to the New Party which polled
badly and lost all Parliamentary representation.
   <p>Though a great deal is still fundamentally unexplained in the
story of the New Party's evolution towards an Anti-Semitic Fascism, it
is not impossible to find some guidance by checking the twenty-four
constituencies before whom New Party candidates placed themselves.
Stepney and Whitechapel were two of those constituencies destined,
before long, to supply a steady stream of Blackshirt recruits and to
become the nucleus of metropolitan Fascism, and both those areas had,
for a couple of generations, heard much complaint of Jewish
immigrants, Jewish employers, Jewish business methods, Jewish
landlords, and much else. It only needed reports of what the Nazis
were doing, especially after Hitler became Chancellor, for Blackshirt
contingents to become available not merely in the East End, but in
Islington, Hackney, Stoke Newington, and many other quarters of London
where there were prosperous Jewish businesses and yet much native
unemployment and distress. Of course, the very name Blackshirt, and
the uniform, is an indication that it was Mussolini, rather than
Hitler, who was being originally imitated. And though some of
Mosley's Action associates like Oliver Baldwin and John Strachey were
shocked into a complete break with him when they first discovered him
sanctioning, in his party's rooms and meeting-places, exercises in
physical force, there was a possible defence in the plea, that after
he had left the Labour Party, Mosley's own meetings were broken up by
dangerous mobs, and that in Birmingham and Glasgow police protection
had to be secured.
   <p>It has, of course, been the fashion of Communists and Fascists to
demand complete freedom of speech and assembly for themselves until
they are prepared to destroy it and all the other democratic
<quote>liberties</quote> by force. And the Radical tradition of tolerance for
the extremest views is so strong in Britain that matters have normally
reached a dangerous stage before any widespread assent can be obtained
for <quote>coercion</quote>. And if <quote>Reds</quote> were still, in 1934 and 1935,
being allowed to experiment unceasingly with organizing <quote>Unemployed
Marches and Demonstrations</quote> that might become something more, the
case for exceptional vigilance and severity against the Blackshirts
was correspondingly weaker. Yet by 1934 a British Fascist movement of
some potential strength was certainly being reared, already capable of
attracting support from those who feared <quote>Red</quote> plans and activities
and wanted Britain rescued, besides, from the depths, as they
considered it, of the ignoble pacifism to which Radicalism and
Socialism had brought the country. The most formidable patron the
Blackshirts acquired, for a time, was the great newspaper magnate,
Lord Rothermere, though he finally shrank, under the stimulus of an
enormous roar of <quote>progressive</quote> indignation, from the odium of
swallowing virulent Anti-Semitism with his Anti-Bolshevism. As
Rothermere put it himself:
<quote>
   <p>I refused to give more than ordinary publicity to Sir Oswald
Mosley's Blackshirt movement the moment I discovered it had an
anti-Jewish bias. I supported it at first with the idea of promoting
a right wing appanage of the Conservative Party, which should form a
counterblast to left wing activities. Mosley's correct procedure was
to develop a Youth movement inspired by anti-Bolshevist ideals,
instead of basing himself on Continental models which, obviously,
would not appeal to our British mentality or temperament.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>Yet if he withdrew special patronage from Mosley's Blackshirts,
Rothermere had an obvious admiration for the services he considered
Hitler and Mussolini to have rendered their countries as well as a
readiness to lead a great Air-Rearmament Campaign which constituted
him  one of the hopes in Britain of those who wanted the
country to be at once too strong and too friendly for the Dictators to
dream of attacking. It was, perhaps, as well therefore for the
general cause of <quote>progress</quote> in Britain that all parties in
Parliament decided that they had had enough of provocative Fascist
tactics in the East End after some notorious affrays in October 1936
faced a dismayed nation with the prospect of a repetition in Britain
of full Nazi-style street hostilities. And Sir John Simon's Public
Order Bill, to ban the wearing of uniforms in connection with
political objects and the maintenance by private persons of
associations of military or quasi-military character, was, if
specially welcome to Radicals and Socialists, hardly opposed during
its rapid progress through Parliament in November and December 1936.
Fascism, however, if deprived of one of its most dangerous and
provocative means of display, remained a possible peril to
<quote>progressives</quote> till the Fascist Dictators were defeated and
destroyed.
   <p>Yet for years the destruction that finally overtook the Fascist
Dictators seemed most unlikely and the chances to be the other way as
the notorious case of the Spanish <quote>progressives</quote> seemed to show
between 1936 and 1939.

<text id=LOBJ57>
He yielded. On 25th January he issued two strongly worded Cabinet
Orders. The first reiterated the command that Bismarck was to be kept
informed of the course of military operations, and directed Moltke to
take such effective steps to do so that Bismarck would have no further
cause for complaint; while the second expressly ordered that in any
correspondence with members of the French Government or Delegation
which might have any political significance, and in the drafting of
any replies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was always to be
consulted. The royal decision was unequivocal and settled the matter.
   <p>The reply which Moltke at first projected was virtually a letter
of resignation. The royal order, he said, was <quote>\ungna"dig</quote>,
un-Gracious. His communications with Trochu, he maintained, had been
strictly military. All he had withheld from Bismarck was information
and plans which would be of value to the Chancellor only if he as well
as Moltke were advising the King about operations; and rather than
have the war conducted by such a dual authority Moltke declared
himself ready <quote>to leave the relevant operations and the
responsibility for them to the Federal Chancellor alone. I await</quote>,
he concluded grimly, <quote>Your Imperial Majesty's most gracious decision
on the matter.</quote> The letter which he actually sent, however, was
considerably milder. In it he merely defended his conduct with
dignity, complained at Bismarck's repeated and unjustified
accusations, asked for a clear ruling about his relationship with the
Chancellor, and requested the Emperor's protection against any further
attacks. The Imperial secretaries drafted an anodyne reply, but it
was not sent. There was no need. On 28th January an armistice was
signed with the Government of National Defence. For the preservation
of peaceful relations within Royal Headquarters it had come not a
moment too soon.
   <p>
   <p>Bismarck's d&eacute;marche of 18th January took effect almost
immediately. Two days later, on the evening of 20th January, Trochu
sent his request for an armistice to bury the dead after Buzenval.
The Kaiser at once referred the request, not to Moltke, but to
Bismarck; and Bismarck grimly refused it. The brusqueness of the
refusal, the failure to take advantage of what was generally sensed in
Versailles to be the beginning of the end, seems so out of keeping
with Bismarck's desire to renew peace negotiations that the
explanation must surely be sought in Bismarck's attitude to the
earlier exchanges between Moltke and Trochu. In this new overture he
may have seen another move in the negotiations which he believed the
soldiers to be conducting behind his back, and it is not surprising
that he should have taken advantage of his new established dominance
to end them. In any case he was convinced that after the failure of
the Buzenval sortie capitulation could not be long delayed, and then
the peace-proposals of the Imperial party could be seriously
considered. Cl&eacute;ment Duvernois was expected at any moment. But
Duvernois did not come: the stubbornness of the emigr&eacute; group in
Brussels threw his whole time-table out of joint, and before he was
ready to talk to Bismarck Jules Favre had reached Versailles.
   <p>Favre arrived at German Headquarters late in the evening of 23rd
January. His journey followed a day of stormy debate while the
Government in Paris discussed whether he should negotiate for an
armistice for the fortress of Paris only or for the whole of France.
The question was left open: he was instructed only to discover what
terms were available, without betraying the desperate state of the
city's supplies. Favre himself hoped to secure, as a minimum, that
there should be facilities given for the free election of a National
Assembly to decide the question of war or peace; that there should be
no entry of Prussian troops into Paris and no imprisonment in Germany
of the garrison, and that civil war should not be provoked by an
attempt to disarm the Garde Nationale. Failing these
conditions, he was prepared to threaten a renewal of the fighting and
ultimately a total surrender which would compel the Germans to accept
complete responsibility for the civil administration of Paris.
   <p>Bismarck was able to bluff much more effectively than Favre. As
at Ferri&egrave;res, he was able to state truthfully that he was in
negotiation with the Empress, who alone represented lawful authority,
for the summoning of the only legal representative body in France, the
Corps L&eacute;gislatif. Favre's project of a freely elected Assembly
he declared to be no longer realisable: under the dictatorial
republicanism of Gambetta elections would not be free. He was
prepared however to talk in general terms about conditions for Paris.
He agreed that the garrison should not be sent as prisoners to
Germany, where their presence would only be an embarrassment; he
considered that although opinion in the Army and in Germany would
insist on a triumphal entry into the city, the scope of this might be
strictly limited; and while refusing to waive the disarmament of the
Garde Nationale, he suggested that the most politically
reliable battalions alone should be allowed to keep their arms. The
contrast between these terms and the draconian conditions demanded by
Moltke speaks for itself. By the end of the first evening's discussion
it was evident that the chances of agreement were good. Bismarck said
nothing to the curious bystanders as he left the room in which he had
been closeted alone with Favre, but he whistled a hunting call of
unmistakable meaning: the chase was over.
   <p>Next day, 24th January, both negotiators came into the open.
Cl&eacute;ment Duvernois had still not arrived, and Bismarck consented to
abandon his negotiations with the Empress if he could reach agreement
with the Government of National Defence. In return Favre agreed to
sign an armistice covering the whole of France, and to ensure that no
resistance by the Delegation would be allowed to stand in the way of
its implementation. Only the question of the armament of the
Garde Nationale remained unsettled, and on this Bismarck,
faced by Favre's convincing assurance that it would be physically
impossible to disarm them without a civil war, was eventually to
yield. For the rest, the Government in Paris with some reason
accepted Bismarck's terms as <quote>\inesp&eacute;r&eacute;es</quote>. Thanks to
the Chancellor's diplomatic moderation, the honour of the city and the
troops who had defended it would remain intact. On 25th January Favre
was therefore authorised to sign an armistice for three weeks, to
enable a National Assembly to meet at Bordeaux and finally resolve the
question of war or peace.
   <p>So far Bismarck had carried on the negotiations single-handed.
Now the military had unavoidably to be called in to settle the
details of the armistice. It was unfortunate that this stage in the
negotiations coincided exactly with the crisis of the quarrel between
the civil and military authorities; and Bismarck rubbed salt into the
wounds of his defeated rivals by insisting that the agreement with the
French should take the form, not of a Capitulation, which would
signify surrender, but of a Convention, which indicated only a
negotiated settlement between equals. Moltke began attending
conferences on 26th January, the day after his rebuff by the Emperor.
The French negotiators noted, without fully appreciating the cause,
the unpleasant contrast between his grim, unsmiling dourness and the
easy affability of Bismarck, and Bismarck openly stigmatised Moltke's
attitude as mean, pettifogging and unrealistic. But the French had
trouble enough with their own military representatives. Trochu's oath
never to capitulate made it impossible for him to undertake the
responsibility of negotiating surrender, and Ducrot had never been
forgiven by the German Emperor for his apparent breach of parole after
Sedan. Favre therefore found to accompany him a certain General
Beaufort \d'Hautpoul, who proved quite incapable of carrying on
negotiations. The French attributed his peculiar condition to
honourable mortification; the Germans, less charitably, said he was
drunk. He was succeeded after one embarrassing day by General \de
Valdan, Vinoy's Chief of Staff, by whom, on 28th January, the
armistice was signed.
   <p>The armistice was to take effect in Paris immediately &mdash; indeed on
Bismarck's suggestion the bombardment and counter-bombardment had
ceased two days earlier &mdash; and was to come into action elsewhere in
France in three days' time. It was to last until 19th February,
during which time full facilities would be given for an Assembly to be
freely elected and to meet at Bordeaux, where it would debate whether
the war should continue and on what terms peace should be made.
Meanwhile Paris was to pay a war-indemnity of two hundred million
francs. It was to yield up its perimeter forts and dismount the guns
from its walls, but the ground between the forts and the city would be
considered neutral, and no German troops would enter Paris. The
Germans would provide full facilities for the rapid re-provisioning of
the city. 12,000 men of the Paris garrison would retain their arms,
an essential minimum to preserve order, as Favre insisted. The rest
were to surrender their arms and remain in Paris until the end of the
armistice; when, if peace had not yet been made, they were to be taken
over by the Germans as prisoners-of-war.
   <p>The terms for the rest of the country were less satisfactory to
the French. It was agreed that a military demarcation line should be
drawn, from which both armies should withdraw ten kilometres; but
Favre and his military advisers depended entirely on the Germans for
information about the position of the existing front line, and Moltke
was in no mood to interpret doubtful cases to his opponents'
advantage. The agreed line was to involve at several points the
withdrawal of French troops from positions which they had quite
securely held. Moreover about the operations still in progress in the
Jura both Favre and Bismarck were equally ill-informed. Favre knew
only that the fortress of Belfort was still intact and that Bourbaki's
relieving force still held the field. To enforce an armistice in this
area might be to spoil the chance of a military victory which would
considerably strengthen the French hand when it came to negotiating
the final peace. Moltke, though he had received little news from the
swiftly moving Manteuffel, was sufficiently confident of the outcome
to allow Favre to nurse his illusions; so by common agreement military
operations were allowed to continue in the department of Jura, C&ocirc;te
\d'Or, and Doubs. When Favre telegraphed the news of the armistice to
Gambetta on the evening of 28th January he made the astonishing and
notorious mistake of failing to inform him of this omission. How this
error contributed to the final agonies of the Army of the East we have
already seen.
   <p>Moltke admitted the validity of the political considerations
which had led Bismarck to conclude the Convention with the Government
of National Defence, but he made no secret of his dissatisfaction with
the moderation of its terms. In this he spoke for the Army, but not
for the Army alone. His views were widely echoed throughout Germany.
On the French side it was the civilians, Gambetta and the politicians
of the Paris Clubs, who wished to prolong the war after all but a tiny
minority of their military advisers had urged the conclusion of peace.
The relaxing of the tension which was brought about by even a
temporary suspension of hostilities undermined the strength of the
extremists on both sides. The parties of guerre &agrave; outrance
dwindled to impotent if vociferous cliques at Bordeaux and
Versailles, able to embarrass the peace-makers but not to thwart them.
That this was so in the French ranks was due to the openly expressed
determination of the French people, through their elected
representatives, to have peace at any cost. But Bismarck, in dealing
with his own military party, did not enjoy a comparable advantage.
Instead public opinion in Germany as overwhelmingly supported a peace
of extermination as did that in the Allied nations in 1918. If the
opposition to Bismarck at Versailles which had been at its height on
the eve of the armistice abated rapidly once the armistice was signed,
it was not because the military party was accepting defeat with a good
grace.

Secondly, even if the bitter struggle for the hegemony of the
peninsula was punctuated by spells of mutual tolerance, these respites
did not last long. The years when the three rival cults were
celebrated on an equal footing at Toledo had no more permanent result
than had the fleeting Christian-Muslim rapprochement achieved in
Sicily under the rule of Frederick 2, Stupor Mundi, in the
same period. In the fifteenth century, at any rate, the average
Iberian Christian &mdash; like any other European &mdash; never referred to the
Muslim and the Jewish faiths without adding some injurious epithet.
Hatred and intolerance, not sympathy and understanding, for alien
creeds and races was the general rule. <quote>Moors</quote> (i.e.
Muslims), Jews, and Gentiles were alike regarded as being doomed to
hell fire in the next world. It inevitably followed that they were
not likely to be treated with much consideration by Christians in this
one.
   <p>The intolerance was not, of course, only on one side. The
Christian crusade had its counterpart in the Muslim \jihad, or
holy war against the unbeliever. The orthodox Muslim regarded with
horror all those who would <quote>give associates to God</quote>; and this was
just what the Christians did with their Trinity, their Virgin Mary,
and (to some extent) with their saints.
   <p>Medieval Europe was a harsh and rugged school, and the softer
graces of civilization were not more widely cultivated in Portugal
than they were elsewhere. A turbulent and treacherous nobility and
gentry; an ignorant and lax clergy; doltish, if hard-working, peasants
and fishermen; and a town rabble of artisans and day-labourers, like
the Lisbon mob described by E&ccedil;a \de Queiroz five centuries later,
<quote>fanatical, filthy, and ferocious</quote> &mdash; these constituted the social
classes from which the pioneer discoverers and colonizers were drawn.
Anyone who doubts this need only read the graphic pages of Fern&atilde;o
Lopes, <quote>the best chronicler of any age or nation,</quote> as Robert
Southey described him.
   <p>The first stage of the overseas expansion of Europe can be
regarded as beginning with the capture of Ceuta by the Portuguese in
1415 and culminating in the circumnavigation of the globe by the
Spanish ship Victoria in 1519-22. The Portuguese and Spaniards
had their precursors in the conquest of the Atlantic Ocean, but the
efforts of these adventurers had not changed the course of world
history. Vikings had voyaged to North America in the early Middle
Ages, but the last of their isolated settlements on Greenland had
succumbed to the rigours of the weather and the attacks of the Eskimo
before the end of the fifteenth century. Italian and Catalan galleys
from the Mediterranean

had boldly ventured into the Atlantic on voyages of discovery in the
late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries; but what they sought
is uncertain, and what they found is equally obscure, though they may
well have sighted Madeira and some of the Azores. Why did the
Iberians succeed where their Mediterranean predecessors had failed?
and why did Portugal take the lead when the Biscayan seamen were as
good as any in Europe?
   <p>Historians are still far from agreed on the precise answers to
these questions, but the main impulses behind what is known as the
<quote>Age of Discovery</quote> evidently came from a mixture of religious,
economic, strategic and political factors. These were by no means
always mixed in the same proportions; and motives inspired by Mammon
were often inextricably blended with things pertaining to Caesar and
to God. At the risk of oversimplification, it may, perhaps, be said
that the four main motives that inspired the Portuguese were, in
chronological but overlapping order, (1) crusading zeal, (2)
desire for Guinea gold, (3) the quest for Prester John, and (4)
the search for spices. An important contributory factor was that,
during the whole of the fifteenth century, Portugal was a united
kingdom which experienced only one brief episode of civil strife. The
consolidation of the power of the Portuguese Crown during this period
forms a marked contrast with the confused situation obtaining in the
rest of Europe. France was distracted by the closing stages of the
Hundred Years War &mdash; 1415 was the date of the battle of Agincourt as
well as of the capture of Ceuta &mdash; and by rivalry with Burgundy;
England by the struggle with France and the wars of the Roses; and
Spain and Italy by dynastic and other internal problems.
   <p>The seizure of Ceuta in 1415 and, more important, its retention,
were probably inspired mainly by crusading ardour to deal a blow at
the Infidel, and by the desire of the half-English princes of Portugal
to be dubbed knights on the field of battle in a spectacular manner.
Economic and strategic motives may also have played a part, since
Ceuta was both a thriving commercial centre and a bridgehead for an
invasion across the straits of Gibraltar. It has been suggested that
the fertile corn-growing regions in the hinterland also formed an
attraction for the Portuguese, whose own country was even then
normally deficient in cereals. Ceuta was one of the terminal ports
for the Trans-Sahara gold-trade, though how far the Portuguese knew
this before their capture of the city is uncertain. But the
occupation of Ceuta undoubtedly enabled them to obtain some
information about the Negro lands of the Upper Niger and Senegal river
regions, where the gold came from. They soon began to see that they
might, perhaps, establish contact with those lands by sea, and so
divert the gold-trade from the <quote>caravans of the Old Sahara</quote> and the
Muslim middlemen of Barbary. They had the more incentive to do this
since Western Europe in general, and Portugal in particular, were
then suffering a serious shortage of precious metals. This was partly
due to the drain of silver and gold to the East, to pay for spices and
other Oriental exports, and partly to the insufficient production of
the Central European mines.
   <p>The crusading impulse and search for gold were soon reinforced by
the quest for Prester John. This mythical potentate was vaguely
located in the <quote>Indies</quote> &mdash; an elastic and shifting term that often
embraced Ethiopia and East Africa, as well as what little was known of
Asia. The passage of time, romantic travellers' tales &mdash; of which
Marco Polo's supply the classic example &mdash; and wishful thinking, all
combined to build up the late medieval belief that Prester John was a
mighty, if probably schismatical Christian priest-king. His domains
were believed to lie somewhere in the rear of the Islamic powers that
occupied a wide belt of territory from Morocco to the Black Sea, thus
cutting off Christendom from direct contact with the peoples of Asia
and the isolated Coptic Christian kingdom of Abyssinia. From 1402
onwards, occasional Abyssinian monks and envoys reached Europe, and at
least one of them got as far as Lisbon in 1452; but the Portuguese,
like most other people, still seem to have had only a hazy idea of
what or where his country was.
   <p>The mixed motivation behind the Portuguese overseas expansion was
explicitly recognized in the Papal Bull Romanus Pontifex
(January 8th, 1455), which categorically commended the crusading
inspiration of the Infante Dom Henrique and his desire to reach the
mysterious Christian potentate(s) of the Indies by circumnavigating
Africa. This Bull also recognized the commercial motive inherent in
Portuguese expansion by granting the King of Portugal and his
successors the monopoly of the trade with the inhabitants of the newly
discovered

regions, subject to the proviso that the sale of war material to the
enemies of the Faith was forbidden. Finally, it may be mentioned that
as the Portuguese pushed their exploratory voyages down the west coast
of Africa, they added the acquisition of Negro slaves to that of
Guinea gold, and the search for spices to the quest for Prester John.
The spices, however, only appear as a major motive after the death of
Prince Henry in 1460, by which time the West African slave-trade was
an established fact.
   <p>The Portuguese voyages of discovery and trade down the west coast
of Africa did not really get going until Cape Bojador (or, more
probably, Cape Juby, which was then apparently known by the former
name) was rounded in 1434, after many futile efforts. The voyages
then continued systematically, and a great spurt of progress was made
during the eight-year regency (1440-48) of Dom Pedro, elder brother of
the better publicized Dom Henrique, belatedly and somewhat
inappropriately named <quote>the Navigator.</quote> Prior to his assumption of
the Regency, Dom Pedro had been violently critical of the policy of
holding Ceuta, and had shown no particular interest in the voyages of
discovery patronized by his brother. But once in power, as so often
happens, Dom Pedro adopted wholeheartedly some of the policies that he
had previously criticized, or to which he had been indifferent. All
talk of abandoning Ceuta in exchange for the freedom of his youngest
brother, Dom Fernando (who had been held as a prisoner by the Moors
since a disastrous attack on Tangier in 1437), was dropped, and Dom
Pedro actively backed the voyages of discovery and the colonization of
the Atlantic islands. Nevertheless, Dom Henrique's share in these
twin enterprises was the more important in the long run. The voyages
themselves, and the colonization

of Madeira and the Azores, which began soon after their discovery &mdash; or
re-discovery &mdash; in 1419-27 were largely financed from the revenues of
the military Order of Christ, of which Dom Henrique was the
administrator and governor (but not the Grand Master as is often
stated) from 1420 until his death forty years later. Some of the
leading Lisbon merchants also had a hand in financing and organizing
these voyages. From 1470 to 1475 they were leased on the basis of a
monopoly contract to a certain Fern&atilde;o Gomes, under whose
administration a large stretch of the Guinea coast was opened up to
Portuguese enterprise and trade.
   <p>It is still uncertain how much was directly due to government
initiative and to resources supplied by the Crown or by the Order of
Christ, and how much was due to private enterprise, or to both the
Crown and the merchant-adventurers acting in conjunction. But it can
be said without undue simplification that right from the beginning,
the planning, organization, and financing of these voyages owed a
great deal to intelligent government initiative and support, as
personified in the activities of Dom Henrique, Dom Pedro, and, above
all, of King Dom Jo&atilde;o 2 in the final stages (1481-95). In other
words, as C. R. Beazley pointed out over sixty years ago, Prince
Henry's achievement was that he <quote>altered the conditions of maritime
exploration by giving permanence, organization, and governmental
support to a movement which had up to this time proved disappointing
for lack of those very means.</quote>
   <p>It was this steady government support that gave the Portuguese
the edge over their Spanish neighbours and rivals, who for long
contested the papal awards that granted a monopoly of the West African
coastal trade to the former. But save during the years 1475-1480,
when the Spanish adventurers made determined but unsuccessful attempts
to secure the lion's share of

the Guinea trade for themselves, the Spaniards did not receive the
same consistent and energetic support from their rulers as did the
Portuguese from theirs. Moreover, for much of the fifteenth century,
Spain's cereal and financial problems were less acute than were those
of Portugal, and therefore the Spaniards had not the same economic
incentives to seek new lands to conquer or to exploit. Finally, the
existence of the Moorish kingdom of Granada on Andalusian soil, the
prior commitments of the Crown of Aragon in the Mediterranean, and the
need to strengthen the Crown of Castile against unruly vassals at
home, provided powerful distractions that were not present to the same
extent in Portugal.
   <p>The actual voyages down the barren and featureless Saharan coast
presented no exceptional difficulties to experienced seamen, other
than the legendary but none the less real terrors of the unknown.
These latter included the common, though not universal, belief that
the torrid zone was too hot to support life, and that the Mar
Tenebroso, or <quote>Sea of Darkness</quote> south of Cape Nun, was too
shallow and too dangerous for navigation.

<text id=LOBJ59>
   <p>Lytton's telegram announcing his intentions reached the India
Office on 9 September: Cranbrook was not at this time in London: he
was at Braemore in the north of Scotland. He received his copy of the
telegram on the 12th. Meanwhile Horace Walpole, his private
secretary, a permanent civil servant, who was suspicious of Lytton's
policies, had read Lytton's telegram, noticed that it proposed to send
the mission off from Peshawar in less than a week, and decided that
the telegram ought to be answered. He, therefore, at the same time as
he sent Cranbrook his copy of the telegram, sent also a copy to
Beaconsfield at Hughenden and one to Salisbury at the Foreign Office.
The effect on both of them, and on Cranbrook when he read it, was
immediate. To all of them it seemed that the proposal to insist on
the expulsion of the Russian mission before the beginning of
Anglo-Afghan negotiations would be <squote>an affront which a great power
could not endure</squote>. It would intensify Russian activity in
Afghanistan; it would bring the Russian government into direct
conflict with the government of India; it would endanger peace in
Europe and it must, therefore, before it was attempted, be considered
very fully by the Cabinet.
   <p>The Cabinet, however, could not meet. Its members were scattered
over the country houses of England and Scotland. It was clear, from
Lytton's telegram, that he did not know of the diplomatic protest to
St. Petersburg and did not intend to wait for a Russian answer. The
impression made by the telegram, as Horace Walpole found when he
visited Salisbury on the morning of the 11th, was the thought that
~<squote>Lord Lytton &lsqb;was&rsqb; going a little too fast and plunging us into an
Afghan war</squote>. The effects of such a war would be felt not only in
Europe, but also in the constituencies. Less than a week later the
prime minister was noticing <squote>symptoms... by no means confined to one
party</squote> of a <squote>strong and rising feeling respecting this Afghan
business</squote>. <squote>So long</squote>, he told Salisbury, <squote>as the country
thought they had obtained <quote>Peace with honor</quote>, the conduct of
H.M. Government was popular, but if the country finds there is no
peace, they will be apt also to conclude there is no honour</squote>. And
his conclusion was not that Lytton should make the pace but that
Salisbury himself, in Cranbrook's absence, should make sure that
Lytton was properly informed of the views of a Government that would
need to act <squote>with decision and firmness</squote>.
   <p>It is, as we have seen, by no means clear that the decision to
send the diplomatic protest to Russia on 19 August had been
accompanied by a decision to delay Chamberlain's mission until a reply
had arrived from St. Petersburg. So long as it was imagined that
Lytton knew his limitations, Salisbury seems to have attached little
importance to the protest. But as soon as it seemed that Lytton might
be steering towards war, it comes forward from the back of Salisbury's
mind as an occasion, or excuse, for delaying Lytton's action in India:
and as a move in the parliamentary game which would, when the time
comes, show that the British government had done its best to avoid war
and accomplish by peaceful diplomacy what Afghan or Russian obstinacy
had made impossible. Beaconsfield, as soon as he saw the telegram of
8 September and had talked to Salisbury, wrote tartly to Cranbrook
regretting that Lytton seemed not to know of the protest. Salisbury,
on the 11th, after correspondence with Beaconsfield, telegraphed
Horace Walpole to ask Cranbrook urgently for authority to stop Lytton
sending the mission until the Russian reply had arrived. Cranbrook,
meanwhile, feeling the same way in Scotland, had sent a telegram to
Walpole forbidding the departure of the mission until further orders.
On the 14th, two days before Chamberlain was supposed to start, this
message was in Lytton's hands.
   <p>When Lytton received the telegram, however, he was in no mood to
delay. The events he had set on foot in August could not now be
controlled. Chamberlain was already in Peshawar; Cavagnari had
committed himself in the Khyber: the native ambassador had left for
Kabul and the wide publicity Lytton had given to the mission through
his private press officer in India, made it difficult to give the
slightest sign of turning back. His information about the state of
opinion in England came mainly through Burne in the India Office.
Burne had been Lytton's private secretary in India until he returned
to England with a sick wife in the spring of 1878. When his wife died
and he returned to work at the India Office, he spent much time and
money providing Lytton with telegraphic reports of the state of
feeling in England and of conditions in the India Office. By the
middle of August he had spent, out of Lytton's pocket, &pound;197 on
private telegrams. Burne was not altogether a reliable guide. From
his telegrams Lytton gathered, what was only half true, that there was
much support for him in Afghan matters. He learnt from Burne's
letters, also, what he thought he knew himself, that Cranbrook was too
much under Salisbury's thumb, was lazy, well-meaning, and <squote>timid</squote>.
Nor did he believe, or imagine anyone else seriously to believe, that
the protest to St. Petersburg would achieve any result. Finally,
perhaps most important of all, he knew that Cranbrook was not in
London when the restraining telegrams were sent and he saw in them the
influence, not altogether friendly and certainly not at all sensible,
of Lord Salisbury. These things encouraged him to disobey.
   <p>On the 13th, together with the telegram in which he was first
told about the protest to St. Petersburg, Lytton also received one
to say that Cranbrook would not send detailed approval and
modification of Chamberlain's instructions until the Russian reply
arrived in London. On the 17th, Lytton heard that an abstract of this
reply had been received from Plunkett, the charg&eacute; d'affaires
in St. Petersburg: he heard also that it was not satisfactory. But
he was given no authority to send the mission off and no authority had
arrived on the morning of the 21st. On the 16th he had, in accordance
with Cranbrook's telegram of the 13th, postponed Chamberlain's
departure from Peshawar for five days. On the 20th, he ordered
Chamberlain to move forward to Jamrud: on the 21st, these five days
having passed, he told him to enter Afghanistan.
   <p>In sending Chamberlain forward in this way, Lytton did not wish
to provoke war. He had written a friendly, though overbearing, letter
to Sher Ali on the 14th asking again for his cooperation. He did not
suppose that Sher Ali would refuse to admit the mission; and he hoped
that Chamberlain would, within a week, be established in Kabul. His
purpose in forcing the pace was therefore not so much to commit the
cabinet to a policy of which it did not approve, as to achieve, by
rapid action on the spot, a success which he supposed the Cabinet to
desire but which, because it was hampered by all the stupidities of
<squote>democratic</squote> England, and wrestling in the clutches of <squote>that
deformed and abortive offspring of perennial political fornication,
the present British constitution</squote>, it could not easily authorize or
agree upon. At the same time, the publicity with which the mission
was sent to Jamrud, gave to its conduct an appearance of deliberate
finality which was no accident. Chamberlain had not wanted to go
forward to Jamrud to ask for entry into Afghanistan. He, a great
frontier officer with the great frontier officer's personal prestige,
did not want to risk a snubbing at the Afghan frontier which would
affect that prestige whatever might be done afterwards to avenge it.
He would have preferred to find out from Peshawar whether his mission
would be admitted; and, if it were refused, to take whatever action
might be necessary from there. But for Lytton this was not enough.
This was a spectacular moment. This was Sher Ali's last chance. A
great public affront, one of India's greatest frontier officers,
waiting on the Afghan border and turned away by the commander of an
outlying Afghan post &mdash; this, if Sher Ali were really hostile, must
certainly convince the Cabinet, and might even impress the Opposition.
Chamberlain was chosen because he was, of active Indian frontier
statesmen, the greatest pupil of Lord Lawrence. Lawrence, the
greatest name amongst Lytton's critics, had attacked Lytton's frontier
policy with mounting hostility ever since he arrived in India. If a
lawrentian of Chamberlain's importance were snubbed by the Afghans,
Lawrence would have an important weapon removed from his critical
armoury. So Lytton in India, like Beaconsfield and Salisbury in
London, continued his political posturings.
   <p>Chamberlain moved from Peshawar to Jamrud on 20 September. On
the following morning he sent Cavagnari and Colonel Jenkins, the
commander of the mission's escort, together with a small section of
the escort, on to Ali Musjid to ask for admission to Afghanistan.
They were halted by Afghan troops a mile from the fort and forbidden
to come closer. Faiz Mohamed, the commander of the garrison (whom
Cavagnari knew well), asked Cavagnari to give him time to refer the
request to Kabul. Cavagnari refused. He said that unless Faiz
Mohamed specifically forbade the mission to advance, it would advance
on the following morning. Faiz Mohamed replied that he would attack
the mission if it attempted to pass Ali Musjid. Cavagnari and Jenkins
thereupon returned to Jamrud and reported their failure to
Chamberlain. Chamberlain reported the failure to Lytton: and Lytton,
from Simla, ordered Chamberlain to return to Peshawar. So ended, he
thought, the <squote>first round of the rubber</squote>. He could now prepare to
coerce Sher Ali.
   <p>With the repulse of the mission, Lytton's actions on the frontier
became clear and vigorous: Sher Ali had shown himself to be hostile:
of that in Lytton's mind there could be no doubt. He must be upset:
his treachery demanded his downfall. To that end all the forces of
the government of India must be turned. The problem, in this respect,
was a problem in political warfare, how may one best upset an
inconvenient neighbour? Also, how may one with the smallest
expenditure of energy establish a new r&eacute;gime in Kabul? Lytton was
not a soldier; he was a diplomat who had spent the better part of his
professional life in comparatively junior positions in civilized
capitals. He had an almost vicious contempt for military
<squote>bumpkins</squote> when they could not understand that large political
objects may often best be accomplished by employing a small military
force. If he could arrange the deposition of Sher Ali without
fighting a battle, could see an anglophile emir settled on the throne
and could make a treaty with him, then it would be the merest
professional obstinacy, an aspect of the <squote>K.C.B. mania</squote>, to
collect a large force on the Indian frontier. Having manufactured the
situation, Lytton would manage with the smallest force possible.
After 23 September, therefore, he pushed forward his preparations,
stationed troops in the cantonments of Thal, Sukkur and Peshawar and
watched for the flight and departure of the emir. He prepared, in the
last week of September, to issue a proclamation calling on the Afghan
people to rise against the enemy of the Indian government: but was
restrained because the Cabinet regarded this as tantamount to a
declaration of war. He felt that he should send a force to the
assistance of the Khyber tribesmen who helped to escort Chamberlain's
mission. The Cabinet made it clear that he must not advance beyond
Ali Musjid because that too would seem to imply war. But he did not,
at any time during September or October, cease to hope that Sher Ali
might fall spontaneously by the mere expression of Lytton's disfavour.
From Kabul, however, there was no sign of weakness: the emir remained
firm and unpoisoned; and he replied unhelpfully and (it seemed to
Lytton's orientalists) insolently to Lytton's letter of 14 September.

<text id=LOBJ60>
   <p>The fact that he is not in possession of the details probably
explains why his confidence in technique is so unbounded. There is
even more of the mystic than of the intellectual in the young
Val&eacute;ry. No wonder that at this stage he more or less gives up the
writing of poetry. Literature is <quote>l'art de se jouer de l'&acirc;me des
autres</quote>; by his own definition, poetry is not now for him the
attempt to give expression to something in himself (however
deliberately or consciously); the poet gets to know his material
(language, poetry), the nature of the public (human psychology in
relation to art), and then, like \da Vinci, having discovered the
<quote>relations... entre des choses dont nous &eacute;chappe la loi de
continuit&eacute;</quote>, he can, at will, produce whatever effects he
desires to produce in the reader. There is only one thing missing in
this ideal scheme: a desire on the part of the poet to produce any
effect at all. What would be the point? <quote>Le g&eacute;nie est
facile.</quote> <quote>Facil cosa e farsi universale.</quote> The young
Val&eacute;ry has more important things to do: he wants to follow up his
programme of knowledge and self-knowledge (among other things, to
fathom art and psychology, the complete knowledge of which is presumed
in the \da Vinci and the Monsieur Teste created by him). The art of
poetry as defined by Val&eacute;ry is no longer of any interest from the
creative point of view. It demands a <quote>certain sacrifice de
l'intellect</quote>, chiefly because he would, if he went on composing
poetry, be simply giving to any public for which he wrote what he
knows would affect it, playing a rather inferior game which, in
theory, he knows he could not lose. The implicit reasoning is
somewhat circular. If he were a \da Vinci or a Monsieur Teste, he
would not trouble himself with poetic composition. So he abandons it.
But he is not yet, in fact, a \da Vinci or a Monsieur Teste, so he
will devote all his time and energy to becoming a universal mind.
   <p>Such, in outline, and with only a little simplification, is the
theory of the young Val&eacute;ry concerning inspiration and technique.
It is clear that he has not yet formulated clear distinctions between
<squote>total inspiration</squote> and the forms we have called <squote>intermittent</squote>,
<squote>intuitive</squote>, <squote>exalted</squote> and <squote>personal</squote>; but he rejects them by
implication. <squote>Attributed inspiration</squote> would presumably, it is
true, have been accepted by him. But the other five forms he would
have rejected: his theory allows them to be completely dispensed with.
   <p>But is his theory convincing? Let us consider the first of the
two conceptions of creation implicit in the Technique
litt&eacute;raire article, according to which the poet has something in
himself, impression, dream or thought, which he must communicate by
controlled technique. Whilst surely nearer the truth than the other,
the theory that works backwards, even this conception seems
mechanistic, too simple and unsatisfactory. Val&eacute;ry does not
examine how impression, dream or thought originate. There is no
mention of any possible dynamism behind them, no mention of the fact
that the initial impetus may be accompanied by emotion or excitement
which are commonly envisaged as attributes of inspiration. It may be
conceded that poetry is certainly the communication of something, and
that accordingly it is sound to claim that the poet is concerned with
an audience, so that the more knowledge he has of this audience and of
the nature of his art, the better. But it is surely not simply a
question, in poetic creation, of the poet's having something clearly
formed in his mind, even something so vague as a dream, and then
transferring it to a reader by the technique of language. The truth
surely is (and the mature Val&eacute;ry certainly subscribed to this view)
that the poet is concerned with clarifying and making enjoyably
articulate for himself and the reader something within him which does
not exist as poetry until the poem is composed. Given the nature of
language and poetic creation, the poet is, to a certain extent,
discovering what he has to say, or rather, what he can say, as he
composes the poem. The poem is a kind of compromise between what the
poet wanted to say initially (and this phrase <squote>what the poet wanted
to say</squote> is perhaps too rational and explicit to describe what for
many poets is vague and more anticipation than exact intention at this
stage), what he finds to say, and all the new things to express which
occur to him as he actually composes the poem. All these aspects of
poetic creation will indeed be admirably brought out by the mature
Val&eacute;ry. Louis MacNeice writes of that <quote>dialect of purification</quote>
whereby a poem is produced,

<quote>
   <p>a poem which is neither the experience nor the memory, nor an
abstract dance of words, but a new life composite of all three.
<QUOTE/>

   <p>In this respect, then, poetry can be considered as a kind of
knowledge, of self-knowledge particularly, only to be found during the
struggle to compose. Val&eacute;ry in his youth does not show much
awareness of these aspects of poetic creation and of this kind of
self-knowledge. He is obsessed with the notion of art as
communication, and therefore with the fact that, though the poet may
be able to make the reader react as he wishes by his all-conquering
technique, he is nevertheless, because he indulges in poetic
composition, a slave to the reader and to language:

   <p>We are thus led on to the second theory of poetry revealed with
some uncertainty in the Technique litt&eacute;raire article and
unequivocally expounded towards the end of the Introduction &agrave; la
m&eacute;thode de L&eacute;onard de Vinci, the theory according to which
the poet works backwards from the reader. This stands condemned on
two counts. Firstly, it is a partial view of poetic creation,
neglecting the personal contribution which the poet can, must, make
(i.e. <squote>personal inspiration</squote>; and this is not to mention the
importance of <squote>intermittent</squote>, <squote>intuitive</squote> and <squote>exalted
inspiration</squote>). Val&eacute;ry is at least consistent: having defined the
work of art as <quote>une machine destin&eacute;e &agrave; exciter et &agrave;
combiner les formations individuelles de ces esprits</quote> (the public),
he rejects such an activity as beneath him, as time-wasting when he
has more important things to do. His initial definition of art is
faulty, incomplete. Secondly, it stands condemned by the very
inadequacy of its presentation. Not only is art ill defined, but no
details are given of the nature of human psychology on which the
success of the triumphant technique is supposed to depend. The fact
is that, at this stage of his career, he has no adequate theory of
language and no adequate conception of poetic creation such as he will
have in later years. Few would question the value of technique, but
how many would subscribe to the exaggerated thesis put forward by
Val&eacute;ry in his youth?
   <p>
   <p>Nothing is more significant than the detached humour with which
Val&eacute;ry, in 1919, in the Note et Digression which he wrote for
his Introduction &agrave; la m&eacute;thode de L&eacute;onard de Vinci,
looks back, not without sympathy despite the detachment, at the
ideas and difficulties which he had had in 1894, about the time of
composition of the \Introduction. He excuses himself, so to
speak, but does not really explain enough for our purposes. We are
still left wondering why he should have had this absolute faith in the
powers of technique and why therefore he believed, if only for a short
time, that poetry can be composed without any trace of inspiration.
The influence of Poe and Mallarm&eacute;, and the part it played in
Val&eacute;ry's abandonment of poetry and the development of his programme
of knowledge and self-knowledge, has been clearly indicated by
Val&eacute;ry himself and often discussed by his critics. Less attention
has been paid to an influence probably no less potent: that of
contemporary scientific thought.
   <p>The last three decades of the nineteenth century were an age in
which, as the rift between philosophy and science widened, it was
becoming evident that there was more than one reality, depending on
the viewpoint of the observer. The scientist was cautious of claiming
to interpret or explain phenomena: on the one hand, there was reality
with its multiple facets, on the other, the man who sought to
understand this reality. His understanding was necessarily
subjective, but hope lay in his attempt to capture the manifold
aspects of this reality. In fact, reality as such had no meaning: it
is we who supply the meaning. The upshot of these tendencies of
enlightened positivism was that the scientist avoided any metaphysical
claims for his discoveries (similarly, Val&eacute;ry had rejected
philosophy, metaphysics, any form of <squote>absolute</squote> in the normal
sense): he sought a limited goal, continuity, by establishing
relationships between phenomena.
   <p>Henri Poincar&eacute; probably played a decisive r&ocirc;le in causing
Val&eacute;ry to shift his attention <quote>from <squote>objects in themselves</squote> to
the <squote>relationships existing between objects</squote>, in which alone is any
meaning to be found.</quote> Thanks to his purely personal preoccupations
(his cult of consciousness, together with his reaction against love
and poetry, <quote>les choses vagues</quote> generally), thanks to the
influence of Mallarm&eacute;'s formalism, Val&eacute;ry was already by the
early 1890s well along the road of <squote>relations</squote> as opposed to
<squote>objects in themselves</squote>. Marked similarities of attitude can be
discovered between the views of Poincar&eacute; and Val&eacute;ry on
intellectual creation, both poetic and scientific. Val&eacute;ry writes
in 1919:

<quote>
   <p>~Toutes choses se substituent, &mdash; ne serait-ce pas la
d&eacute;finition des choses?
<QUOTE/>

   <p>and, in 1944, looking back to his youth:

   <p>The young Val&eacute;ry is interested in the <quote>esprit universel</quote>,
\da Vinci or Napoleon, whose supreme secret

<quote>
   <p>est et ne peut &ecirc;tre que dans les relations qu'ils
trouv&egrave;rent,  &mdash; qu'ils furent forc&eacute;s de trouver, &mdash; entre des
choses dont nous &eacute;chappe la loi de continuit&eacute;.
<QUOTE/>

   <p>Val&eacute;ry is drawn by the rigour and the universality of
mathematics and of positivistic science generally towards the end of
the nineteenth century. His \da Vinci of the \Introduction, his
Monsieur Teste, are animated by a central belief in the \continu;
his attitude before 1900, and even long after that date, like that
of Poincar&eacute;, rests on the postulate that we cannot yet explain all
the relations between all phenomena, but that we shall be able to do
so eventually. The \da Vinci of the \Introduction believes that
our inability to see everything minutely and clearly is due merely to
the infirmity of our senses; such was Clerk Maxwell's point of view,
as exemplified by his imaginary demon who could perform various
fantastic tasks beyond the powers of ordinary men. The function of
the universal mind is to transform \discontinu into \continu,
and there is a tacit assumption that if this process can be
continued, all the elements which do not fit in with what we already
know, all the \discontinu, past, present or future, will be
transformed into \continu. Maxwell's demon is essentially the
same monster as Val&eacute;ry's \da Vinci &mdash; a projection to the infinite
of their positivistic belief in \rapports and the possibility of
explaining the relationships between everything. Maxwell's demon and
Val&eacute;ry's \da Vinci (or Teste) are what Poincar&eacute;, Maxwell and
Val&eacute;ry wanted to be, hoped to be &mdash; the universal mind. This
Maxwell-Poincar&eacute;-Val&eacute;ry relationship becomes all the more
understandable if we remember that Poincar&eacute;, naturally, was well
acquainted with the work of Maxwell, and Val&eacute;ry acquainted with the
work of both Poincar&eacute; and Maxwell.
   <p>So we see how Val&eacute;ry came to transfer his interests and hopes
from poetic creation to this positivistic ideal of universal
knowledge. With a youthful enthusiasm and impatience which he later
acknowledged in the Note et Digression of 1919, he fathoms, as
he thinks, <quote>le probl&egrave;me litt&eacute;raire</quote> in the way we have
seen, and more or less abandons poetic composition:

Poe and Mallarm&eacute; had, in a sense, led him in the same direction as
Poincar&eacute;. He is strong in his belief that there is

une sorte de contraste entre l'exercice de la litt&eacute;rature et la
poursuite d'une certaine rigueur et d'une enti&egrave;re sinc&eacute;rit&eacute;
de la pens&eacute;e.
<QUOTE/>


<text id=LOBJ61>
   <p>This is also where we get the stage-villain's hiss of ~<quote>Die he
or Justice must</quote>. God is much at his worst here, in his first
appearance; but he needs to be, to make the offer of the Son produce a
dramatic change. I do not know what to make of his expressing the
Calvinist doctrine that the elect are chosen by his will alone, which
Milton had appeared to reject (185); it has a peculiar impact here,
when God has not yet even secured the Fall of Adam and Eve. One might
argue that he was in no mood to make jokes; and besides, the effect
here is not a sardonic mockery of Satan, which can be felt in the
military joke readily enough, but a mysterious and deeply rooted sense
of glory. A simple explanation may be put forward; Milton felt that
this was such a tricky bit to put over his audience, because the
inherent contradictions were coming so very near the surface, that he
needed with a secret delight to call on the whole of his power. This
is almost what Shelley took to be his frame of mind; and it is hard to
accept, with the De Doctrina before us, without talking about
Milton's Unconsciousness. But we may be sure that there is a
mediating factor; if he had been challenged about the passage, he
would have said that he was following the Old Testament scrupulously,
and allowing God to mock his foes.
   <p>This has often been said about the jokes of Milton's God, or at
least about the one which can't be ignored because it is explained as
a joke (5.720); and one can make a rough check from the Concordance
at the end of a Bible. The only important case is from Psalm 2;
here again we meet the ancient document in which the King of Zion is
adopted as the Son of God:

<quote>
   <p>Why do the heathen rage ... ? The kings of the earth set
themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord,
and against his anointed&hellip;.. He that sitteth in the heavens shall
laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.
<QUOTE/>

   <p>This is echoed in Psalms 37.13 and 59.8, and perhaps in
Proverbs 1.26, where Wisdom and not God mocks the worldly rather
than a powerful aggressor; but after trying to look under all the
relevant words I do not find that the Concordance ever ascribes the
sentiment to the Prophets. It was thus an ancient tradition but one
treated with reserve, as Milton would understand. Naturally his
intention in putting so much weight on it has been found especially
hard to grasp.
   <p>The views of M. Morand about the divine characters have been
neglected and seem to me illuminating. In the same year as De
Comus A Satan he published a pamphlet in English, The Effects of
his Political Life on John Milton, concerned to show that a certain
worldly-mindedness entered Milton's later poetry as a result of his
rather sordid experience of government, politics, and propaganda.
What chiefly stands out in this lively work, I think, is an
accusation that Milton himself had smuggled into a later edition of
Eikon Basilike the prayer, derived from Sidney's Arcadia,
for which he then so resoundingly denounced King Charles in
Eikonoclastes; we are given a shocking picture of an English
expert getting the evidence of a Dutch researcher ignored by
gentlemanly bluff. Mr Robert Graves used the main story in Wife
to Mr Milton, but I had not realized that the evidence for it was
so strong; indeed, Mr Graves often seems too disgusted by Milton to
be convincing &mdash; disagreeable in many ways he may have been, but surely
not a physical coward. I don't feel that the action is too bad for
Milton; he would think the divine purpose behind the Civil War
justified propaganda tricks, and need not have thought this a
particularly bad one. The King was dead, and the purpose of the cheat
was merely to prevent the people from thinking him a martyr. He
hadn't written any of the book really, and Milton suspected that at
the time, so it was only a matter of answering one cheat with another.
Milton must in any case have been insincere in pretending to be
shocked at the use of a prayer by Sidney, given in the story as that
of a pagan, but so Christian in feeling as to be out of period (it
assumes that God may be sending us evil as a test or tonic for our
characters, which even if to be found in Aeschylus or Marcus Aurelius
is not standard for Arcadia). Milton might comfort himself with the
reflection that he wasn't even damaging the man's character in the
eyes of fit judges, only making use of a popular superstition &mdash; as
Shelley expected on another occasion. However, M. Morand finds that
this kind of activity brought about a Fallen condition, as one might
say, in the mind of the poet, and such is what De Comus A Satan
examines throughout the later poetry.
   <p>There is an assumption here that to do Government propaganda can
only have a bad effect upon a poet's mind, and I feel able to speak on
the point as I was employed at such work myself in the Second World
War, indeed once had the honour of being named in rebuttal by
Fritzsche himself and called a curly-headed Jew. I wasn't in on any
of the splendid tricks, such as Milton is accused of, but the
cooked-up argufying I have experienced. To work at it forces you to
imagine all the time what the enemy will reply; you are trying to get
him into a corner. Such a training cannot narrow a man's
understanding of other people's opinions, though it may well narrow
his own opinions. I should say that Milton's experience of propaganda
is what makes his later poetry so very dramatic; that is, though he is
a furious partisan, he can always imagine with all its force exactly
what the reply of the opponent would be. As to his integrity, he was
such an inconvenient propagandist that the Government deserve credit
for having the nerve to appoint and retain him. He had already
published the Divorce Pamphlets before he got the job; well now, if
you are setting out to be severe and revolutionary on the basis of
literal acceptance of the Old Testament, the most embarrassing thing
you can be confronted with is detailed evidence about the sexual
habits of the patriarchs; it is the one point where the plain man
feels he can laugh. Milton always remained liable to defend his side
by an argument which would strike his employers as damaging; his style
of attack is savagely whole-hearted, but his depth of historical
knowledge and imaginative sympathy keep having unexpected effects. He
was not at all likely to feel that he had forfeited his independence
of mind by such work. M. Morand therefore strikes me as rather
innocent in assuming that he was corrupted by it, but I warmly agree
that it made his mind very political. Professor Wilson Knight has
also remarked that Milton wrote a political allegory under the
appearance of a religious poem, though he did not draw such drastic
consequences from the epigram.
   <p>On the Morand view, God is simply a dynastic ruler like those
Milton had had to deal with; Cromwell had wanted his son to inherit,
no less than Charles. M. Morand does not seem to realize it, but
the effect is to make Milton's God much better. His intrigues and
lies to bolster his power are now comparatively unselfish, being only
meant to transfer it unimpaired to his Son, and above all he feels no
malignity towards his victims. His method of impressing the loyalist
angels will doom almost all mankind to misery, but he takes no
pleasure in that; it simply does not bother him. The hypocrisy which
the jovial old ruffian feels to be required of him in public has not
poisoned his own mind, as we realize when he permits himself his
leering jokes. This does, I should say, correspond to the impression
usually made by the poem on a person not brought up as a Christian,
such as my Chinese and Japanese students. The next step is to regard
the debate in Heaven, where the Son, but no angel, offers to die for
man, as a political trick rigged up to impress the surviving angels;
the Son is free to remark (3.245) that he knows the Father won't
let him stay dead, so that the incantationary repetition of the word
death comes to seem blatantly artificial. (We find in the De
Doctrina Chapter 12 that Milton includes <quote>under the head of
death, in Scripture, all evils whatsoever</quote>...). Nobody is surprised
at the absence of volunteers among the good angels, whereas Satan,
during the parallel scene in Hell (2.470), has to close the debate
hurriedly for fear a less competent rebel put himself forward.
Otherwise the two scenes are deliberately made alike, and the reason
is simply that both are political:

<quote>
   <p>Ce qui frappe, c'est le parallelisme des moyens employ&eacute;es,
conseils, discours. M&ecirc;me souci de garder pour soi tout gloire.
<QUOTE/>
(p. 145)

   <p>On reaching Paradise Regained, M. Morand is interested to
learn how the Son grew up. In Paradise Lost he often seems half
ashamed of the autocratic behaviour of his Father, because his role is
to induce the subject angels to endure it; but when he is alone on the
earth-visit which has been arranged for him we find he has merely the
cold calculating pride which we would expect from his training.
However, we already find this trait, decides M. Morand, at the
early public moment when he offers his Sacrifice; he is unable to
avoid presenting himself as solely interested in his own career (p.
169). As the Creation for which he was the instrument has already
happened, he might at least speak as if he could tell a man apart from
a cow, but he says that his Father's grace visits <quote>all his
creatures</quote> (3.230). Satan, on the parallel occasion, was at
least genuinely concerned to get the job done, whoever did it; and
M. Morand decides that the ringing repetition of ME in the speech
of sacrifice of the Son is a little too grotesque, however perfectly
in character. Milton

<quote>
   <p>n'e&ucirc;t pas pens&eacute; &agrave; ce que peut contenir de ridicule ce
martellement du moi.

modestie est encore Satan.
<QUOTE/>
(p. 171)

   <p>This is at least a splendid reply to the argument that pride is
the basic fault of all the characters who fall.
   <p>The Morand line of argument can be taken an extra step, to argue
that the Son too is being cheated by the Father; and this excites a
suspicion that there is something inadequate about it. He says
nothing of the means of his death, and speaks as if he is going to
remain on earth till the Last Day:

   <p>Our chief impression here, surely, is not that he is too little
interested in mankind but that he does not know what is going to
happen, except for a triumph at which he can rejoice. If the Jews had
not chosen to kill him, he would presumably have remained on earth
till the Last Day, making history less bad than the poem describes it
as being; and what they will choose can be foreknown by the Father
only. The Son expects to find no frown upon the face of God on
Judgement Day, the Dies Irae itself, so we can hardly doubt
that he expects things to turn out better than they do. His prophecy
appears to be a continuous narrative: <quote>not long lie... rise
victorious... then... then</quote>, as if he will lead the blessed to
Heaven very soon after the Resurrection. Among human speakers
<squote>lastly die</squote> is a natural way to express pathos, though a
tautology; but a meaning which would make it a correct description of
the career of the Son is hard to invent.

<text id=LOBJ62>
The wife, in this story, was dead and buried and yet her husband
found her <squote>in magno feminarum cetu de nocte</squote> and snatched her
away and brought her back home to human life once more. Whether this
old Breton tale had already been contaminated with the classical
legend of Orpheus and Eurydice we cannot say, but the strange
oscillation between contrary concepts is characteristic of Orfeo
as well.
   <p>The motive for abduction in fairy tales is usually love, as, for
example, in Guingamor, Lanval and Graelent; but Heurodis was
not snatched away for love; the fairy king had his own queen; besides,
to have introduced the love motive in this fashion would have cut
across the theme of marital love and loyalty upon which the tale of
Orpheus and Eurydice hinges. If the king of Fairy is not to be
entirely identified with the king of the Dead, what reason can be
offered for his behaviour?
   <p>It is at this point, when Orfeo saw his wife lying under the
ympe tre in the castle courtyard, that the interlacing of the
classical and Celtic stories appears at its most intricate.
   <p>Heurodis was abducted in the <squote>&infin;e comessing of May</squote>.
In a vague, imperceptible way, the fairy king, who was also the god
of an underworld, since Orfeo had to go <squote>In at a roche</squote> to
reach him, seems here to have taken on some of the attributes of Dis,
who stole Proserpina away as she was gathering spring flowers in the
meadow; and Heurodis also seems to take the place of Proserpina, for
Eurydice was not abducted, but killed by the poisonous fangs of a
snake. In classical legend, Dis or Pluto was the king of the
underworld and the dead; but, according to Caesar, the Celts also had
a god of the underworld similar to Dis, from whom all the Gauls
claimed to be descended: ~<squote>Galli se omnes ab Dite patre prognatos
praedicant</squote>, and in later fairy lore he or the classical Dis or
both became identified with the king of Fairy, if Chaucer is to be
believed: <squote>Pluto that is the kyng of fairye</squote> (Merchant's
Tale, 983). Again, in the classical legend, the two attributes of
Dis fell together; he was not only the power of winter in seasonal
myth, he was also the god of Hades, the ruler in the kingdom of the
Dead. In Celtic legend also, there existed a seasonal myth similar to
that of Dis and Proserpina; it took the form of an abduction story,
closely resembling the abduction of Heurodis in some of the details to
which the classical versions offer no similarity. Traces of this myth
are to be found in Culhwch and Olwen and the Vita Gildae,
said to have been written by Caradoc of Llancarvon:
<quote>
   <p>(a) Creiddylad daughter of Lludd Silver-hand (the maiden of
most majesty that was ever in the Island of Britain and its three
adjacent islands). And for her Gwythyr son of Greidawl and Gwyn son
of Nudd fight for ever each May-calends till the day of doom...
   <p>Creiddylad daughter of Lludd Silver-hand went with Gwythyr son of
Greidawl; and before he had slept with her there came Gwyn son of Nudd
and carried her off by force. Gwythyr son of Greidawl gathered a host
and he came to fight with Gwyn son of Nudd. And Gwyn prevailed...
Arthur heard tell of this and he came into the North and summoned to
him Gwyn son of Nudd and set free his noblemen from his prison and
peace was made between Gwyn son of Nudd and Gwythyr son of Greidawl.
This is the peace that was made: the maiden should remain in her
father's house unmolested by either side, and there should be battle
between Gwyn and Gwythyr each May-calends for ever and ever, from that
day till doomsday; and the one of them that should be victor on
doomsday, let him have the maiden.
<QUOTE/>

   <p>The details worth noting in relation to Orfeo are: the
abduction had reference to the May-calends or <squote>&infin;e comessing of
May</squote> in (a) and there is an implication of seasonal cycle in
<squote>per unius anni circulum</squote> in (b); the husband was a king
and the stolen wife a queen in (b); the ravisher was also a king
in both (a) and (b), but whereas in Culhwch and Olwen he
was undoubtedly the king of the underworld, Gwyn \ap Nudd, king of
Annwn, Melvas was made king of the <squote>summer region</squote> or Somerset,
since it was to his castle in Glastonbury that he carried the queen.
Possibly the roles of Arthur and Melvas have been exchanged, for
Gwythyr \ap Greidawl seems to be equated with the sun or summer, if
the elements in his name are any guide, Gwythyr, Victor and
Greid-, Old Irish \?&symbol;greid, to scorch. Melvas ought to be
the equivalent of Gwyn \ap Nudd. However, as the version in the
Vita Gildae was obviously altered to boost Glastonbury abbey
and Gildas, these differences may be bits of local colour. Finally,
in both (a) and (b), an attempt was made to recapture the
woman with the help of armed knights, and in (b) Guinevere was
restored to her husband just as Heurodis was given back to Orfeo.
   <p>Why Orfeo was a <squote>king</squote> might now appear to be more reasonable;
and the fact that he was successful in bringing his wife safely out of
Fairyland becomes something more than a mere romantic and neo-fairy
ending to an old, tragic story. Yet, to understand Orfeo
completely, we must turn again to the classical tale of Orpheus and
Eurydice, for it is this alone which can explain why Heurodis was
abducted for no apparent reason. Eurydice, like the dead mother in
the Breton tale, Filii Mortue, was the beloved wife who died;
Heurodis, her nominal counterpart, was at the same time
semi-Proserpina, semi-Creiddylad-Guinevere, and was abducted; the
reason for her abduction is omitted because, as Eurydice, she should
have died, and, as Proserpina-Creiddylad-Guinevere, she should have
been stolen for love; either reason is incompatible with the theme of
Orfeo.
   <p>When Orfeo arrived in the fairy underworld, he saw his queen,
not in the palace among the ladies with whom he had met her in the
forest, but in the outer courtyard, among a collection of sick, mad,
crippled and headless people, who were lying there exactly as they had
been on earth when they had been snatched away in their noontide
sleep. In the forest she had been <squote>alive</squote>; she had recognized him
and had wept; yet, when he followed the fairy company and came to find
her in Fairyland, she is pictured as being in her first condition, not
as she was the day she was abducted, for then she was not asleep, but
as she was when the fairy king first appeared to her &mdash; asleep under
the ympe tre.
   <p>The poet says that all the people who were lying there, and
that includes Heurodis, <squote>&infin;ou&symbol;t dede and nare nou&symbol;t</squote>.
Even when full allowance has been made for the marvellous things
which could happen in Fairyland, it is difficult to believe that a
person without a head was not <squote>dead</squote> in the first instance. And
are we to understand that these headless, armless, burnt and choked
people, to say nothing of the mothers in childbed, also <squote>arose</squote> as
Heurodis evidently did, and took part in the dancing and hunting in
the forest? Analysis of this kind emphasizes the slight
inconsistencies in the narrative and serves to show up the seams in
the joining of the Celtic and classical tales. At the same time, we
can scour Georgics, 4 and Metamorphoses, 10 in vain for
any hint or detail which might help to throw light on this odd
picture. The bodiless phantoms that came in their thousands from the
depths of Erebus at the sound of Orpheus's lyre (Georgics, 4,
475-7) and the bloodless spirits who wept at the strain
(Metamorphoses, 10, 41) cannot honestly be considered as in any
way comparable to the folk <squote>liggeand wi&infin;in &infin;e wal</squote>, for
Orfeo had not yet entered the king's palace nor had he touched the
strings of his harp nor did these people outside come in later on to
listen to him.
   <p>If it be remembered that not only the legend of Orpheus, but the
whole of Virgil's work was widely known in the Middle Ages, a clue may
be found in another Virgilian description of the classical underworld,
the one in Aeneid, Bk. 6.
   <p>Aeneas, when he prayed to be allowed to visit his father's shade
in Hades, made use of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice to strengthen
his petition; if Orpheus could call up his wife's shade in Erebus,
could not he, Aeneas, also a descendant of the gods, make the same
journey? He was allowed to do so and when he reached the entrance to
Hades he is pictured as approaching it across the \vestibulum or
forecourt, with the \limen and \fores, the main door, at the
far side; that is, Virgil has imagined the entrance to Hades in
contemporary terms, those of the Roman house, just as the poet of
Orfeo has visualized the entrance to the fairy underworld in terms
of a medieval castle:

   <p>What Aeneas saw in the forecourt of Orcus was very similar to
that which Orfeo saw in the courtyard of the fairy king's castle; all
kinds of horrors had <squote>made their beds</squote> there, but where Virgil has
enumerated abstractions and the customary grisly inhabitants of
Tartarus, the author of Orfeo has presented a picture of examples,
an oddly assorted gathering of people, most of whom would have been
found, in the Middle Ages, in Purgatory, because they had died
suddenly and unshriven &mdash; the burnt, the drowned, women who had died
mad in labour, soldiers killed in battle and those who, like Hamlet's
father, had been taken, <squote>grossly, full of bread</squote> and had died
choking. None of them has a right to a home in Fairyland, at least,
not according to the ancient tradition concerning that place; all who
go there are either stolen or lured from earth on account of their
beauty or desirability. That Heurodis should be there is
intelligible, but the rest seem to belong to the Christian otherworld
of punishment, which, in the Middle Ages, owed many of its features to
the pagan conception of Tartarus; both were places in which the wicked
or the unassoiled found themselves after death and every traveller who
had the temerity to visit them, were he an Orpheus, an Aeneas or a
Knight Owen had his sight seared with visions of human agony. Orpheus
descended into Hades, Orfeo tunnelled into Fairyland; the two stories
which are so successfully merged in other parts of Orfeo are just
here a little divergent, or perhaps it is that the classical element
is for the moment uppermost and has, in its detail, been partly
overlaid with contemporary notions. In any case, the similarity
between the settings is very close.
   <p>Another interesting point of comparison lies in the linking of
sleep with the idea of Death's kingdom. Virgil has used the word
\sopor, which has an intensive force, implying a torpor akin to
the sleep of death, <squote>consanguineus Leti Sopor</squote>. Sleep, in
classical legend, was associated with Hades. According to Hesiod
(Theogony, 1, 211 ff.), Erebus and Night were the children
of Chaos; and Night, the mother of Doom, Fate and Death, also gave
birth to Sleep and the tribe of Dreams and <squote>painful Woe</squote>. Cicero
echoes this in his De Natura Deorum, 3, 17: <squote>Amor Dolus
Metus... Mors Tenebrae Miseria... Somnia quos omnes Erebo et Nocte
natos ferunt</squote>. In Orfeo the same idea is present, for, in the
fairy otherworld, which is also an underworld, the miseries,
exemplified by the folk <squote>liggeand wi&infin;in &infin;e wal</squote>, are
definitely related to sleep: <squote>ri&infin;t as &infin;ai slepe her
vndertides</squote>.
   <p>Next, there is the tree, the great Elm of Dreams. No true
parallel to it has yet been found in classical legend.

<text id=LOBJ63>
For Hardy, then, Correggio is the artist of yearning, as, indeed,
he himself tells us in A Pair of Blue Eyes in the passage
describing the appearance of Elfride Swancourt, where he extends his
method and sees his heroine through the eyes of three painters,
Raphael, Rubens, and Correggio, in turn:
<quote>
   <p>Elfride had as her own the thoughtfulness which appears in the
Madonna \della Sedia, without its rapture: the warmth and spirit of
the type of woman's feature most common to the beauties &mdash; mortal and
immortal &mdash; of Rubens, without their insistent fleshiness. The
characteristic expression of the female faces of Correggio &mdash; that of
the yearning human thoughts that lie too deep for tears &mdash; was hers
sometimes, but seldom under ordinary conditions.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>This is the most elaborate of all Hardy's experiments in what
might be called pictorial definition. It will be observed that in all
the examples that I have given he seizes upon some quality that is
peculiarly characteristic of the artist in question, so that the
reader at once receives an impression of a general facial type before
being invited to consider its particular manifestation. With quite
subsidiary characters, however, a mere impression is sufficient, and
no qualifications are added: thus the woman who opens the lodge gate
at Endelstow, in A Pair of Blue Eyes, is simply described as
having <squote>a double chin and thick neck, like the Queen Anne portrait by
Dahl</squote> &mdash; and although the incident has no importance in the story
there is point in the choice of a painter who seems to have had no
qualms about stressing the plainness and stodginess of his sitters.
   <p>Even the nationality of the artist alluded to contributes to our
impression of the character whom Hardy is presenting. If Cytherea
Graye could have been painted by Greuze, or Lucetta Templeman by
Titian, Liddy Smallbury, Bathsheba's servant in Far From the Madding
Crowd, suggests rather the healthy, well-scrubbed girls of Dutch
art:
<quote>
   <p>~The beauty her features might have lacked in form was amply made
up for by perfection of hue, which at this winter-time was the
softened ruddiness on a surface of high rotundity that we meet with in
a Terburg or a Gerard Douw;
<QUOTE/>
   <p>while Sue Bridehead, with her dark beauty, conjures up in Jude's
mind a recollection of <squote>the girls he had seen in engravings from
paintings of the Spanish School</squote>.
   <p>An effective use of this device of pictorial allusion to suggest
the attitude of a character at a particular moment is to be found in
the glimpse of Mr. Penny at work at his trade, in Under the
Greenwood Tree. Mr. Penny is a shoemaker, and his house looks out
on to the main road, <squote>Mr. Penny himself being invariably seen
working inside like a framed portrait of a shoemaker by some modern
Moroni</squote>. Although this is not a reference to an actual picture by
Moroni (and no painting of a shoemaker by Moroni exists), the effect
is still precise, for we know what such a picture by a
nineteenth-century Moroni would look like. Moroni, we know,
specialized in single portraits in which he emphasized his sitter's
trade or calling, as in the <squote>Portrait of a Tailor</squote> in the National
Gallery, which was probably the picture by which Hardy knew him best;
and it was clearly Moroni's practice of putting a frame, as it were,
around a single figure, and of isolating him in the context of his
daily work, that Hardy found interesting.
   <p>Many of the artists who fascinated Hardy were not particularly
fashionable in his own day; and names of some of them would have been
known to a mere handful of his readers. A curious example of his
tastes is provided by his two allusions, first in The Return of the
Native, and then in Tess of the D'Urbervilles, to Sallaert and
Van Alsloot, artists in whom only recently much interest has been
taken, and then mainly by specialists. Both worked in Brussels in the
early years of the seventeenth century, devoting themselves chiefly to
a class of processional scene crowded with tiny figures. Among the
best known of these are the two pictures by Van Alsloot in the
Victoria and Albert Museum representing the annual procession in
Brussels known as the Ommeganck, which was held under the patronage of
the church of Notre Dame \de Sablon, a church founded by the Guild of
Crossbowmen. The object of the procession was to commemorate the
translation to this church, from Antwerp, of a miraculous image of the
Virgin, and it was preceded by the ceremony of the Shooting of the
Popinjay (a wooden representation of a parrot fixed to the top of a
steeple). Van Alsloot's pictures record the Ommeganck of 1615, when
the Infanta Isabella, the consort of the Archduke Albert, had
succeeded in shooting the popinjay at the first attempt. The
Ommeganck was an extremely colourful affair, dominated as it was by
the triumphal cars carrying elaborate enactments of tableaux of
such scenes as the Nativity and St. George's fight with the Dragon.
And dotted all over Van Alsloot's representations of it are the
quaint little figures that seem above all else to have caught Hardy's
fancy. Hardy first alludes to them in The Return of the Native:
<quote>
   <p>What was the great world to Mrs. Yeobright? A multitude whose
tendencies could be perceived, though not its essences. Communities
were seen by her as from a distance; she saw them as we see the
throngs which cover the canvases of Sallaert, Van Alsloot, and others
of that school &mdash; vast masses of beings, jostling, zigzagging, and
processioning in definite directions, but whose features are
indistinguishable by the very comprehensiveness of the view.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>In Tess of the D'Urbervilles, published thirteen years later,
it is a large herd of cows that brings these processional pictures
before Hardy's eyes:
<quote>
   <p>The green lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by
Van Alsloot or Sallaert with burghers. The ripe hue of the red and
dun kine absorbed the evening sunlight, which the white-coated
animals returned to the eye in rays almost as dazzling.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>It may be added that this passage has a further interest, for it
suggests that Hardy was aware of the colour-theories of men like Rood
and Chevreul, which were to have some influence on Impressionism. We
may compare a similar but much earlier observation upon the nature of
colour in Far From the Madding Crowd (published in 1873): <squote>We
learn that it is not the rays which bodies absorb, but those which
they reject, that give them the colours they are known by.</squote>
   <p>If Hardy could scarcely have assumed in the generality of his
readers any knowledge of Sallaert or Van Alsloot, he could presumably
have counted upon a much wider familiarity with the white horses which
almost invariably appear in the landscapes of Wouwermans, always a
popular artist in England, and which are alluded to in the scene in
The Woodlanders where Grace Melbury watches her husband,
Fitzpiers, who is being unfaithful to her, riding away on a white
horse named Darling to his assignation with Mrs. Charmond:
<quote>
   <p>He kept along the edge of this high, uninclosed country, and the
sky behind him being deep violet he could still see white Darling in
relief upon it &mdash; a mere speck now &mdash; a Wouwermans eccentricity reduced
to microscopic dimensions. Upon this high ground he gradually
disappeared.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>Equally effective is the description, in the same novel, of a
freshly pressed tablecloth &mdash; <squote>reticulated with folds as in Flemish
Last Suppers</squote> &mdash; or of the clear outlines of figures thrown into
relief by the light of a bonfire, in The Return of the Native:
<quote>
   <p>The brilliant lights and sooty shades which struggled upon the
skin and clothes of the persons standing round caused their lineaments
and general contours to be drawn with Dureresque vigour and dash.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>And, if poets and novelists have strained themselves to say
something original about the moon, only Hardy could have likened it,
as he does in Tess, to <squote>the outworn gold-leaf halo of some
worm-eaten Tuscan saint</squote>.
   <p>As Hardy develops as a writer it is interesting to observe the
growing maturation of this device of pictorial allusion, which in his
hands becomes a unique skill. In the later novels he is able to
employ it in ways that go far beyond a purely descriptive intention.
Towards the end of Tess, he wishes to suggest the psychological
change which has been brought about in Angel Clare by his wife's
confession, and he puts it thus:
<quote>
   <p>The picture of life had changed for him. Before this time he had
known it but speculatively; now he thought he knew it as a practical
man; though perhaps he did not, even yet. Nevertheless humanity stood
before him no longer in the pensive sweetness of Italian art, but in
the staring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum, and with the
leer of a study by Van Beers.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>Although the Poe-like horrifics of Wiertz are still remembered
and have won a small place in the history of Romanticism, Van Beers,
who seems to have deliberately invited comparison with him, has now
been completely forgotten. In Hardy's day, however, he enjoyed
something of a succ&egrave;s de scandale with periodic
exhibitions in Bond Street. One of these, held in November 1886, was
condemned by a critic writing in The Magazine of Art as appealing
<squote>to a class of sensations which have but little to do with those
which art... should aim at evoking</squote>. Even <squote>as a purveyor of
horrors</squote> the artist was unsuccessful, for he entirely lacked <squote>the
vastness of conception, the measure of sincerity which gave to the
art &mdash; if we must so designate it &mdash; of a Wiertz, resulting, as it did,
from the real hallucinations of a diseased brain, a certain interest
and a raison d'&ecirc;tre</squote>.
   <p>Towards the end of Tess, Clare returns at length from his
wanderings, and we are given a striking picture of the outward change
in him which has accompanied the inner:
<quote>
   <p>You could see the skeleton behind the man, and almost the ghost
behind the skeleton. He matched Crivelli's dead Christus. His
sunken eye-pits were of morbid hue, and the light in his eyes had
waned. The angular hollows and lines of his aged ancestors had
succeeded to their reign in his face twenty years before their time.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>The painting to which Hardy refers is in the National Gallery.
Here Hardy's imagination is stimulated to enlarge upon the allusion
and to paint a word-picture of great power. Crivelli was one of his
favourite painters, and it is easy to see why the severity of
Crivelli's types &mdash; the farthest remove, as they are, from the pretty &mdash;
particularly appealed to him.
   <p>As Hardy masters this technique he employs it more and more for
dramatic effect. Tess again provides a fine example, in that
melancholy scene at the end of the book when Angel Clare and 'Liza-Lu
walk slowly up to the summit of the West Hill above Wintoncester to
watch for the prison flag that will tell them that Tess's execution
has been carried out: <squote>They moved on hand in hand, and never spoke a
word, the drooping of their heads being that of Giotto's <quote>Two
Apostles</quote>.</squote> The picture to which Hardy here refers is a fragment
of a fresco purchased for the National Gallery in 1856. It comes from
a large decoration in the Carmine in Florence which was at that time
believed to be by Giotto but which has since been reattributed to
Spinello Aretino. The two heads originally formed part of a <squote>Burial
of St. John the Baptist</squote>. Even more touching, perhaps, is the
long, beautiful description, earlier in the same novel, of the labours
of Tess and Marion in the fields, where again the image of two bowed
heads is evoked by a simple and telling pictorial allusion: <squote>The
pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads
would have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception of
the two Marys.</squote>

<text id=LOBJ64>
While the technical quality of the tapestry is high, the style is
rather coarse and there is an element of doubt as to its origin in the
imperial workshops.
   <p>The second object which may refer to an imperial triumph is the
ivory casket now in the Cathedral Treasury at Troyes. On the sides
the casket is remarkable for hunting scenes of considerable power and
for phoenixes in the Chinese style (Fig. 125); on the lid two
mounted emperors placed symmetrically on either side of a town are
offered a city-crown by a woman emerging from the gate followed by
townsfolk (Fig. 126). It has been suggested that this last scene is
related to the Triumph of Basil 2 but, although undoubtedly
portraying a victorious emperor, judging from the other scenes on the
casket, it seems not to be connected with any particular event. A
date, however, in the eleventh century is possible.
   <p>More textiles may be assigned to the reign of Basil 2. Several
fragments of silk woven in compound twill with representations of
large stylized lions at Berlin, Du"sseldorf, Krefeld and Cologne
(Fig. 127) bear inscriptions referring to the Emperors Constantine
8 and Basil 2, the sovereigns who love Christ. Constantine 8,
younger brother of Basil 2, idle and pleasure-loving like his father
Romanus 2, ruled jointly with the Bulgaroctonos between 976 and
1025. Earlier versions of this type of silk, however, were known at
one time. In the Cathedral at Auxerre under Bishop St. Gaudry
(918-933) were two fragments of a Lion silk bearing the inscription
<squote>in the reign of Leo, the sovereign who loves Christ</squote>, which must
refer to the Emperor Leo 6 (886-912). At Siegburg another great
Lion silk, now destroyed, bore an inscription referring to Romanus 1
Lecapenus and his son Christopher, whose joint reign lasted from 921
to 923. A number of reduced, coarser versions of these Lion silks
have survived but without inscriptions and in this case it is tempting
to make a distinction between work done in the imperial factory and
work done in the city. The magnificent Elephant silk (Fig. 128),
introduced into the tomb of Charlemagne at Aachen by the Emperor Otto
3 during the <squote>recognition</squote> of the year 1000, must also date from
the early part of the reign of Basil 2 and Constantine 8, although
the Greek inscription refers only to the fact that it was made <squote>under
Michael, \kitonite and \eidikos, and Peter, \archon of the
Zeuxippos</squote>. In addition, two Eagle silks may claim to have come
from the imperial workshops under these emperors. The Chasuble of
St. Albuin (975-1006) in the Cathedral Treasury at Brixen is made up
from a silk compound twill woven with a pattern of large stylized
eagles in dark green on a rose-purple ground with large dark green
rosettes in the intervening spaces &mdash; eyes, beaks, claws, and the ring
in the beak are yellow (Fig. 129). The Shroud of St. Germain in
the Church of Saint-Eus&egrave;be at Auxerre bears an identical pattern
but in colours of dark blue, dark blue-green, and yellow, and the
quality is finer than the Brixen silk. Unfortunately neither of these
superb silks bears an inscription.
   <p>With the possible exception of the last two silks, which differ
considerably from Islamic Eagle silks that have survived, it may be
said that Byzantine silk production of this time was heavily indebted
to Persian and Abbasid models. The Elephant silk is clearly based on
a Buwaiyid model for its subject matter and particularly for the
stylized tree and its foliage behind the elephant, though the border
of the medallion contains more specifically Byzantine ornament. It
may be that the introduction of the inscriptions referring to the
emperors and used as part of the design is an adoption of Islamic
\tiraz protocol. Later in the century, when a series of
particularly subtle silks, known for convenience as <squote>incised
twills</squote> because the pattern in a silk of one colour appears to be
engraved, are known in several sequences, the problem of deciding
which were made in the Byzantine world and which were made under
Islam, or by Islamic craftsmen in the Byzantine Empire, becomes acute.
Some bear fine Kufic inscriptions with the name of an Amir of
Diyarbakr in northern Syria dating about 1025, others bear polite
wishes in Kufic, some have no inscriptions at all, and there is one
remarkable silk, with the portrait of a Byzantine emperor, found in
the tomb of St. Ulrich of Augsburg (d. 955), which seems to be
without question of Greek manufacture. The textiles found in the tomb
of Pope Clement 2 (d. 1047) at Bamberg, of which one is closely
related to a silk from the tomb of King Edward the Confessor (d.
1066), present similar problems. There can be no doubt, however, that
the imperial Byzantine silks have a power and a dignity, a feeling for
design and texture, seldom rivalled in the history of textiles. There
is little wonder that Bishop Liutprand of Cremona was tempted on his
return from his unsatisfactory mission to the Emperor Nicephorus
Phocas to smuggle imperial silks through the Byzantine customs.
   <p>The mosaic panel in the South Gallery of Agia Sophia at
Constantinople with the portraits of the Emperor Constantine 9
Monomachos and the Empress Zoe standing on either side of the seated
Christ presents certain problems (Fig. 130). It continues the
tradition of ex-voto mosaic panels representing the Augusti
bearing gifts familiar in San Vitale at Ravenna in the sixth century
and panels of a less exalted nature in the Church of St. Demetrius
at Salonika in the seventh century. But in this panel all three heads
and the inscriptions are substitutions. It is probable that the
original mosaic was executed between 1028 and 1034 and it represented
the Empress Zoe (1028-1050), daughter of Constantine 8, and her
first husband Romanus 3 Argyrus (1028-1034). There is no
documentary evidence, incidentally, that the Empress Zoe was
interested in patronizing large-scale works of art though she had a
fancy for expensive trinkets and chemical experiments, but Romanus 3
instigated repairs to Agia Sophia and to the Church of St. Mary at
Blachernae. His name would seem to fit the space allowed for the
inscription better than that of Michael his successor and, since he
was unpopular, it was more likely to be excised than that of Michael
4 the Paphlagonian (1034-1041), who was well liked and the uncle of
Michael 5 Kalaphates (1041-1042). Zoe, who was not fitted by
temperament to govern, according to Michael Psellus, retained the
affection of the people in spite of her eccentricities. She had lived
in retirement during the later years of Michael 4's rule and had
been persuaded to adopt his nephew as Emperor. Michael 5, however,
induced the Senate to banish Zoe as a nun to the island of Prinkipo.
It was presumably at this time that the mosaic panel was defaced.
Michael 5's triumph was brief. The people were not prepared to see
a daughter born to the purple of the Macedonian house treated with
such contumely and they rioted. The Empress was brought back from
exile. She and her sister Theodora, who had long been a nun in the
convent of the Petrion by the Phanar, were reinstated in the purple.
Michael 5 was persuaded to leave the altar in the Church of St.
John of Studius where he had taken refuge, and was blinded in a street
of the city. The two sisters, who had little love for one another,
ruled for a few months as co-Empresses and coins were struck with
their images (Fig. 131) but later in the year of 1042 Zoe at an
advanced age took another husband, Constantine Monomachos (1042-1055),
and Theodora was kept in the background of affairs. About this time
the imperial portraits were restored. It is still far from clear,
however, why it was necessary to restore the head of Christ.
   <p>As opposed to the figures of Constantine and Justinian on the
tympanum of Basil 2 (Fig. 123), which are seen in depth and
modelled with some solidity, the bodies of the Augusti are little more
than lay figures of imperial power. In contrast with the Virgin in
the south vestibule the drapery of Christ has become considerably more
mannered with its cross-currents of folds and the face shows a marked
difference of approach, more sketchy and schematic. But in view of
the different styles current in Constantinople it would be rash to
press these contrasts too far. The figures of Constantine and
Justinian were probably copied from earlier imperial portraits, which
would give them the definition that the Macedonian Augusti lack. The
portrayal of the reigning Augusti behind a flat curtain of patterned
dress and regalia establishes a convention of official portraiture
which continued to the end. The heads in official portraiture, on the
other hand, are presented in terms which presuppose recognition.
While the restored heads in the Zoe panel have become considerably
more conceptualized than all three heads in the tympanum of Basil
2 &mdash; the accentuation of the cheek-bones by circular devices, the
broadening of the planes of the face &mdash; the Empress and her consort are
rendered as plausible historic statements.
   <p>Constantine 9, brought back from exile in Mytilene to marry an
aged Empress preoccupied with religion and making scents, flaunted a
beautiful Caucasian mistress at public ceremonies, but for all his
love of entertainment, he was by no means unaware of the
responsibilities of his position. He built the church and convent of
St. George of the Manganes and founded the Nea Moni on Chios after
the miraculous discovery of an icon by shepherds on Mount Privation.
It is probable that mosaicists were sent from the capital to decorate
the church on Chios. Fragments of their work have survived including
a Virgin Orans in the apse, a few angels and saints, and fourteen
scenes ranging from the Annunciation to the Pentecost. But the
sombre, forceful style of these mosaics has unfortunately no
counterpart in the capital and contrasts strangely with the slightly
inconclusive images of imperial power in Agia Sophia. The style at
the Nea Moni does not resemble the work done at Osios Loukas in Phocis
about the middle of the eleventh century, which seems to be the work
of a provincial school, nor the uneven quality of the work done in
Agia Sophia at Kiev about 1045 with the help of mosaicists sent from
Constantinople. The style, moreover, contrasts with that of the
mosaics executed in the narthex of the Church of the Dormition at
Nicaea, now destroyed, under the patronage of the patrician Nicephorus
after the earthquake of 1065. This decoration consisted of a double
cross against a ground of stars within a roundel in the centre of the
vault surrounded by medallions containing the busts of Christ
Pantocrator, St. John the Baptist, St. Joachim and St. Anne; in
the lunette over the door there was a bust of the Virgin Orans; in the
four corners of the vault there were the four Evangelists. The
meaning of this iconographical programme is far from clear and the
absence of comparable programmes in the capital handicaps speculation.
Stylistically the forms are rather broad and heavy; the face of the
Virgin Orans in the lunette over the door seems to be a development of
the Virgin and Child over the door in the south vestibule of Agia
Sophia but the work, as far as one may judge from the the photographs,
seems coarser. In the portrayal of the Evangelists the bodies tend to
disintegrate under the pattern of folds; in St. Matthew, for
example, the relationship of the upper part of the body to the lower
is uneasy and the right thigh seems unwarrantably stressed &mdash; this
figure executed during the reign of Constantine 10 Dukas (1059-1067)
looks forward to late Comnene art; St. Luke, on the other hand,
depends almost directly from the works executed in the palace
scriptoria; in all four figures, the tendency of the drapery to create
its own pattern counter to the form it covers echoes one of the main
features of middle Byzantine style.

<head>RITUAL ART</head>
<head>by CECIL ROTH</head>
   <p>A CHARACTERISTIC recommendation of the Talmud justifies and
proves the antiquity of the ritual art of the Jewish synagogue and
home. Rabbis make this comment about the Biblical verse <quote>This is my
God, and I will glorify &lsqb;lit. <squote>adorn</squote>&rsqb; him</quote> (Exodus, 15, 2):
<quote>Adorn thyself before Him in the performance of the commandments.
Make before him a goodly \succah, and goodly \lulab, and a
goodly \shophar, and goodly fringes for your garments, and a
goodly Sepher Torah... and bind it up with goodly
wrappings.</quote> Elsewhere, we learn of the adornments hung in the
\succah, and of the gold fillets used to bind up the \lulab,
and more than once of the wrappings for the sacred books. But there
is no evidence that at this time any of these appurtenances had any
uniformity or were expressly made for a specific purpose. With the
exception of a few eight-burnered clay lamps presumably intended for
use on the feast of Hanukkah, there is barely any evidence of
specifically-made Jewish ritual adornments, other than those of the
Temple, until the close of the first millenium.
   <p>It must have been about this period that their manufacture began,
for not long after we read of such objects as commonplace. Thus in an
inventory of the property of the Palestinian Synagogue in Fostat
(Cairo), drawn up in 1186-87, we find scheduled <quote>Two Torah-crowns
made out of silver, and three pairs of finials (\rimmonim) made of
silver, and twenty-two Torah-covers made of silk, some of them
brocaded with gold,</quote> and so on. Presumably, domestic ritual objects
began to be made at much the same time. The name of Rabbi Meir of
Rothenburg, the great German Jewish ritual art as we know it now had
begun to  frequently in connection with our literary
evidences, and it may be assumed that by his day Jewish ritual art as
we know it now had begun to assume its form.
   <p>Little or nothing of this date, however, has been preserved to
the present time, our evidence being indirect. The primary reason for
this was presumably the vicissitudes of Jewish life. Synagogues
everywhere were sacked, burned, and pillaged; communities were driven
into exile, expressly forbidden to take with them anything made of
precious material: synagogues could sell their sacred treasures in
order to ransom prisoners or succor refugees. As a result of all
these and similar recurrent crises, as well as normal wear and the
natural tendency (from the antiquary's point of view disastrous) to
replace the old by the new, Jewish ritual art of the medieval period
has disappeared almost entirely. Hardly more than a handful of
specimens anterior to the sixteenth century are now traceable. This
generalization, to be sure, may perhaps need qualification in due
course. If careful and expert inspection could be made of the
property of ancient and even modern synagogues, especially in the
East, with the same care as has been devoted to the study of ancient
manuscripts, it is not improbable that some memorable ritual objects
of great antiquity might even now be discovered.
   <p>However that may be, the fact remains that the objects of Jewish
ritual art which are now extant are virtually all of the post-medieval
period. After a trickle of the sixteenth century, there is a great
mass of material of the seventeenth and eighteenth, some of it very
fine. Perhaps an unduly large proportion is German in origin,
reflecting the religious enthusiasm, economic well-being and good
taste of the new groupings in those countries, especially the
newly-arisen class of Court Jews. It may be remarked that here
domestic religious adornments figure in great abundance side by side
with those intended for the synagogue. The taste and charm of some of
the objects then manufactured in Poland and Eastern Europe belies the
general impression of the economic misery and unaesthetic outlook of
the Jewish communities in this area.
   <p>On the whole, these objects reflect the tastes and fashions of
the countries and periods in which they were manufactured. To be
sure, in some cases the craftsmen were Jews. Gold and silver-smithery
was one of the characteristic Jewish occupations in most countries.
It is believed that from early times until the modern era, Jews in
the Eastern countries were responsible for the manufacture of most of
these objects. But in Western Europe, with the growing tendency to
exclude the Jews from handicrafts after the period of the Crusades,
this was different. Moreover, in remote communities where a Jewish
craftsman might not be available, it was necessary to have recourse to
the local silversmiths. However that may be, it is certain that much
Jewish ritual metal-work is of non-Jewish manufacture; in England,
Germany and Holland it often bears the mark of the Gentile
manufacturers, sometimes well-known masters of their craft &mdash; e.g.
the prolific Matthews Wolff (Augusburg, c. 1700), Jeremiah Zobel
(Frankfurt \am Main, c. 1700), and John Ruslen, Frederick Kandler,
Hester Bateman and William Grundy (London, 18th century). We know of
at least two medieval contracts for the manufacture of silver
ornaments for the Torah, made between Gentile craftsmen and the
leaders of the local Jewish communities &mdash; one from Arles (1439), the
other from Avignon (1477). In the former instance, silversmith Robin
Tissard undertook that the commission was to be executed in a room
placed at his disposal in the house of one of the local Jews, and that
no work should be done on Sabbaths or Jewish holy days.
   <p>On the other hand, besides the vast amount of anonymous work of
this type which falls into this category, a good deal was carried out
by ascertainable Jewish craftsmen of some reputation. We know, for
example, of the London silversmith Abraham \d'Oliviera (d. 1750),
who has been mentioned elsewhere in this work in connection with his
work as an artist-engraver, who designed and executed a good deal of
ritual silver in London in the first half of the eighteenth century;
and his younger contemporary Myer Myers (1723-94), first President of
the Silversmith's Guild of New York, who carried out some
distinguished work for synagogues (as well as churches) in America.
   <p>Certain decorative features became very common in, and almost
characteristic of, the Jewish ritual art of the post-medieval period.
In St. Peter's in Rome there is a spirally fluted bronze column,
the colonna santa, late Classical in origin; it is legendary
said to have been brought from the Temple in Jerusalem, where Jesus
leaned against it while disputing with the rabbis. From the
Renaissance period, two twisted columns, apparently copied from the
colonna santa, and inevitably identified with Jakhin and Boaz
of Kings 7, 21, began to figure as a typical feature on the engraved
title-pages of Hebrew books (see fig. 175). It was from there that
this feature was copied on various objects of European Jewish ritual
art until the end of the eighteenth century.
   <p>Other symbols which are commonly found include the lion,
representing the Lion of the Tribe of Judah (Genesis 49, 9) which,
as we have seen, was one of the most common symbols found in Jewish
art from classical antiquity. This illustrated also the Rabbinic
dictum (Ethics of the Fathers, 5, 23) that a man should be bold as a
lion, light as an eagle and fleet as a deer to fulfill the will of his
Father in Heaven. The eagle and deer also figure, though less
commonly (fig. 138). The two Tablets of Stone bearing the Ten
Commandments, in the shape which had become conventional in the Middle
Ages (among the Christians perhaps earlier than among the Jews) is
found very frequently (fig. 139). Sometimes, too, we see other
ancient Temple furniture, such as the altar and table of shew-bread,
perpetuating the tradition already found in medieval manuscripts.
   <p>A gift presented by a Cohen would often bear a representation
of the hands joined in the priestly benediction, of a Levite that
of the ewer and basin used by members of that tribe in laving the
priest's hands. In Italy (and later in the ex-Marrano communities)
other family badges and armorial bearings were not unusual. The whole
would be commonly surmounted by a crown, symbolizing the traditional
Crown of the Law: sometimes by a triple crown, in reference to the
Rabbinic dictum (Ethics of the Fathers, 4, 17) that there are three
crowns &mdash; that of the Torah, of Monarchy, and of Priesthood <quote>and that
of a Good Name surpasses them all.</quote>
<head>2</head>
   <p>THE RITUAL art of the synagogue naturally centered on the
Scroll of the Pentateuch or Sepher Torah, used in the Biblical
readings, and wound upon two staves. It is impossible to determine
when the practice arose of covering this by an ornament of precious
metal. Probably, however, it was relatively late. The Talmud (Baba
Bathra 14a) speaks of the Pentateuch deposited by Moses in the
Tabernacle as being on silver rollers, but this legendary model does
not seem to have been imitated, and in representations in synagogue
interiors and on Holy Scrolls in various media (gold glasses, etc.)
in the classical period there is no trace of anything in the way of
ornament. The account of the sack of the Synagogue of Minorca in 438
speaks of the synagogical ornaments and silver, without giving any
further details. The same is true of the sacred appurtenances which
Pope Gregory the Great ordered to be restored to the Synagogue of
Palermo in 599.
   <p>In Oriental communities, the Scroll of the Law was enclosed
entirely in a case (\tik), which was placed upright on the reading
desk and opened out for reading the prescribed portion. This was the
general practice in Iraq and the neighboring countries as early as the
10th century, and has remained to our own day. These cases were
usually of wood, frequently with inscriptions applied in metal, but
were occasionally of silver, finely worked and engraved, and sometimes
of gold. In the former metal, a few fine examples are extant; none,
however, which are anterior to the seventeenth century (fig. 140).
Though the \tik was commonly used only in Eastern communities,
cases were made for the scrolls sometimes also in Western countries,
especially for well-to-do householders, who wished to have portable
Torah-scrolls on their travels. An exquisite pair of such cases in
silver, with polygonal sections opening on hinges and spirally fluted
handles and finials, was executed in 1766-7 by a Gentile master
craftsman for <quote>Dr.</quote> Samuel \de Falk, the so-called Baal
Shem of London.
   <p>The practice of placing crowns of precious metal on the
Sepher Torah &mdash; at least on such special occasions as the feast
of the Rejoicing of the Law &mdash; seems also to have been established in
Iraq as early as the tenth century (Shaare Semahot, p. 117).
The Fostat contract of 1186-7 lists among other objects <quote>Two
Sepher-Crowns made out of silver.</quote> This form of ornament
was naturally suggested by the Rabbinic dictum cited above which
refers to the dignity of learning as <quote>the Crown of the Law</quote> &mdash; a
phrase inscribed innumerable times on such objects and others
connected with the synagogue ritual. These objects, which became
known generally as \atarah, were at the outset especially
associated with Southern Europe. Aaron of Lunel tells in his
Sepher haManhig how in 1203 he persuaded some community which
he visited, in Southern France or Spain, to make a silver crown
(\atarah) for the Sepher Torah instead of decorating it
with miscellaneous female adornments. The contract already referred
to of March 12, 1439 between the Avignonese silversmith Robin Tissard
and the \baylons of the Jewish community of Arles was for
manufacture, for a total sum of fifty florins, of an \atarah for
the <quote>scroll of the Jews,</quote> hexagonal in shape, superimposed on a
copper drum with which Tissard was to be provided. There were to be
six towers &mdash; one at each corner &mdash; the top crenellated like a fortress,
and the surface to be engraved in imitation of masonry. Chains and
columns decorated with lions' heads were also to be part of the
design.

<text id=LOBJ66>
Referring to this very impressive example of expressionist
painting, Ensor himself stated that ~<squote>Je me suis joyeusement
confin&eacute; dans le milieu solitaire o&ugrave; tr&ocirc;ne le masque, tout de
violence, de lumi&egrave;re et d'&eacute;clat. Le masque me dit: fraicheur de
ton, expression suraigue", d&eacute;cor somptueux, grands gestes
inattendus, mouvements d&eacute;sordonn&eacute;s.</squote>
   <p>Following the Belgian school, we come to the French Nabis with
fine examples of the intimiste work of Vuillard and, in
particular, of Bonnard whose Nu &agrave; Contre-Jour, painted in
1908, and lent by the Mus&eacute;es Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique,
Bruxelles, is possessed of every single quality of drawing, painting
and composition that any, and every, artist seeks to achieve.
   <p>This exhibition of <squote>Les Sources du 20&egrave;me Si&egrave;cle</squote>
has been so well planned and displayed that one is continually
startled and excited by the contrasting schools and groups of artists
that confront one as one moves on from room to room. After the
reposed and subdued work of the Nabis we suddenly come face to face
with the agitated, violent chromatic paintings of the Fauves and the
cynical, cruel expressionism of Rouault whose large strident
water-colour on paper of M. et Mme. Poulot (collection of
M. Philippe Leclercq, Hem) reproduced here, is one of his greatest
works.
   <p>Next come the German Expressionists and the paintings of Nolde
and of Munch, in particular, have been carefully selected to indicate
the important role that this School played in the formation of
20th-century art. \L'Angoisse, by Munch (which is reproduced
here, and lent by the Collections Municipales des Beaux-Arts,
Oslo) is, to say the least, agonizing in its able form of expression.
   <p>And then we come to the British section which is very revealing
(for the French public, anyway) in that the accent is much more on
arts and crafts than on painting and sculpture. The artist-architect
who stands out most prominently is Charles F. Annesley Voysey,
member of the Art Workers Guild and nominated, in 1936, Royal Designer
for industry. Principal among the number of exhibits lent to the
Museum of Modern Art by the Victoria and Albert Museum, is an
enchanting tapestry, designed by Voysey and which was executed, in
1899, by Alexander Morton and Co; and a series of delightful
wall-paper designs by Arthur Heygate Macmurdo, who was a close friend
of William Morris and of Ruskin.
   <p>From the elegant designs of these British artists we are shown
the fantastic French <squote>style metro</squote> furniture of the turn of the
century. A complete dining-room suite has been transported from the
Mus&eacute;e de l'&Eacute;cole de Nancy and installed in a separate room
in the exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. This ensemble,
executed in 1903, has to be seen to be believed. This likewise
applies to the ghastly style of the <squote>Lit Papillon</squote>, also lent
from the Museum in Nancy. But it was not only in France that the
craftsmen produced furniture and fittings of extraordinary and
extravagant design. During the reign of Queen Victoria, sensational
<squote>works of art</squote> were fabricated such as the startling dining-room
table centre-piece, executed by Alfred Gilbert and his assistants, to
commemorate the jubilee of Queen Victoria, in 1887, and which Her
Majesty the Queen has graciously lent to the present exhibition in
Paris.
   <p>Again, by way of contrast, the exhibition continues with the work
of the Cubists and important painting-collages by Braque and Picasso.
L&eacute;ger, too, is exhibited to marked advantage with his cubist
composition, La Noce, painted in 1910, and owned by the Museum
of Modern Art in Paris. Guillaume Apollinaire, speaking of this
canvas, said <squote>Les gens de la Noce se dissimulent l'un derri&egrave;re
l'autre. Encore un petit effort pour se d&eacute;barrasser de la
perspective, du truc mis&eacute;rable, de la perspective, de cette
quatri&egrave;me dimension &agrave; rebours, la perspective, de ce moyen de
tout rapetisser in&eacute;vitablement.</squote>
   <p>And then we come to the grandfather of the Peintres de
Dimanche, Le Douanier Rousseau. His Charmeuse de Serpents
(from the Louvre) is surely one of the greatest, and most natural,
of primitive paintings.
   <p>Der Blaue Reiter group of avant-garde artists is
admirably represented with important paintings by Kandinsky, among
which the dramatic and powerful composition entitled Avec l'Arc
Noir, painted in 1912, and lent by the widow of the artist; by
Jawlensky, whose Portait de Jeune Fille (from the Kunstmuseum,
Dusseldorf) is a superb example of his work; and by Franz Marc whose
well-known composition of Les Trois Chevaux Rouges (lent by
M. Paul Geier, Rome) typifies his search after the
<squote>spiritualization of nature</squote>.
   <p>Nearby are hung a few small water-colours and drawings by Klee.
This is the only artist in this very important and instructive
exhibition whose work I find poorly represented. The originality, the
fascination of his very individual art certainly merited more than
this.
   <p>Futurism, the short-lived beginning of the century revolutionary
movement, founded by Marinetti who spoke of <squote>a roaring motor-car,
which runs like a machine-gun and is more beautiful than the Winged
Victory of Samothrace...</squote> is mainly represented by Boccioni with a
disturbing quasi-religious composition entitled \Mati&egrave;re (lent
by M. Gianni Mattioli, Milan).
   <p>The origin of pure modern abstract painting is fully exemplified
in the work of Mondrian. In the present exhibition I was intrigued by
his L'Arbre Rouge (from the Gemeente Museum, La Haye) for I
always remember Mondrian telling me, in his own studio in Paris, that
he was more interested in painting a lamp-post than a tree!
   <p><squote>Les sources du 20&egrave;me Si&egrave;cle</squote> exhibition concludes
with some fine examples of the work of Modigliani, \de Chirico, and
Chagall. Kokoschka, I am pleased to say, is very well represented
with several portraits and landscapes which reveal the true talent of
this artist who, I feel, is still not sufficiently known and
appreciated.
   <p>There is much I would have liked to say about many other
interesting exhibitions now taking place in Paris. But I find I have
sacrificed my allotted space to this outstanding exhibition at the
Museum of Modern Art. Thus I am obliged to leave reviews of the
exhibition of sculpture by Lilla Kunvari (at the Galeries Raymond
Duncan); of enamels, by Andr&eacute; Marchand (at the Galerie David &amp;
Garnier); of painting by De Gallard (at the newly opened Galerie
Herv&eacute;); and of the annual &Eacute;cole \de Paris show (at the Galerie
Charpentier) until the next issue.
   <p>
   <p>NEW ART GALLERIES continue to spring up in Paris all over the
place. Since six months ago, when I calculated that there were more
than two hundred and fifty of them, I reckon that the figure is now
not far off the three hundred mark. As this is one of the busiest
seasons of the year for exhibitions, I am receiving daily so many
invitations for private views that I have to decide which shows are
not worth seeing. The other day, one of the small Left Bank
galleries sent me an invitation for a new exhibition and stamped on
the envelope was ~<squote>Les tableux sont le meilleur placement au
monde</squote> (<squote>paintings are the best investment in the world</squote>),
which is proof enough of the very profitable business now being done
by the Paris dealers during the present boom.
   <p>After reviewing the remarkable exhibition at the Museum of Modern
Art, of <squote>Sources du 20&egrave;me Si&egrave;cle</squote>, in last month's
Paris Commentary, there was not space enough left for me to refer to
Lilla Kunvari's sculpture, at the Galeries Raymond Duncan; and Michel
\de Gallard's paintings at the new Herv&eacute; gallery. I have followed
the progress of this talented young artist's work since I called on
him, shortly after the war, in his tiny, drab <squote>studio</squote> in the
squalid La Ruche building way over in the 15th arrondissement.
   <p>De Gallard managed to escape from La Ruche a few years ago and he
now lives outside Paris where he leads a retired and happy life
painting realistic scenes of the countryside and of the peasants
working in the fields. His drawing has gained in strength and his
palette is becoming more varied while he seeks to bring more light
into his well balanced compositions. His impressive Cathedrale de
Sens, which was reproduced in last month's Studio, testified
to these qualities.
   <p>Lilla Kunvari is an able Hungarian sculptor who was educated in
France and who studied art in the Paris academies. Her drawings have
the delicate force of Rodin while her small terra-cotta busts and
figures (like that of \L'Orateur: see my last Paris Commentary)
recall the grotesque heads so cleverly caricatured and modelled by
Daumier. For all that, Lilla Kunvari's art has an appealing
individuality.
   <p>One of the most thrilling exhibitions I have seen for a long time
at the very active Galerie \de France is that of recent paintings by
Tamayo who is considered one of the greatest living Mexican artists
and whose work is well known and admired in America, but less known in
France, and even less in the U.K.
   <p>Tamayo was born in Oaxaca, in 1899. He took to painting when
very young and, at sixteen years of age, studied at the Academie des
Beaux-Arts de San Carlos. He left the Academy three years later and
devoted himself to a study of the Impressionists and the Cubists. He
held his first one-man exhibition when twenty-two years old at a time
when he was attempting to combine in his compositions both the
pre-Columbian tradition and the modern expressionism that he had
learnt from his study of the School of Paris. In 1929, he was
nominated Professor at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts in Mexico City.
Four years later he executed the first of a series of outsize mural
decorations for the &Eacute;cole Nationale de Musique, Mexico City.
   <p>In 1943, Tamayo moved to New York where he held his first one-man
show there at the Pierre Matisse Gallery. Since the war, he has
travelled widely throughout Europe and has exhibited at all the big
international shows while executing frescoes here and there. I saw
and spoke to him in Paris during his exhibition at the Galerie \de
France and he told me he had to hasten back to Mexico City where he
had to start work on a gigantic mural for the Mus&eacute;e de
l'Histoire which will measure about 100 metres by 15 metres! He
reckoned that this will take him at least a full year's hard work to
complete.
   <p>Tamayo is, indeed, a prodigious worker. The twenty-five canvases
on view at the Galerie \de France represented only a part of what he
had produced in 1960. His particular form of expression is difficult
to describe on account of its striking originality; but what is
apparent is the strange and unusual combination of Mexican folklore
art and a quasi-abstract European form of painting, as can be judged
from his Homme au Mur, reproduced here.
   <p>At the same time there exists a fantasy, especially in his
smaller canvases, which reminds one of the intriguing and charming
esprit of Paul Klee. A certain cubist expressionism is to be found in
his compositions wherein the arithmetical balance is based on the laws
of The Golden Section. And there is a haunting, evasive, subtle
quality about his colour orchestration of harmonies of pastel hues.
The texture, too, of his paintings is of a very individual and
striking quality. Tamayo himself told me of the secrets of this: he
mixes his paint with powdered marble.
   <p>An exhibition which was not widely advertised but which was, in
my opinion, of equal importance and significance to that of Tamayo &mdash;
though quite different in aspect &mdash; was the show held at the re-opened
Galerie Jeanne Bucher, in the Rue \de Seine, of recent paintings by
Vieira \da Silva, whose work I have always greatly admired. I hope to
be able to write about her at some length in a forthcoming series of
articles in THE STUDIO on leading abstract, and near-abstract,
artists of the School of Paris, so I shall praise her work here in
short terms.
   <p>Like those of Tamayo, Vieira \da Silva's paintings are very
individual and original and this in itself is a rare enough quality
these days.

<head>A GROUP OF ENGLISH AND IMPORTED MEDIEVAL POTTERY FROM LESNES
ABBEY, KENT; AND THE TRADE IN EARLY HISPANO-MORESQUE POTTERY TO
ENGLAND</head>
<head>By G. C. DUNNING, F.S.A.</head>
   <p>THE group of medieval pottery described in this paper was found
at Lesnes Abbey in June 1959, when the smaller of two stone-lined pits
added against the west end of the Reredorter was cleared. The pit
measured 8 ft. by 5 ft. internally, and was about 10 ft. deep.
The greater part of the filling, about 7 ft. in depth, consisted of
chalk and stone rubble, fragments of sandy mortar, a few pieces of
worked stone, and broken roofing tiles. Below this filling was a
layer of dark soil, about 2 ft. in depth, at the bottom of the pit.
All the pottery was found in the layer of dark soil; there is thus no
doubt that it is contemporary, and was absolutely sealed by several
feet of building debris. I am indebted to the officers of the
Historic Buildings Section of the London County Council for these
details, and for permission to examine the pottery and prepare this
report for publication.
   <p>The pottery belongs to six vessels, of which four are almost
complete and must have been thrown away whole. It is divided into the
following classes:

   <p>1. Two green-glazed jugs of types frequently found in the City of
London, and probably made in east Surrey.
   <p>2. An unglazed jug, probably made at Limpsfield, Surrey.
   <p>3. A jug of polychrome ware decorated with birds and shields, and
part of a glazed pitcher. Both were made in western France in the
region of Saintes.
   <p>4. A large cover of Hispano-Moresque lustreware, imported from
Malaga.

   <p>The group is outstanding for several reasons. In a single find
pottery made in the locality is associated with imports from two
different countries on the Continent. The three English jugs are of
different types, and it is valuable to have them together in a group.
The polychrome jug is a type long recognized as imported to England,
and brought here by the wine trade of Gascony. The cover of Spanish
lustreware is new to British medieval archaeology, and increases the
range of imported pottery known to have reached England in the course
of sea-trade.
   <p>The date of the group is closely determined by the polychrome
jug. Pottery of this class was made in western France and exported to
England during a very short period. The available evidence, cited
below (p. 5), points to the period c. 1280-1300 for the date
of the group of pottery from Lesnes Abbey.
<head>1. GREEN-GLAZED JUGS (pl. 1a and figs. 1, 2)</head>
   <p>Fig. 1. Baluster jug, 16 1/4 in. high, made of light grey
sandy ware, mostly covered outside by a buff slip, and glazed streaky
light green on the neck and body to below the bulge. The profile
shows a continuous curve, the only demarcation between neck and body
being a ridge at two-thirds of the height. The handle is plain and
circular in section. The edge of the base is slightly moulded, and
the middle of the base sags slightly below the level of the edge.
   <p>This is a typical example of the standard type of baluster jug
frequently found in the City of London. The slender form, absence of
decoration, and unstable base suggest that the type was not primarily
intended for use at the table, but rather for drawing water out of a
well. That pottery jugs were used for this purpose is shown by the
accumulation of over fifty jugs, many intact, in the filling of a
medieval well excavated by Mr. S. S. Frere between St.
George's Street and Burgate, Canterbury, in 1952.
   <p>Fig. 2. Ovoid jug, 12 1/4 in. high, made of light grey sandy
ware with light reddish buff surface, covered by yellow slip. Mottled
green glaze covers the neck and body to below the bulge. The neck is
cylindrical, separated from the bulbous body by a ridge, and the base
is retracted above the foot-ring on which the jug stands steadily.
The rim has an outward slope, with a groove and moulding below, and
is pinched to form a small lip. At the middle of the neck is a broad
rounded cordon between a ridge and a narrow flat cordon. The handle
is plain and circular in section.
   <p>The ovoid jug with retracted foot is also a type common in
London, and sometimes profusely decorated.
   <p>The contemporaneity of these two jugs is confirmed by the finding
of fragments of both types in medieval buildings in Joyden's Wood,
near Bexley, where the occupation is limited to the period c.
1280-1320. The kilns where they were made have not yet been
located, but probably they were to the south of London, in east
Surrey. One site was at Earlswood, where potters' refuse and wasters
 have been known for a long time.
<head>2. UNGLAZED JUG (fig. 3)</head>
   <p>Large part of neck, body, and base of a small jug, about 6.1
in. high, made of grey sandy ware with dark grey surface, unglazed.
The body is bulging, with wide sagging base. The upper part of the
body is marked by fine horizontal grooves and wheel-marks. The neck
contracts upwards, and the rim was everted. The lower part of the
handle is preserved separately; it is roughly circular in section, and
deeply stab-marked down the back.
   <p>Unglazed jugs of grey ware, rather archaic in character, are
known from a number of sites in north-west Kent. The major site is
Eynsford Castle, where excavations by the Ministry of Works have
produced many jugs of this type in deposits of the end of the
thirteenth century. Other sites are at Joyden's Wood near Bexley, and
at Bexley. Pottery of this character was made in east Surrey, where
at least one kiln-site is known. Recently Mr. Brian Hope-Taylor
excavated a kiln and potter's workshop at Vicars Haw, Limpsfield,
which produced a mass of jugs, cooking-pots, and bowls with the
characteristics given above.
<head>3. POTTERY FROM WESTERN FRANCE</head>
<head>Polychrome jug (pl. 1b and fig. 4)</head>
   <p>Several fragments of a nearly complete jug, skilfully restored at
the Institute of Archaeology, London. The jug, 10.3 in. high, is
made of thin whitish ware with a thin colourless glaze on the outside
surface. It is of slender pear-shape with retracted foot. The
decoration in free-style is of a bird and a shield on each side, and a
third shield beneath the spout. The figures are outlined in dark
brown; the birds are coloured green and the shields are orange-yellow,
with three bars instead of the more usual two. One bird and two
shields are nearly complete, but the rest of the decoration is
fragmentary.
   <p>The bird and shield design is one of the leading patterns on
polychrome ware. Examples, more or less complete, are known in
England and Wales from London, Stonar, Felixstowe, Cardiff, and
Llantwit Major. The shape of the jug also occurs several times on
jugs from London, Ipswich, Writtle, Canterbury, Old Sarum, Glastonbury
Abbey, and Whichford Castle.
   <p>Since the initial discussion and inventory of polychrome ware in
Archaeologia in 1933, a considerable number of new finds has been
made in Britain. The total number of sites now stands at twenty-five
in England, six in Wales, still one in Scotland, and Ireland (as
predicted in the original paper) can now show three sites. These
additions alone call for a re-evaluation of the material, but even
more significant is the new evidence in France. The kilns of an
intense medieval pottery industry have been discovered at La
Chappelle-des-Pots, a village to the east of Saintes in Charente
Maritime. The manufacture here of polychrome ware and the other types
of pottery also exported from France to England is now an established
fact. It is now possible, therefore, to discuss more fully the trade
in polychrome ware from its centre of production in France, and to
give a more balanced evaluation of its distribution in the British
Isles.
   <p>For the present purpose it must suffice to summarize the evidence
for the date of polychrome ware. This is based on finds made at five
castles, either built by Edward 1, occupied by the English for a
limited period, or where the deposits are related to building periods
of the structure. The castles and the limiting dates are as follows:
<table>
   <p>The gist of this evidence is that at the longest range polychrome
ware dates between 1270 and 1325. In fact the range can be narrowed
down to between 1280 and 1300, since most of the initial and terminal
dates overlap. Although pottery of other types made in the same part
of western France has been found in Britain in contexts both earlier
and later than the above dates, there is no evidence otherwise that
polychrome ware had a longer range in date. The evidence as a whole
suggests that polychrome ware was not only imported but indeed made
during a very short period, and that it was produced in the lifetime
of one or at most two generations of potters.
<head>Glazed pitcher (fig. 5)</head>
   <p>The base and lower half of a pitcher is also identified as an
import from western France. It is made of thin, hard yellow ware with
fine red grit. The surface is smooth and yellow-buff, with patches of
green glaze above the bulge. The base is markedly raised at the
middle.
   <p>The pot belongs to a group well represented at Saintes by
barrel-shaped and ovoid pitchers and jugs. These have a large
bridge-spout and a single strap-handle, as on the polychrome jugs, and
the base is usually hollowed underneath. On some of the jugs the
decoration consists of slip lines in brown or red forming a chevron or
trellis pattern limited to the upper part of the body, as was
evidently the case on the Lesnes Abbey pot. The ware of the pots at
Saintes is sometimes equal in quality to that of the polychromes, and
sometimes more gritty. It is probable, therefore, that these vessels,
of which fragments were found at the kiln-sites at La
Chappelle-des-Pots, were also made elsewhere in the vicinity of
Saintes. A pitcher decorated with a trellis in red slip, in the
Mus&eacute;e Municipal at Saintes, has been used to complete the
drawing of the Lesnes Abbey pot.
<head>4. SPANISH LUSTREWARE (pl. 11 and fig. 6)</head>
   <p>Two fragments of thick whitish ware, glazed and decorated on both
surfaces. The outside is mostly covered by zones of pale amber
lustre, comprising broad and narrow solid bands, sloping panels,
chevrons, and large scrolls. Between the lustre are two narrow bands
painted in cobalt-blue (hatched in the drawing). The smaller fragment
has two concentric mouldings on the outside above the inner blue band;
the inner moulding is more prominent than the outer. On the inside
surface the lustre is fainter, and shows the same range of motifs as
on the outside, also a narrow band of guilloche; no blue bands are
present on the inside.
   <p>The pieces belong to the same vessel, a large cover or lid, 15
3/4 in. in diameter at the rim. At the inner edge of the upper
piece the profile turns sharply upwards for a knob for lifting, as
restored in the drawing.
   <p>The Lesnes Abbey cover is identified as Hispano-Moresque ware
made at Malaga in Andalusia by comparison with numerous fragments, in
the Victoria and Albert Museum, found at Fostat near Cairo. The
origin of this lustre-painted pottery is demonstrated by a foot-ring
from Fostat, inscribed with the Arabic word \Malaga. Such marks
are seldom found on this class of pottery, and may indicate that they
were limited to vessels destined for exportation. A close parallel
for the shape and decoration of the Lesnes Abbey cover is provided by
a large piece of a cover from Fostat (pl. 3a). This is also
decorated on both sides by bands of pale amber lustre, and near the
top are mouldings precisely like those on the Lesnes Abbey cover.
   <p>The shape of these covers is given by a complete cover for a
pedestalled bowl, both painted with arabesque patterns in lustre and
in blue, also in the Victoria and Albert Museum (pl. 3b).

All this, the great corpus of Russian song, remains almost
unknown &mdash; or known by its least fine and subtle examples. And not
only Russian song; Poland has produced at least two remarkable
song-writers, Moniuszko in the last century and Szymanowski in the
present one, of whom Szymanowski is known only in German translations
and Moniuszko not at all, for his songs have never been translated
into English and the wretched French selection is a hundred years old.
   <p>Instrumental music, of course, penetrates the curtain with no
difficulty, with the result that we think of Russian and Polish music
as mainly instrumental. This is a false picture. It is less false, I
think, of Czech music. The Czechs (among whom I include the Moravians
and Slovaks and Ruthenians, beside the Czechs proper) are an intensely
musical people but, whether because they nearly lost their language as
a culture-language under the Habsburg monarchy (so that even Smetana
had to learn it as a foreigner) or from deficiencies in the language
itself (e.g. in vowel-sounds), for some reason their vocal
literature is less rich than their instrumental.
   <p>The language-curtain obstructs much more than the free passage of
Slavonic vocal music. It obstructs our knowledge of a great deal of
music that would present no difficulty at all if we could only hear
it: the older instrumental music of the Czechs and Poles, and their
Latin church music. For &mdash; and here I come at last to the very heart
of my subject &mdash; the Czechs and Poles have always shared the culture of
Western Europe, including its music, whereas the Russians began to do
so only in the second half of the eighteenth century. Not only were
the Russians Christianised from Byzantium, either directly or through
Bulgarian missionaries, and left with a different alphabet, a
different liturgy and a different liturgical language, for two
centuries in the later Middle Ages they suffered under the <squote>Tatar
yoke</squote> and the Princes of Moscow were mere tributaries to Mongol
khans. On the other hand, whatever the penetration of Central Europe
by the old Slavonic liturgy, whatever the nature of the conflict there
between Eastern and Western churches (and on this there are many
important points on which the experts still disagree), whatever the
political vicissitudes of the Western Slav states, they were never
detached in this way from the influences of Western Christendom; the
Roman alphabet conquered the Cyrillic and in the church Latin
conquered Old Slavonic. Polish and Czech chapter and monastery
libraries at Gniezno and Vy&scaron;ebrod possess Gregorian missals from
the eleventh or early twelfth century, and although these no doubt
came from the West &mdash; the Gniezno missal has St. Gall-type neumes &mdash;
manuscripts of Polish and Czech origins were compiled before long.
The Prague Troparium of 1235 is only the earliest of a number of
Czech and Moravian musical codices of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries and the Poles claim the composition of a plainsong antiphon
which can hardly be later than the twelfth century: <squote>Magna vox,
laude sonora</squote> in honour of St. Adalbert, who played such an
important part in the Christianisation (or Romanisation) of both Poles
and Czechs. And there is a significant parallelism in the appearance
of the earliest religious songs with Czech or Polish words; both the
Polish <squote>\Bogurodzica</squote> (Hymn to the Mother of God) and the Czech
<squote>Hospodine, pomiluj ny</squote> (<squote>Lord have mercy on us</squote>, a
vernacular Kyrie) are more or less centos of plainsong motives.
Moreover the earliest preserved sources for both date from the same
period; the oldest known manuscript of the <squote>\Bogurodzica</squote> dates
from about 1407, that of <squote>Hospodine, pomiluj</squote> from just ten
years earlier, though the words are found without the music as early
as c. 1380.
   <p>I have no intention of inflicting on you a potted history of
Western Slavonic music, beginning with the Middle Ages. I wish, by
these facts, only to drive home two points: the essential oneness of
this musical culture with that of Europe generally &mdash; and the
differences. The Western Slavs shared in the common stock but often
drew from it elements which they put to their own special uses.
Standing on the outer edge of Western culture, they developed all the
fascinating peculiarities one expects to find in peripheral cultures.
One finds similar things in the music of Portugal and at some periods
of history in our own. Peripheral cultures naturally tend to be
<squote>backward</squote>; even in a country the size of England, provincial
architecture has often been half-a-century or more behind the style
fashionable in London; as we all know, even Germany was very late in
developing polyphony. But there are wonderful compensations in the
variety, in the range of dialects (as it were). Sometimes political
or other non-musical factors play a part; the Hussite wars of the
fifteenth century gave a tremendous stimulus to vernacular Czech song
just as the two centuries and more of Habsburg domination after the
Battle of the White Mountain overlaid and even seemed to extinguish
the peculiarly Czech elements in the music of Bohemia. But the Slavs
were quite capable of developing special musical characteristics
without the help of extra-musical circumstances. Even in the field of
notation, Czech neumes evolved with certain differences. In the
thirteenth century the Czechs were still using non-diastematic neumes;
in the fourteenth they progressed to the stave &mdash; and their neumes
began to assume peculiar rhomboid forms. But let me remind you again
how much more different things were in Russia, where liturgical
melody had developed &mdash; and developed quite a long way on its own
lines &mdash; from Byzantine chant but was stuck fast in a primitive
notation which is still unreadable up to the late fifteenth century,
although comparative study with Byzantine notation is now showing how
it may be deciphered. As for the five-line stave, it reached the
Ukraine only in the seventeenth century and Russia proper in the
eighteenth. Genuine polyphony was impossible though a very primitive
form of three-part polyphony &mdash; in the so-called troestrochnoe
style, noted in three rows of neumes &mdash; begins to appear about the
middle of the sixteenth century: the liturgical cantus firmus
in the middle part is supported at first in unison or octaves by
upper and lower voices which branch out from it and close in again to
the unison in the manner of the podgoloski of Russian
polyphonic folk-music. It is not until the mid-seventeenth century
that one begins to find four-part polyphony, with the cantus
firmus in the tenor and the added parts in note-against-note style
producing common chords in root position.
   <p>At this period, when Russian liturgical polyphony was in its
earliest infancy and Russian secular music reached no higher level
than the songs and dance music of the skomorokhi (buffoons),
Poland and Bohemia were enjoying what modern Polish and Czech
historians claim as a <squote>golden age of polyphony</squote>. It may at first
strike us as no more than a pale reflection of the golden age that was
being enjoyed at the same time by all Europe, but that is not the
whole truth. A great deal of this music deserves not only intensive
study but performance.
   <p>Two difficulties confront the Western student of this music. One
I have already mentioned: the language curtain. It does not conceal
so much of the music itself, for a great deal of it is Latin church
music, but it makes it difficult for most of us to get at the
information about it, the existing stylistic research, and so on.
Czech and Polish musicology have fairly long traditions and very high
standards, as indeed has Soviet musicology, and the amount of study
devoted to the Western Slav polyphonists &mdash; to say nothing of the
instrumental composers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
and early Czech and Polish romantic piano music &mdash; is enormous. It
exists in print, in books and monographs and learned periodicals, but
it might be in Etruscan or Cretan Linear B for all that most of us can
make of it and it would be well worth the while of some of the young
musicologists now studying Russian to make Polish or Czech their
second Slav language.
   <p>The second difficulty is that of actual scores. It has at times
seemed as if Western Slav musicologists were more interested in
studying their old masters than in getting their texts published.
Josef Syrzy&nacute;ski made an excellent start in 1885 with his Polish
\Monumenta but succeeded in bringing out only four volumes; the
later Polish series, Wydawnictwo dawnej muzyki polskiej,
edited by Chybi&nacute;ski and begun in the 1930s, has produced nearly
forty numbers but many of them are very slim, containing only a single
work or a selection of short pieces. (The editorial prefaces were
from the first provided with a French translation and the post-war
numbers are translated into English, French, German and Russian.) The
somewhat similar Czech series, Musica Antiqua Bohemica, has
been devoted almost entirely to instrumental music of the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; it is only in the last few
years that the Czechs have begun to publish the work of their classic
polyphonists &mdash; with trilingual r&eacute;sum&eacute;s of the prefaces,
but not of the critical apparatus.
   <p>A third difficulty is the paucity of surviving material. Poland
and the Czechoslovak lands have provided innumerable battlefields
during the last four centuries; the Thirty Years War and the two World
Wars were only the worst of a series, and the total destruction of
music, both manuscript and printed, must have been enormous.
(Incidentally, these countries began to print music quite early; a
Czech-printed Catholic \Kancion&aacute;l appeared in 1529 and a Polish
music-publisher, &Lstrok;azarz Andrysowic, was active at Cracow from 1553
onward). One reads of a Polish master such as Wac&lstrok;aw \z
Szamotul &mdash; or Szamotulczyk, as he is often called &mdash; who was obviously
a very considerable figure in the middle of the sixteenth century; two
of his psalm-motets were published by Montanus and Neuber at Nuremberg
in 1554 and in 1564 in collections of works by the leading French and
Netherland masters, and what survives of his music justifies the high
esteem in which he was held. Yet one finds so little that does
survive: these two motets, another preserved only in organ tablature,
some songs with Polish words &mdash; a very small proportion of what he is
known to have written. His eight-part Mass for the wedding of King
Sigismund Augustus is lost; his Office settings are lost; of his
\Lamentationes, printed at Cracow by Andrysowic, only the tenor
part has been preserved. Another, rather later composer Tomasz
Szadek &mdash; a member first of the king's private chapel and later of the
royal chapel of the Rorantists at Cracow, the two chief centres of the
Polish <squote>golden age</squote> &mdash; survives in only two works, other than
fragments, and of those two Masses one lacks the Agnus.
   <p>Technically these works are more or less in the <squote>late
Netherland</squote> style. What distinguishes them and gives them special
interest is the infusion of Polish melodic elements, here a phrase
from a Polish devotional song, there a pseudo-plainsong found only in
Polish sources. Marcin Leopolita, composer and organist to the king
in the early 1560s, composed a five-part Missa paschalis or
Missa de resurrectione, the earliest complete setting of the
Ordinary by a Polish composer that has come down to us, which is based
on four Easter songs current in Poland and Germany.
   <p>The Polish <squote>golden age</squote> was finally submerged by a flood of
Italian musicians brought in by Sigismund 3. There had of course
been foreign musicians at the Polish court before; Heinrich Finck was
a chorister in the royal chapel in his youth and returned there for
fourteen years, perhaps as director, from 1492 to 1506. And there had
been Italian musical influence. But Sigismund 3 was a fanatic for
the Counter-Reformation and for everything Italian; he moved his court
from Cracow to Warsaw, enticed Marenzio to go there (but failed to
keep him), invited Giovanni Gabrieli (also in vain) and appointed a
whole series of Italians as directors of his chapel, including
Asprilio Pacelli, an ancestor of the late Pope (Pius 12), and
Giovanni Francesco Anerio.

<text id=LOBJ69>
   <p>On differentiation, each reverts to the other:
&formula;
   <p>and
&formula;
   <p>The hyperbolic tangent, , is &formula;
and, starting at zero, never exceeds unity, however large t
may become.

   <p>The remaining three hyperbolic functions, sech, cosech and
coth, are the reciprocals of the above three ratios respectively.
Fig. 1.4 shows the whole family of curves.
   <p>Tables of the hyperbolic functions are available, but are not so
readily available as those of the circular functions. A device by
which the more extensive circular function tables may be used in
conjunction with a subsidiary table (the Gudermannian) is described in
Appendix 2.
   <p>The general case, where the time constants of the two exponential
terms are not the same, may be expressed as the product of another
exponential and a hyperbolic function. Thus:
&formula;
   <p>If a is positive, this expression will always diverge.

   <p>If a is negative (with b positive), the final value will
always be zero, and this is the more usual in practice. Fig. 1.5(a)
shows the result of the sum of two negative exponentials, and Fig.
1.5(b) the difference. The second is seen to start at zero, reach a
maximum, and then decay. As Sallust remarked: ~Omnia orta occidunt
et aucta secuntur, or ~<squote>Everything rises but to fall and increases
but to decay</squote>. The time at which the maximum is reached is easily
found to be
&formula;
   <p>and there is a point of inflexion where
&formula;
   <p>This type of curve is encountered, for example, in radioactive
cases where a substance A decays into another substance B,
which, in turn decays into a stable end-product C. The curve
shows how the amount of the second substance varies with time.
<head>Intuitive estimation of transients</head>
   <p>A demonstration will now be given of how the transient current
resulting from switching operations may be obtained in simple cases,
without resort to mathematics (or very little). The following
plausible assumptions are made:
   <p>1. That an uncharged capacitor behaves as a short circuit at the
instant of applying a steady p.d.; and after a long time, when
fully charged, acts as a disconnexion or infinite impedance.
   <p>2. That a pure (resistanceless) inductance behaves in the opposite
way; offering apparently infinite impedance at the instant of
application of the direct voltage, and short circuit after a long
time &mdash; that is, when the current is steady.
   <p>3. That, in the interim period, the current changes according to a
simple exponential law; the time constant of which is either RC or
L/R, where R, L or C may be simple or compound.
   <p>4. That there can be no discontinuous jumps in either the voltage
across a capacitor or the current in an inductor.
   <p>The magnetic space constant m<hi>0</hi> (otherwise the
permeability of free space) has dimensions henry&sol; metre, and the
electric space constant, or permittivity of free space, e<hi>0</hi>,
farad&sol; metre. The square root of the reciprocal of the product of
these two, therefore, has the dimensions of velocity and this is the
velocity of electro-magnetic waves, c, equal to 299792 km/
sec, according to the latest evidence. It follows that 
has dimensions of time, and  dimensions of resistance.
In fact,  is the well-known expression for the
characteristic impedance of a loss-free transmission line.
   <p>From this it is seen that L/R and CR both have
dimensions of time, and this time is the time constant. Any time
constants we may encounter in the study of transients must be in the
form of a certain inductance divided by a certain resistance, or a
capacitance multiplied by a resistance, or else the square root of the
product of an inductance and a capacitance. No other combinations are
possible.
   <p>Let a simple series LR circuit be suddenly connected to a
constant voltage source V, at time t = 0. The initial current
will be zero and after the transient has subsided will be V/R.
At first sight, this is not a decaying exponential; it decays
upwards, so to speak. It may be easier to consider the voltage across
the (pure) inductance L. The initial voltage across this part of
the circuit is equal to V, and the final value will be zero.
Using the assumptions made above, the voltage across L in the
transient period will be
&formula;
   <p>and, because there are only two circuit elements, T is
obviously equal to L/R.
   <p>The voltage V<hi>R</hi> across the resistive part of the
circuit when added to V<hi>L</hi> must always give V, hence
&formula;
   <p>and the current in R (and also L, of course) is
&formula;
   <p>the well-known result of a problem which is often given to
beginners as an exercise in solving differential equations of the
first order.
   <p>By similar reasoning, the current through a CR series circuit
is found to be
&formula;
   <p>The voltage across the resistor is
&formula; and that across the capacitor is, therefore,
&formula;, and so the charge in the capacitor at time t is
&formula;
   <p>Theoretically, the current never does reach its final value;
the <squote>final value</squote> may be said to be attained when it falls short of
the theoretical final value by an amount too small to be detected by
the measuring instrument in use, or, in decay, when it has reached the
r.m.s. value of the noise level.
   <p>For practical purposes, and as a rough guide, the current will
have reached within one per cent of the final value in a time five
times the length of the time constant (see p. 2). This is roughly
seven times as long as the half-life of radioactivity. One cannot
help feeling that, subconsciously or not, people who think in terms of
half-life have the idea that all activity will have ceased in about
twice that time.
<head>Three-element circuits</head>
   <p>It may well be argued at this point that the above type of
reasoning is all very well for simple two-element circuits, but would
fail if carried further. Let us consider, therefore, the circuit of
Fig. 1.6 in which the capacitor C has a leakage resistance
R<hi>2</hi>.

   <p>The initial current on making the switch (t = 0) is
V/R<hi>1</hi>, and the final current will be
&formula;. This fixes the limits between which the current must
vary exponentially.
   <p>The time constant of this exponential must be the product of a
capacitance and a resistance. The capacitance is obviously C, but
what are we to take as the resistance? The answer is, that resistance
which effectively appears across the terminals of C when the
switch is closed; this is clearly R<hi>1</hi> and R<hi>2</hi> in
parallel, the voltage source having no internal resistance. So
the time-constant is
&formula;
   <p>and we can now sketch the current&sol; time curve as in Fig. 1.7.
The exponential part is
&formula;
   <p>and to this must be added
&formula;; after a little manipulation the current can be written
&formula;
   <p>The final capacitor voltage
&formula; will be &formula;, and its
variation with time is
&formula;
   <p>The case of two capacitors and one resistor is amenable to
similar treatment, though not quite so easily (see Fig. 1.8). Here
there is a little awkwardness due to the fact that the initial rush of
current is very high; theoretically infinite but lasting for zero time
(see under <squote>Delta Function</squote> in the next chapter). We shall
side-step the current question and work, instead, in terms of voltage
or quantity of charge, neither of which becomes infinite.
   <p>When the switch is made, the capacitors immediately charge up to
&formula; and &formula;
volts respectively, and the quantity of
charge on the plates of each is &formula;
coulombs.
   <p>Because of the presence of the resistance, C<hi>1</hi> will
discharge exponentially, with T =  while
C<hi>2</hi>, following its initial charge at time t = 0, will
acquire further charge until its p.d. reaches the source voltage,
V, and it holds C<hi>2</hi>V coulombs.
   <p>Hence: charge in C<hi>1</hi>
&formula;
   <p>and charge in C<hi>2</hi>
&formula;
   <p>The current taken from the supply, which is the same as that in
C<hi>2</hi> may be found by differentiating
&formula; with respect to time and is
&formula;
   <p>plus, of course, the initial pulse of current. See p. 43,
equation (2.8).
   <p>Circuits comprising R, C and L are, in general, beyond
this simple intuitive treatment, though there are exceptions. One of
these is shown in Fig. 1.9 where a constant voltage source, V,
is applied to two elementary circuits, LR<hi>1</hi> and CR<hi>2</hi>
respectively.

   <p>We shall suppose that the two time constants are the same;
L/R<hi>1</hi> = CR<hi>2</hi> or R<hi>1</hi>R<hi>2</hi> = L/C. The
initial current i<hi>0</hi> will be V/R<hi>2</hi> and the final
current,
&formula; will be V/R<hi>1</hi>. Thus, during the transient
period, the current will be switched over from the capacitive side to
the inductive side at a rate governed by the common time constant.
   <p>Alternatively, we can make use of results already obtained on
p. 9 and write down the supply current immediately as
&formula;
   <p>In the special case where R<hi>1</hi> = R<hi>2</hi> = R, the
term containing the exponential vanishes, so there is no transient and
the current taken from the supply is constant and equal to V/R.
In other words, the network is distortionless and free from phase
shift for all frequencies; provided always that R =
.
<head>Analogies</head>
   <p>In the elementary teaching of electricity use is often made of
analogies with mechanical systems. Electricity seems to be more
difficult to understand than mechanics for most people, because the
mind can readily picture mechanical processes, but electrical
phenomena require the effort of abstract thought. As the
understanding develops, the debt can be repaid, often with much
interest, as problems in mechanical engineering are referred to their
electrical counterparts for solution; an example of this is in the
theory of vibrations, both free and forced.
   <p>The analogue of electro-motive force, E, is force, F, or
mechano-motive force as it has been called: that which moves
mechanical systems or particles, the unit being the newton; though
it is only fair to say that this unit is making but slow progress into
mechanical circles. The magnetic circuit analogue, magneto-motive
force, is not so good since, although we speak of flux, there is
nothing which actually flows. In angular motion the equivalent is
torque, T<hi>q</hi>, measured in newton . metre or joule&sol; radian.
   <p>Electric current has its analogue in velocity &mdash; linear, v, or
angular, o, and consequently quantity of charge, the time-integral
of current, corresponds to linear displacement x, or angular
displacement th.
   <p>Mass (kilogram) or moment of inertia (kilogram . metre<hi>2</hi>) is
analogous to inductance. It is noteworthy that while there has never
been any confusion in the mind of the electrician between
electro-motive force and self-inductance, the tyro mechanician often

himself with <squote>big pounds</squote> and <squote>little pounds</squote> as well as

The terms mechanical ohm and rotational ohm are used by Olson, but
these seem rather far-fetched, particularly as they are referred to
c.g.s. and not practical units.

<head>General Properties of Ferrites</head>
<head>2.1 FERRITE STRUCTURE</head>
   <p>APART from ferromagnetic metals, a number of chemical
compounds (e.g. ferrites, garnets, plumbites and perovskites)
exhibit ferromagnetic properties. Of these compounds ferrites have to
date proved to be the most important from the standpoint of microwave
applications. As the majority of ferrites crystallise with a cubic
structure, similar to the mineral spinel, (magnesium aluminate
&formula;, the term ferromagnetic
spinel is sometimes used to describe those ferrites which exhibit
magnetic properties.
   <p>The general chemical formula of a ferrite is
&formula; where M represents a metallic cation. It
is found that a spinel crystal structure is only formed if the ionic
radius of the cation M is less than about 1 A&ring;. If it is
greater than 1 A&ring; then the electrostatic Coulomb forces are
insufficient to ensure the stability of the crystal. For example
Ca<hi>++</hi> (ionic radius 1.06 A&ring;) does not form spinel crystals,
while Mn<hi>++</hi> (ionic radius 0.91 A&ring;) does. The cation M is
generally divalent, but other valencies are possible if the number of
anions is doubled, e.g. lithium ferrite
&formula;. The ions forming ferrites
of practical importance are Ni<hi>++</hi>, Mn<hi>++</hi>, Fe<hi>++</hi>,
Co<hi>++</hi>, Cu<hi>++</hi>, Zn<hi>++</hi>, Cd<hi>++</hi>, Li<hi>+</hi>, Mg<hi>++</hi>.
   <p>The spinel unit cell (see Fig. 2.1) consists of a close packed
cubic array of 32 oxygen anions, between which there are 96 spaces or
interstices, 24 of which are filled with a cation, the remaining 72
being empty. The sites occupied by the cations are of two kinds known
as tetrahedral or A sites and octahedral or B sites. The A
sites of which eight are occupied, are surrounded by four oxygen
anions and the B sites of which sixteen are occupied, are
surrounded by six oxygen anions. When the chemical formula is
written, the ions in the B sites are often enclosed in brackets to
indicate their position, e.g. Fe(NiFe)O<hi>4</hi> for nickel
ferrite.
   <p>It might seem at first sight that the most likely arrangement of
the cations would be with M<hi>++</hi> ions on the A sites and
Fe<hi>2</hi><hi>+++</hi> ions on the B sites but in practice three types
of spinel can be distinguished.

   <p>(1) Normal spinels in which M<hi>++</hi> ions occupy the A
sites and Fe<hi>2</hi><hi>+++</hi> the B sites.
   <p>(2) Inverse spinels in which M<hi>++</hi> ions occupy the B
sites together with half the Fe<hi>+++</hi> ions, the other half being
on the A sites.
   <p>(3) Random spinels in which both M<hi>++</hi> ions and Fe<hi>+++</hi>
ions occur on the A and B sites.

   <p>The preference of certain ions for A or B sites is of
importance, as it is found that in general normal ferrite spinels are
paramagnetic while inverse spinels are ferromagnetic. Many ions show
no strong preference for a particular site, this being especially true
for those ions with a noble gas configuration such as Li<hi>+</hi>,
Mg<hi>++</hi>, Al<hi>+++</hi> and also those with a half-filled 3d
electron shell e.g. Fe<hi>+++</hi>Mn<hi>++</hi>. Where there is no
strong site preference the most stable cation distribution can be
calculated from a static model of charged spheres. Of the remaining
ions in ferrites which are of microwave interest Zn<hi>++</hi>, has a
preference for A sites while only Ni<hi>+++</hi> and Cr<hi>+++</hi>
have a strong preference for B sites.
   <p>When two or more cations are present, the distribution of ions
with weak site preference may be affected by the presence of an ion
with a strong site preference.
   <p>Most ferrite spinels can form solid solutions with each other in
any proportion. This arises since there is a greater probability of a
solid solution when two ferrite spinels are reacted together, than
there is of the formation of separate crystals of the two spinels. A
well-known example of a solid solution is nickel zinc ferrite,
&formula;, where a can take any
value between 0 and 1.
   <p>Unless great care is taken in the manufacture, the final ferrite
formed is not exactly that corresponding to the proportions of raw
materials used. This is because most ferrites can take up oxides into
solution without forming a second phase and thus give rise to
non-stoichiometric ferrite. In particular the ability of most
ferrites to take up Fe<hi>2</hi>O<hi>3</hi> in solution is important. In
the preparation of ferrites the component oxides are reacted at high
temperatures. During this sintering process there is a tendency for
most ferrites to give off oxygen, as the equilibrium pressure in this
reaction is often greater than one atmosphere and increases rapidly
with temperature. This gives rise to an oxygen deficiency in the
final product and to the formation of ferrous ions. The presence of
ferrous ions in microwave ferrites is undesirable however, since it
causes increased dielectric and magnetic loss as is discussed in this
chapter and Chapter 4. For this reason, compounds are often made iron
deficient, great care being taken to avoid loss of oxygen during
sintering.
<head>2.2. PREPARATION OF FERRITES</head>
   <p>Ferrites are prepared by a ceramic technique which involves
sintering the component oxides at temperatures between 1000&deg; and
1450&deg;C. The stages in the preparation of ferrites are listed
below: &mdash;

   <p>Raw materials
   <p>&darr;
   <p>Decomposition to oxide
   <p>&darr;
   <p>Milling
   <p>&darr;
   <p>Presintering (partial reaction)
   <p>&darr;
   <p>Remilling
   <p>&darr;
   <p>Pressing and Extruding to shape
   <p>&darr;
   <p>Final sintering
   <p>&darr;
   <p>Grinding to shape

   <p>A number of raw materials can be used in the manufacture of
ferrites; these include oxides, carbonates, oxylates and nitrates.
The last three compounds decompose to oxides on heat treatment, and
are thus prepared in situ at a temperature near to that at
which solid state reactions commence. This process should favour the
formation of good quality homogeneous materials. For example in the
case of MgMn ferrites it has been reported that the use of nitrates
gives rise to better microwave properties. An explanation is that the
high decomposition temperature of the nitrates and the presence of
nitrogen oxides help to prevent the formation of ferrous ions during
the sintering process.
   <p>The raw materials are first milled, usually in a steel ball mill,
to give a homogeneous mixture of very fine particles. The process is
generally carried out with the raw materials in a slurry of methylated
spirit or any other liquid which is easily removed after milling. The
evaporation of the methylated spirit is carried out rapidly to avoid
any heavier particles separating out.
   <p>The mixture of raw materials is then pre-fired at a temperature
some 200&deg;C below its final firing temperature. This process causes
partial reaction of the constituents and helps to reduce shrinkage
during final sintering. The presintered powder is then remilled. Two
methods of moulding the powder into shape prior to the final sintering
are commonly employed; die pressing and extrusion. For die pressing a
small quantity of binder is added to the powder so that when the
sample has been pressed to shape, it can be handled relatively easily.
To avoid the possibility of contamination of the sintered ferrite,
distilled water has been used as a binder, although for certain shapes
(e.g. rods) organic wax emulsions have been found more
satisfactory. Gentle heating to remove the binder is necessary as
violent volatilisation could cause the sample to crack. A moulding
pressure of between 2 and 10 tons&sol; sq. in. ensures a uniform end
product without the risk of forming laminates in the pressed sample.
   <p>For satisfactory extrusion a higher percentage of binder is
required than for moulding. A solution of wax in petroleum has been
used as a binder for extrusion and by careful choice of extrusion
orifice very dense samples may be produced. As high a density as 99%
has been achieved under special conditions. Extruded samples, in
general, however are not as dense or uniform as those produced by
die-pressing. The principal use of extrusion techniques has been for
the manufacture of long thin rods, a shape often required in microwave
applications. Rods as long as 12in. x 0.04 in. diameter have been
produced by this method.
   <p>The properties of the final product depend critically on the
sintering process and the closest control of sintering time,
temperature and atmosphere is required. Generally, the sintering
process is carried out at a temperature between 1000&deg; and 1450&deg;C
for between 4 hours and 24 hours, depending on the ferrite. Ferrites
containing lithium and cadmium are usually sintered at lower
temperatures due to the volatility of LiO and CdO<hi>2</hi> while
those containing nickel, cobalt and magnesium are sintered at the
highest temperatures. By sintering for a long time at high
temperatures, a uniform final product with a minimum of air pores can
be obtained. The near absence of pores is a requirement for certain
microwave ferrites. This is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3.
As already mentioned, however, the oxygen equilibrium pressure
increases rapidly with increasing temperatures and this sets a limit
on the maximum sintering temperature that can be used without
reduction of ferric iron to ferrous iron.
   <p>The porosity of a particular polycrystalline ferrite sample is
usually quoted with reference to its X-ray or single-crystal density.
The X-ray density is determined from measurements of the spinel
lattice constant and Table 2.1 gives values for a number of commonly
used ferrites, for which the lattice constants are known. The density
of typical polycrystalline pressed samples is between 80% and 95% of
X-ray density, though figures as high as 99% have been achieved.
   <p>During sintering, shrinkage of the ferrite sample occurs. This
may be controlled by careful preparation and by ensuring a uniform
temperature over the sample, although the final shape may not have the
tolerances required in practice. Sintered ferrites, being ceramic in
nature, require special methods of shaping. Cutting can be carried
out by use of a thin diamond slitting wheel or by use of an ultrasonic
machine with a knife edge cutting head. An accurate finish can then
be obtained by surface grinding with a carborundum wheel.
   <p>The growth of single crystals of ferrite was originally of
interest mainly to the physicist, as the crystals produced were too
small for use in microwave applications. However, the development of
non-linear devices employing small single-crystal samples has modified
this situation, although they are still extensively used for the study
of the fundamental properties of ferrites.
   <p>Two principal methods have been used for the formation of single
crystals; the borax melt and the flame fusion process.
   <p>In the borax melt process, the constituent oxides of the ferrite
are dissolved in a flux of molten borax by heating the mixture to
between 1300&deg; and 1400&deg;C and maintaining this temperature for
several hours. The melt is then cooled at a few degrees per hour
until crystals start to form, or alternatively the flux is evaporated
at a constant rate. A disadvantage of the method is that the borax
vapour evolved is very corrosive and destroys most refractory
materials, which necessitates the use of special furnace equipment.
Crystals of linear dimensions of about 1 cm can be obtained by this
method.
   <p>In the flame-fusion process constituent oxides are mixed in the
correct proportions and sprinkled into an oxy-hydrogen flame.
Crystals of reasonable length, e.g. 1-2 cm can then be grown
on a refractory rod held in the flame. It is, however, very difficult
to control the exact chemical composition of the crystal obtained by
the flame-fusion process.
<head>2.3 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF FERRITES</head>
   <p>The purpose of the following section is to provide an
elementary account of the magnetic properties of ferrites, together
with enough background material to enable the reader to place the
section in perspective. It is stressed that since the object is to
equip the microwave user of ferrites with a knowledge of their
magnetic properties, the finer details of the subject must be sought
in the bibliography provided.
   <p>Consideration will first be given to the origin of magnetism in
electrons, atoms and ions, choosing as examples of the latter,
elements which occur in ferrites. The mechanisms of para-, ferro- and
ferri-magnetism will then be explained and reference made to the
temperature behaviour of the saturation magnetisation of certain
ferrites. In ferrites, one is principally concerned with the
phenomenon of ferrimagnetism which will be treated in greater detail.

<text id=LOBJ71>
<head>5.5. VARIATION OF MATERIAL STRENGTH</head>
   <p>Two alloys of widely different strengths from HE30-WP were
selected in order to study the effect of material properties on strut
behaviour. The alloys were NE6-M and HE15-WP, which have 0.1% proof
stresses of approximately 10 tons&sol; in<hi>2</hi> and 28 tons&sol; in<hi>2</hi>
respectively. The specimens were fabricated from 3 in. x 2 1/4
in. x 0.15 in. (76.2 x 57.15 x 3.81 mm) A.D.A. unequal
bulb angle section, and were of the same design as for the first
series of A.D.A. specimens shown in Fig. 13.
   <p>As material failure might be expected to have the greatest
influence on strut behaviour in the lower slenderness ratios, these
specimens were made in a limited range of slenderness ratios only: 30
to 60 for the HE15-WP and 30-90 for the NE6-M.
   <p>The overall picture of failure behaviour was similar to that for
the previous sets of specimens &mdash; torsion-flexure. Failure of the
higher strength material specimens was generally of an elastic
buckling nature, with torsional and flexural deflections starting near
the ultimate load and growing very rapidly to large magnitudes, when
no further increase in load could be sustained. On unloading, there
was almost complete recovery, showing that the buckling was largely
elastic. An exception was one of the L/k = 40 specimens where
the torsional deflection was increased so much that local collapse
occurred in the lower third of the specimen.
   <p>The lower strength specimens generally failed quite suddenly,
with very little deflection visible beforehand. Failure was of the
torsion-flexure form, with flexure more predominant than in the tests
previously described, coupled in all cases below L/k = 50 with
local failure of the outstanding bulbed edge of the individual angle
member. There was scarcely any recovery on unloading, showing that
the distortion had given rise to large areas of plasticity. The forms
of specimens of the two materials after failure for slenderness ratios
30, 40 and 50 are shown in Fig. 33, where the large permanent set of
the NE6-M specimens can be clearly seen, and compared with the almost
complete recovery of the HE15-WP ones. The right-hand specimen of the
middle pair is the exceptional case of local collapse in the HE15-WP
series referred to above. Fig. 34 shows the L/k = 90 specimen
in NE6-M after failure.
   <p>The results of this series of tests are given in Table 16 and
Fig. 35 shows the strengths of the two series of specimens compared
with those for the HE30-WP. It will be noticed that the results for
NE6-M are presented in two parts:


this is because a second batch of material for these specimens had an
appreciably higher strength than the first.
<head>5.6. DETERMINATION OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES</head>
   <p>Tension specimens were taken from each different batch of
section. In some cases machined round specimens of 0.282 in.
(7.16 mm) diameter were made from the corner of the section or
from the bulbed edge, in others standard flat specimens were made from
the longer leg of the section. Strains were measured with a 1 in.
(25.4 mm) gauge length Robertson optical extensometer on the
round specimens, and with a Gerard extensometer on the flat ones. To
make a satisfactory compression test, the length of the specimen
should not exceed about 2 1/2 times its diameter; therefore the length
of compression specimens taken from small structural sections must be
small. As the greatest diameter of specimen that could be obtained
from the

3 in. x 2 1/4 in. (76.2 x 57.15 mm) A.D.A. Section
was about 3/8 in. (9.5 mm) the length was limited to 1 in.
(25.4 mm). A jig was made in which the specimen was clamped and
both ends could be ground at one setting, so that they were finished
accurately flat and parallel. Strains were measured by a pair of
Martens extensometers having a gauge length of 0.6 in. (15.24
mm). The test was carried out in parallel platen apparatus to
ensure, as far as possible, that compression took place without
bending. The results are summarised in Table 17.
   <p>It will be noticed that where test pieces were taken from both
the bulb and corner and from the flat part of the section, the
material in the flat part of the section had an appreciably lower
tensile proof strength.
   <p>The Young's moduli are generally of the order of 5% higher in
compression than in tension. Observations of this nature have been
recorded before with aluminium alloy but no satisfactory explanation
seems to have been offered.
<table>
<head>6. Analysis of Results</head>
   <p>The analysis of the results falls naturally into three
categories: the comparison of values of failing stress predicted
analytically with those obtained experimentally: a similar comparison
of the results obtained from standard design methods; and a study of
the behaviour of double angle struts having different cross-sectional
profiles.
<head>6.1. PREDICTION OF FAILURE</head>
   <p>The prediction of the elastic buckling load of members where
there is interaction between the flexural and torsional modes has been
fully dealt with by Timoshenko and many other authors.
   <p>For members having one axis of symmetry, the critical load is
given by the smallest root of the equation:
&formula;
   <p>where p<hi>1</hi>, p<hi>2</hi>, p<hi>3</hi>, are respectively the
critical stresses for flexural buckling about the principal axis x-x
at right angles to the axis of symmetry, flexural buckling about the
axis of symmetry a-a, and torsional buckling. The value of r
is given by
&formula;
   <p>where a is the distance between the shear centre and the
centroid, and k<hi>x</hi> and k<hi>a</hi> are the respective principal
radii of gyration.
   <p>The exact analysis of the buckling of built-up members such as
those considered here is extremely complex, but provided the
individual members are fastened together at a sufficient number of
points it is justifiable, as a first approximation, to treat the
members as being homogeneous.
   <p>In the case of the struts used in this investigation the bending
stiffnesses about the two principal axes are approximately equal;
therefore, as the member is effectively fixed-ended for buckling about
the x-x axis, p<hi>1</hi> will always be greatly in excess of
the actual buckling stress, and may be disregarded. The stiffness for
bending about the axis of symmetry is taken as the reduced value
calculated in 4.1. The value of the torsional stiffness used in
calculating the torsional buckling load is obtained for the various
slenderness ratios by multiplying by the appropriate factor b from
Table 11. The warping stiffness of the angle sections themselves,
which is very low, has very little effect on the torsional buckling
load and is neglected in the calculation.
   <p>Thus the torsional buckling stress
&formula;,
   <p>where GJ is the free-ended torsional stiffness of the
composite member, and I<hi>p</hi> is the polar second moment of area
of the cross-section about the shear centre.
   <p>The values obtained for the buckling stresses are shown below in
Table 18.
   <p>Fig. 36 shows these values graphically, curve (1), and those
for the HE30-WP struts (2).
   <p>The immediate observation is that the experimental failing stress
curve lies well below the theoretical one, the discrepancy being most
marked in the lower slenderness ratios. The most obvious explanation
for this is the reduction of the effective stiffness due to inadequate
rigidity of the fastenings, discussed in 4.1. If the experimental
results were re-plotted on a basis of slenderness ratios calculated
from actual stiffness, then the curve would be moved to the right.
Some confirmation of this explanation is given
<table>
by the results for the few tests with the knife-edge along the x-x
axis, in which the effects of the fastenings on flexural buckling
might be expected to be much smaller, which lie much nearer to the
theoretical curve.
   <p>It is interesting to re-calculate the torsion-flexure buckling
stress values when the flexural buckling stress is derived from that
obtained by taking the measured bending stiffness, the torsional
stiffness remaining as before. These values are plotted in curve (3),
Fig. 36, which lies much closer to the experimental values of curve
(2) than does the original theoretical torsion-flexure curve.

   <p>On the other hand, it might be argued that compression should
tend to reduce the effects of bolt clearances and that the discrepancy
between the experimental and theoretical values might be due to
plasticity of the material at the higher stresses. From the
compression stress-strain curve of the HE30-WP material used, values
of the tangent modulus may be deduced, and the Engesser plastic
flexural buckling curve can be constructed, curve (4), as a
continuation of the Euler curve for the elastic range. This curve
diverges rapidly from the Euler and elastic torsion-flexure curves as
the slenderness ratio diminishes. The limit of proportionality of the
HE30-WP was just below 8 tons&sol; in<hi>2</hi> (12.7 kg&sol; mm<hi>2</hi>),
and it might be expected that after the critical stress of this value,
which occurs at about L/k = 70, the true torsion-flexure buckling
curve would begin to diverge from the elastic one. There is no direct
method of constructing the plastic torsion-flexure buckling curve.
However, by assuming that the critical load for the torsional mode
does not change, which is reasonable if the shear modulus remains
nearly constant, it is possible to devise a method of successive
approximation.
   <p>Taking for the flexural buckling stress, p<hi>2</hi>, the value
obtained for flexural plastic buckling, a new value can be obtained
for the torsion-flexure buckling stress p. From the compression
stress-strain curve the value of the tangent modulus E<hi>t</hi> at
the stress p is obtained. Using this value of E<hi>t</hi> in the
Engesser equation, &formula;, the buckling
stress of a strut of the same slenderness ratio can be calculated.
This value will generally be found to differ from the value chosen
for p<hi>2</hi>. Another value is now chosen for p<hi>2</hi>, and the
process repeated until a value is obtained, for the plastic
torsion-flexure buckling stress, at which the value for the tangent
modulus corresponds to plastic flexural buckling at the chosen value
of p<hi>2</hi>. The values obtained by this method are shown in
Fig. 36, curve (5), where it will be seen that, except for
slenderness ratios below 40, the curve lies above the experimental
one &mdash; between those obtained from the elastic torsion-flexure equation
using modified flexural stiffness and the ordinary elastic
torsion-flexure equation. It may be concluded that both plasticity
and loss of expected stiffness contribute to the divergence of the
experimental from the predicted values.
   <p>Confirmation of this is obtained by examination of the results
for HE15-WP and NE6-M materials; the elastic limit of HE15-WP is about
23 tons&sol; in<hi>2</hi> so that, as the critical stress for elastic
torsion-flexural buckling at L/k = 30 is 23.1 tons&sol; in<hi>2</hi>,
it might be expected that plasticity would have scarcely any influence
on failure in the range of slenderness ratios used in the tests.
Fig. 37 shows that the experimental values are in reasonable
agreement with the values obtained from the elastic torsion-flexure
equation with modified flexural stiffness. The small discrepancy at
the lower slenderness ratios could be attributed to an over-estimation
of the torsional stiffness. The NE6-M alloy, with an elastic limit of
between 4 and 5 tons&sol; in<hi>2</hi>, gives the opposite picture in that
plasticity affects failure over the whole range of slenderness ratios
considered. The plastic torsion-flexure curve, in Fig. 37, lies
well below the elastic values

and a little above the experimental ones. This seems to indicate
that, although plasticity is the dominating factor affecting failure,
the reduced flexural stiffness contributes to the difference between
experimental and predicted values, and the best prediction might be
obtained from the plastic torsion-flexure approach using the reduced,
experimental flexural stiffnesses. The results of this calculation
for HE30-WP and NE6-M are shown in Fig. 38, where it will be

seen that good agreement is obtained except at the lowest slenderness
ratio where the stiffnesses have probably been over estimated.
<head>6.2. DESIGN METHODS</head>
   <p>As the mode of failure at all slenderness ratios up to 150 was
torsion-flexure it is evident that direct design from the
Perry-Robertson strut curve is unsatisfactory. Forms of compression
instability, other than purely flexural, may be dealt with by the
Equivalent Slenderness Ratio (e.s.r.) method.

<text id=LOBJ72>
<head>SUMMARY</head>
   <p>The authors discuss the testing of explosives with special
reference to the ability of a test to indicate the presence of
significant differences in ignition probability and also to the
reliability of the test. It is suggested that tests requiring low
ignition rates, and particularly no-ignition tests, are, as a class,
poor discriminators.
   <p>The ability to discriminate can be increased by increasing the
number of ignitions accepted as the pass level. It is suggested that
a test of 26 shots, in which 13 ignitions are permitted, represents a
good compromise, in view of the need to keep the number of shots
within reasonable limits.
<head>1. INTRODUCTION</head>
   <p>About a hundred million shots a year are fired in British mines
and usually about 6 ignitions are reported each year. It is clear
that with a practical ignition rate of roughly 10<hi>-7</hi>, a test no
more severe than practical use required an impossibly high number of
shots to give a reliable answer; and therefore the test must be made
so much more severe (i.e. the ignition rate in the test must be
made so much higher) that an effective assessment of the safety of an
explosive may be made with a practicable number of shots.
   <p>In rigorous terms this thesis demands that the ignition rate be
multiplied ten million times or so. The multiplying factor can be
made up by

   <p>(1) Ensuring the presence of practical conditions which are
dangerous but rare, e.g. the presence of considerable volumes of
an explosive mixture of methane&sol; air, the absence of stemming in the
shothole, and so on.
   <p>(2) Modifying the test apparatus to increase the ignition rate,
e.g. firing the shot in a steel cannon instead of the rock or
coal in which it is fired in the mine.

   <p>All of these devices are used in explosives testing; but apart
from some tentative results recorded in the literature (Cybulski,
1959; Schultze-Rhonhof and others, 1959) no firm estimate can be made
of the relative contributions they make to the multiplying factor.
However it is probably wise to assume that the contribution of the
second group is substantial rather than preponderant. This is
fortunate rather than the reverse because scientifically any process
that extrapolates a million times may be expected to require a lot of
proving.
   <p>British approval tests have been such that an explosive is failed
if ignitions are obtained in any of the tests. This reliance on
no-ignition tests has been an almost uniform feature of explosive
testing throughout the world although the French system permits
ignitions in one of the tests, and recently the United States Bureau
of Mines has made a decided break with tradition in this regard
(United States Bureau of Mines, 1961).
   <p>For the past three years a detailed study of the testing
procedure has been conducted at S.M.R.E.; particular attention
has been paid to the statistical problems raised by no-ignition tests.
It has been concluded that the no-ignition test, as applied to
explosives, gives too little information about the ignition
probability of the material tested, and that this weakness cannot be
removed by any practicable increase in the number of shots fired.
<head>2. RELIABILITY AND DISCRIMINATION</head>
   <p>A good test should meet, inter alia, two requirements:

   <p>(1) It should be reliable, i.e. a repeat test of the same
material should give the same result.
   <p>(2) It should have adequate discrimination, i.e. it
should indicate the presence of significant differences.

   <p>No measurement is exactly reproducible, since all are subject to
random errors. In explosive testing random error appears as a
variation in the number of ignitions obtained in repeated tests on
identical material. However often a trial is repeated, one can never
say how many ignitions will take place; but, at the same time, the
more often a trial is repeated, the more exactly can the probability
of ignition by an individual shot be stated. Once this probability of
ignition by an individual shot is known it becomes possible to
calculate the probability of any particular number of ignitions in a
given number of shots. Alternatively, it is possible to calculate the
number of shots that must be fired to achieve a given probability of a
particular number of ignitions.
   <p>In this situation, complete reliability of acceptance or
rejection is impossible; one may assign only the probability with
which material of specified characteristics shall be accepted or
rejected. This probability can, by firing enough shots, be made to
approach certainty as closely as is desired, although a situation is
rapidly reached where an enormous number of shots must be fired to
achieve a small improvement.
   <p>It is also fundamental that the acceptance and rejection limits
cannot be equal although, again, by firing enough shots they may be
made to approach each other as closely as is desired. The difference
between the acceptance and rejection levels is analogous to
discrimination.
   <p>Whatever values of ignition probability are chosen as the
rejection and acceptance limits and whatever level of probability be
chosen for the rejection or acceptance at those limits, material with
an ignition probability equal to the mean of the limits will be almost
as likely to fail as it is to pass. This again is fundamental to all
systems of assessment.
   <p>It will be seen therefore that the concepts of reliability and
discrimination as applied to testing are complex ones: overall, a
system can be made reliable to a chosen extent at the limits of a
chosen range.
<head>3. EXAMINATION OF THE NO-IGNITION TEST</head>
   <p>In the last section it was pointed out that the reliability of
rejection or acceptance is a matter of choice, and clearly opinions
will differ as to the desirable level. However, it appeared
reasonable to the present writers to require that the test should have
a 0.95 probability of rejecting an explosive having an ignition
probability at the chosen reject level. Correspondingly there should
be a 0.95 probability of accepting an explosive at the acceptance
level.
   <p>Calculations were then made which permitted the plotting of Curve
1 in Fig. 1. In this figure the true probability of ignition with a
single shot is plotted against the number of shots of the explosive
that must be fired to give a 0.95 probability of one or more
ignitions. For example a <quote>no-ignition</quote> test of 28 shots will
reject, 19 times out of 20, an explosive with an ignition probability
of 0.1 (for the rest of this paper 19 times out of 20 will be called
<quote>reliable</quote> rejection or acceptance.) Curve 2 in Fig. 1 shows the
number of shots for which the probability of one or more ignitions is
0.05, i.e. there is a probability of 0.95 of acceptance.
   <p>From these curves it will be seen that although a 28-shot
sequence will reliably reject an explosive of ignition probability of
0.1, it will not reliably accept explosives until the ignition
probability has fallen to 0.0018; in other words, if a manufacturer
submits an explosive that has a slightly lower ignition probability
than 0.1, he has a moderate chance of getting it through the test but
if he submits another that is ten times better in this respect, he has
a fair chance of having it rejected. Summarizing, if the probability
is lower than 0.0018 or higher than 0.1, the explosive will be
reliably passed or failed, but if it has an intermediate value, the
test will not give reliable results. The curves in Fig. 1 also show
that the rejection level and the number of shots in the test may be
varied over a wide range but without an appreciable change in the
value of approximately 50 for the ratio of the acceptance to the pass
level. It appears to be impossible to avoid poor discrimination with
no-ignition tests.
<head>4. TESTS PERMITTING IGNITIONS</head>
   <p>In the last section it was found that poor discrimination
appeared to be a characteristic of no-ignition tests: the effect of
permitting one ignition is shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 shows the
characteristics for 2-ignition tests. It will be noted that the gap
between the rejection and the acceptance curves narrows, i.e. the
discrimination is improved when the number of permitted ignitions is
increased.
<table>
   <p>The calculations on which Fig. 2 and 3 are based have been
extended, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The accuracy of
discrimination steadily increases with the number of ignitions (m)
accepted as the pass level. Confining attention for the time being to
a reliable rejection level of p<hi>r</hi> equal to 0.1, Table 1 shows that
the ratio (p<hi>r</hi>/p<hi>a</hi>) does not fall to the neighbourhood of 2
until the number (n) of shots fired is nearly 200 and the acceptable
number (m) of ignitions rises to 12.

   <p>The table does not extend beyond the point where (p<hi>r</hi>/p<hi>a</hi>)
falls to the neighbourhood of two because this seemed a good
compromise, as far as explosives are concerned, between the
requirements of discrimination and the need to keep the number of
shots within practicable limits; in view of the variabilities inherent
in the conditions of use, perhaps it should not be taken too seriously
if the value of (p<hi>r</hi>/p<hi>a</hi>) for a given explosive fluctuates in
the range of 2 to 1. The following example may illustrate the
operation of a test with a pass level of not more than 12 ignitions in
200 shots. This test has a reliable p<hi>r</hi> of 0.1 and a reliable
p<hi>a</hi> (acceptance level) of approx 0.05; for reliable acceptance
the manufacturers must work to an ignition probability per shot (p) of
0.05. If the product deteriorates, and is then re-tested, there is a
probability of 0.95 that the deterioration will be detected when the
ignition probability has increased by a factor of 2.0.
   <p>To a considerable extent the sensitivity of existing explosives
tests is adjustable at will, usually by adjusting the charge weight
but also by changes in the test apparatus. What are the consequences
of changing the sensitivity? Table 1 gives the appropriate figures
for rejection ignition probability of 0.5 and shows that equally good
discrimination can be obtained but with far fewer shots. Table 1
indicates that an economical and discriminating test at a rejection
level of p<hi>r</hi> = 0.5 is to fire 35 shots and permit 12 ignitions.
The calculations have since been extended by Mr. G. Fogg of
S.M.R.E. and it appears that at a rejection level of p<hi>r</hi> =
0.673 a discrimination ratio of 2 is obtained with a round (n) of 26
shots and a permitted number (m) of 13 ignitions.
<head>5. MATHEMATICAL BASIS</head>
   <p>The mathematical basis on which Figs 1, 2 and 3 and Table 1
were calculated is simple and well-known; see for example David,
F.N. (1949).
   <p>The probability, P, of an explosive being accepted after a series
of tests is a calculable function of the probability of ignition in a
single test, p, and of the standards required in the series. For
example, if our standard requirement is 0 ignitions in n trials, we
have
&formula;
   <p>For sufficiently large p, P is small and the explosive is almost
certain to fail the test. It is useful to consider the probability of
ignition which will almost certainly cause a device to be failed. To
do this, it is necessary to fix a corresponding value for P; that is,
to give a numerical expression to the phrase <quote>almost always
failed</quote>. If we define <quote>reliable rejection</quote> by requiring P &lt; 5%,
we will obtain it whenever p &gt; p<hi>r</hi> such that
&formula;
   <p>Similarly, for sufficiently small p, P approaches 1 and the
explosive is almost certain to pass. So if we define <quote>reliable
acceptance</quote> by requiring P &gt; 95%, we will obtain it whenever p &lt;
p<hi>a</hi> such that
&formula;
   <p>The range of possible p-values can thus be divided into three
parts:

   <p>Reliable rejection, P &lt; 5%, p<hi>r</hi> &lt; p &lt; 1
   <p>Results not consistent, 5% &lt; P &lt; 95%, p<hi>a</hi> &lt; p &lt; p<hi>r</hi>
   <p>Reliable acceptance, 95% &lt; P, 0 &lt; p &lt; p<hi>a</hi>

   <p>If we put these ranges side by side for different values of n, we
obtain Fig. 1, in which two curves of p<hi>r</hi> against n (Curve 1)
and of p<hi>a</hi> against n (Curve 2) divide the area into three regions:
consistent failures, results not consistent and consistent passes.

<text id=LOBJ73>
Details can be seen in the photograph, Fig. 4.
   <p>During the early part of the tests the rotors were run at 1,800
r.p.m., at which speed the radial acceleration was approximately
2,350 g, resulting in very high forces at the hub. The blades were
provided with both flapping and drag hinges, the former being freely
mounted on ball races and the latter having adjustable cork friction
dampers. The blades were found to vary slightly in weight so
provision was made for final balancing by means of small adjustable
weights on screwed rods radiating from the hubs between the blades.
These can be seen in the photograph, Fig. 4.
   <p>In order to avoid the possibility of resonance it was at first
thought advisable to run the rotors with drag hinges locked.
Eventually however fatigue cracks were noticed in the roots of two of
the blades and it was suspected that the lack of freedom in the drag
hinges was the possible cause. Later, after new blades had been
fitted, it was thought better to run with drag hinges free and so
reduce root stresses, experience having shown that the possibility of
resonance was small. As a further precaution, to eliminate fatigue
failure, the new blades of a modified design were run at a reduced top
speed of 1200 r.p.m. This question of blade fatigue is more
fully discussed in the Appendix.
<head>2.3 Equipment for measuring tracking of blades and flapping angle</head>
   <p>The front rotor carried a commutator with a single brass
segment contacting four carbon brushes mounted on a ring attached to
the front rotor spindle housing. Three of these brushes were
approximately 120&deg; apart and the fourth diametrically opposite to one
of the three. The brush contacts were used to trigger off a
stroboscope lamp illuminating the blades whilst rotating. The three
contacts at approximately 120&deg; spacings were set so that, with all
three in circuit together, they were successively out of phase by
about one chord length when the ends of the rotor blades were
observed. By this method it could be seen if the blades were tracking
correctly.
   <p>The two diametrically opposed contacts were used to facilitate
the observation of flapping angles. Each contact had a switch in
circuit and the timing adjusted so that the stroboscope flashed when a
particular blade was parallel to the longitudinal body axis either in
a fore or aft direction. The height of the blade tips in each
position was measured by means of a travelling periscope projecting
vertically downwards into the tunnel. The difference in height of the
blade tips in these two positions gave a measure of flapping angle.
The periscope was of the type used on midget submarines. The
stroboscope lamp was mounted on gimbals and the direction of the
light, shining through a thick perspex window, could be adjusted by
the observer to illuminate the particular blade tip under observation.
It was estimated that the accuracy of the measurements was of the
order of one tenth of a degree. A photograph of the head of the
periscope is shown in Fig. 6 from which can be seen one of the two
vertical slides behind which is the measuring scale.
   <p>As the periscope weighed about 60 lb it had to be
counterweighted and the wires carrying these weights, passing over
pulleys, can be seen in the photograph.
<head>3. Safety Precautions</head>
   <p>Due to the high value of centrifugal force on the rotors and
the possibility of instability, resonance, or fatigue, it was thought
expedient to protect the personnel by reinforcing the tunnel inside
with sheet steel and outside with shutters. These shutters were of
sandwich construction comprised of blocks of paper between 1/4&Prime;
thick plywood, totalling about two inches in thickness.
   <p>To minimise the possibility of stopping the rotors before the
tunnel and thereby losing the stabilising effect of centrifugal force
on the blades, an interlock was incorporated in the electrical
circuits, with a time delay of about a quarter of a minute, to ensure
that the rotors attained a reasonable speed before starting the tunnel
and also that the tunnel speed had dropped sufficiently on shutting
down. As the electrical supplies to the tunnel and rotors were
separate there remained the danger arising from a failure of the
current to the rotors but as that was thought to be very improbable,
no attempt was made to cover that eventuality.
<head>4. Method and Scope of Experiments</head>
   <p>The model was suspended from the main roof balance by two
struts spaced 22 1/2&Prime; apart. These struts carried at their ends a
spindle mounted on ball races, passing through and fixed to the
helicopter body 29 1/2&Prime; from the nose. This spindle being freely
mounted acted as a pitching axis. A further support was provided
towards the rear of the body, using a pair of V-wires attached to an
overhead split-beam balance, see Fig. 2. These wires were
adjustable by means of a windlass carried on the balance, so that the
attitude of the model could be varied.
   <p>The earlier tests were made at 1800 r.p.m. giving a tip
speed of about 400 ft&sol; sec. Later the speed was reduced to 1200
r.p.m. and a tip speed of 267 ft&sol; sec. Lift, drag, and
pitching moments were measured at wind speeds of 40, 80, 120, 160 and
180 ft&sol; sec for the tests at a rotor speed of 1800 r.p.m.
giving approximate values of tip-speed ratio, m, of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
0.4 and 0.45. When the rotor speed was reduced to 1200 r.p.m.
the wind speeds used were 25, 55, 80, 100 and 120 ft&sol; sec giving
values of m = 0.094, 0.206, 0.300, 0.374 and 0.449 respectively.
   <p>Measurements were made for blade angles, th<hi>0</hi>, of 4&deg;, 8&deg;
and 12&deg;. The angles were set by a worm and wheel at the blade roots
using a surface table and scribing blocks to measure the difference in
heights at leading and trailing edges.
   <p>Flapping angles were also measured by the method described in
para. 2.3.
   <p>Although it would have been desirable to make measurements at
very low values of m, less than 0.1, difficulty was experienced due
to the flow induced by the rotors themselves, especially at the higher
body angles. For example, without the tunnel motor running, a vane
anemometer indicated a wind speed of about 15 ft&sol; sec at
th<hi>0</hi> = 8&deg; and th = 20&deg;. As the flow was unreliable these
tests were abandoned.
   <p>Table 1 gives a summary of all the tests on the various rotor
combinations together with references to the tables giving the
results.
<head>5. Corrections</head>
   <p>The tunnel measurements were converted to the coefficients
C<hi>T</hi> and C<hi>m</hi> where C<hi>T</hi> is the coefficient of the force
normal to the longitudinal axis of the helicopter and C<hi>m</hi> is the
pitching moment coefficient about the axis shown in Fig. 3. A
further correction was made for the forces and moments on the body and
rig, etc., by making the appropriate measurements with rotors
removed and subtracting from the total. No account is therefore taken
of forces due to the interference between rotors and body.
   <p>As the final results were to be presented for constant values of
tip speed ratio, m, and the wind speeds chosen did not give exact
values and also as &formula;, where th is the
body angle, the correction varied with attitude of the model and so
all the results had first to be plotted against m and then the
values for m = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.45 taken from the curves.
Corrections had also to be made to th due to tunnel interference
and therefore the values corrected for m had then to be plotted
against th and values read off at the chosen values of th
viz., 0&deg;, 5&deg;, 10&deg;, 15&deg;, 20&deg; and 25&deg;. For convenience th
has been taken to be positive with the nose of the model downwards
which is opposite to the normal convention.
   <p>For the 9&prime; x 7&prime; wind tunnel the correction to body angle
(th) has been taken to be
&formula;
   <p>where A is the total rotor disc area C is the cross-sectional area
of the wind tunnel, C<hi>L</hi> is the overall lift coefficient based on
total disc area. The correction is such that the effective
inclination is less than the geometric inclination. It is felt that
the above correction is not entirely satisfactory as it is based on
fixed wing theory. It is hoped that at some future time a systematic
series of experiments will be made to establish the order of wind
tunnel corrections to be applied to helicopter model testing.
   <p>The corrections to pitching moment due to flapping hinge offset
are included in para. 6.
<head>6. Results</head>
<head>6.1 Effect of flapping hinge offset</head>
   <p>In addition to the corrections mentioned in para. 5 account
had also to be taken of the effect of flapping hinge offset which, due
to design difficulties, was of necessity rather large, about 6.275%.
   <p>The effect of flapping hinge offset on the characteristics of a
rotor is dealt with in a report by Meyer and Falabella and the
analysis given in that report has been used to estimate the
theoretical values of rotor thrust and flapping angles and also the
effect on overall pitching moment.
<head>6.2 Thrust coefficient</head>
   <p>Assuming uniform distribution of induced velocity and
neglecting blade tip losses the theoretical value of C<hi>T</hi> is given
by equation (38) of Ref. 3.
&formula;
   <p>As there is no cyclic pitch B<hi>1</hi> = 0 and the term involving
a<hi>1</hi> is small and may be neglected and therefore approximately
&formula;
   <p>For zero forward speed where m = 0
&formula;
   <p>Also
&formula;
   <p>In order to determine <quote>a</quote> the slope of the lift curve of the
blade section C<hi>T</hi> was required for zero wind speed. As the tunnel
was of the return flow type it was difficult to obtain a true zero
wind speed due to the flow induced by the rotors. This was cut down
to a minimum by closing the tunnel with a screen, but even so there
was a circulation of air in the neighbourhood of the model,
particularly at the larger blade angles. It was assumed that at zero
tunnel speed the induced circulation at th<hi>0</hi> = 4&deg; would be
very small and the measured value of C<hi>T</hi> = 0.00142 was inserted in
the equations (2) and (3). This gave a value of a = 5.0 (per rad)
which was subsequently used in equation (1a). A curve of static
thrust coefficient using the above value of <quote>a</quote> is given in Fig.
7. The theoretical values of C<hi>T</hi> using equation (1a) for
th<hi>0</hi> = 4&deg;, 8&deg; and 12&deg; are included in Figs. 9, 13 and 19.
It is of interest to note that the effect of flapping hinge offset on
C<hi>T</hi> is negligible, particularly at the lower values of m.
<head>6.3 Division of thrust</head>
   <p>From a knowledge of the total thrust and the pitching moment
about a defined axis the contribution of thrust due to each rotor has
been calculated. It was assumed that the thrust of each rotor acted
at the disc centre and normal to the body axis and also that the rotor
drag force, parallel to the longitudinal axis, acted at the mean
height of the two rotors.
   <p>The pitching moments as measured in the experiments included a
contribution due to the effect of the offset flapping hinges and
therefore before the thrust due to each rotor could be calculated the
pitching moments had to be corrected for offset.
   <p>In the report by Meyer and Falabella an expression is given for
pitching moment due to hinge offset (M<hi>y</hi>). This expression is
&formula;
   <p>where
&formula;
&formula;.
   <p>Values of a<hi>0</hi>, b<hi>1</hi>, and a<hi>1</hi> are obtained by solving
three simultaneous equations; these solutions are given in equations
(27), (28) and (29) in the report. As there is no cyclic pitch,
i.e., B<hi>1</hi> = 0 in the case of the model, these solutions
become
&formula;
   <p>The value of l is given by the expression
&formula;
   <p>and
&formula;
&formula;.
   <p>Using the wind tunnel values of C<hi>T</hi>, in equation (9) M<hi>y</hi>
has been calculated for various cases and it was found that the terms
involving a<hi>0</hi> and b<hi>1</hi> were quite small compared with the
a<hi>1</hi> term.

<text id=LOBJ74>
   <p>Introduction. When considering the design of a jet-flapped
aircraft from a stability and control aspect, it is necessary to have
fairly accurate information concerning the downwash field behind the
jet-flapped wing, particularly in those regions where it is
practicable to locate the tailplane. The evaluation of the downwash
at the tailplane is dependent upon a knowledge of the strength and
position of the vorticity distributions which represent the wing and
the jet. In his treatment of the flow past a wing with a jet-flap, of
infinite span, Spence assumes that the incidence of the wing and the
deflection of the jet are small, and hence the usual assumptions of
thin aerofoil theory, in which the wing and jet are replaced by vortex
sheets in the direction of the free stream, apply. The results so
obtained for the vorticity distributions on the wing and jet are used
in Part 1 to give the downwash at any position relative to the plane
vortex sheet in the form
&formula;,
   <p>where e = downwash angle, t = jet deflection angle, and a
= wing incidence. However, in the calculation of the downwash induced
at a point (P) in the field, it is necessary to allow for its
location relative to the actual wing and jet. To the order of
accuracy consistent with the previous assumptions, this implies
calculating the downwash at a point whose ordinate relative to the
plane vortex sheets is equal to the distance of the tailplane from the
jet (as shown in Figs. 1a and 1b). The functions de/dt and
de/da depend upon the jet momentum coefficient C<hi>J</hi>, and
on the relative position of the tailplane; charts for these functions,
and for the position of the jet, are given for various specific
C<hi>J</hi> values. The downwash has been evaluated for ranges of the
tailplane position, wing incidence, jet deflection and jet momentum
coefficient.
   <p>For the unswept wing of finite span, with a full-span jet-flap,
considered in Part 2, Maskell has introduced the concept of an
effective wing and jet flap of infinite span, in order to obtain the
strength of the bound vorticity, elliptic spanwise loading being
assumed. This solution may be used to give the contribution to the
downwash from the bound vorticity, in a similar way to that described
in Part 1, but it does not account for the effect of the trailing
vortices arising from the pressure gradients along the wing and jet
spans. In the case of a wing without a jet-flap, it has been found
that the downwash is very sensitive to the relative distance between
the tailplane and the wake, and that the spanwise loading has more
effect on the downwash than the chordwise loading, and so the wing and
its wake are replaced by a lifting line and its trailing vortices, the
latter being displaced in order to keep the tailplane at the correct
height above the wake. The effect of the rolling-up of the wake has
also been investigated for a wing without a jet-flap, and it is shown
that rolling-up is not important for normal tailplane positions behind
wings of large aspect ratio. The distance e behind the wing at
which rolling-up may be assumed to be complete is given by
&formula; for a wing without a jet-flap, where k&prime;
depends upon the plan-form and spanwise loading of the wing. For
the jet-flapped wing, the C<hi>L</hi> will be greater than for the
normal wing, but k&prime; may now be a function of C<hi>J</hi>, and
will probably increase with increasing C<hi>J</hi> (since the bound
vorticity on the jet will tend to resist rolling-up), so that e/c
will not decrease so quickly with increasing C<hi>L</hi> and
C<hi>J</hi>, as might have been expected from first considerations.
Thus, in order to evaluate the contribution to the downwash behind a
jet-flapped wing from the trailing vorticity, it is assumed that the
majority of the load is carried on the wing, so that the trailing
vortices may be considered to arise from one chordwise position on the
wing with no rolling-up taking place. The displacement of the jet and
trailing vortices is accounted for by taking the position of the
tailplane relative to the wake, and a chart is given for the downwash
due to the trailing vorticity. Calculated values of the downwash are
in good agreement with the few experimental results available,
especially if the difference between the experimental and theoretical
lift coefficients is taken into account. Theoretical results for the
downwash on the centre-line are also given for a wing of aspect ratio
6.0, showing variation with tailplane position, wing incidence, and
jet parameters.
<head>PART 1</head>
   <p>1. Vortex Representation of the Wing and Jet-Flap of Infinite
Span. The wing and jet-flap of infinite span may be represented in
two dimensions by vorticity distributed on the chordal plane of the
wing and the median line of the jet (assumed to be thin). The
downwash relations have been solved by Spence, using the assumptions
of thin-aerofoil theory, so that the aerofoil incidence and jet
deflection are considered to be small. The vorticity distributions
and the position of the jet are given in Fourier-series forms, with
coefficients as functions of the jet momentum coefficient C<hi>J</hi>.
   <p>Let  be the vorticity distribution on
the aerofoil (at incidence a to the mainstream) and 
the vorticity distribution on the jet (emerging at deflection t to
the extended chord-line of the aerofoil), as shown in Fig. 1a. The
x axis is taken parallel to the main stream, and the z axis
vertically downwards, with the origin at the leading edge of the
aerofoil. The chord of the aerofoil is taken to be unity, so that x
and z are non-dimensional. Thus the vortex representation of
the flow which is in accordance with the assumptions of thin aerofoil
theory is as shown in Fig. 1b, with  located
on the x axis, between 0 and 1, and  also on the x
axis, between 1 and &infin;.
   <p>Then the expressions for  and
, the jet displacement, as obtained from Ref. 1,
are: For
&formula;
&formula;.
   <p>For
&formula;
&formula;.
   <p>2. The Downwash. The downwash induced by the vortex
distributions  at the point
(X, Z) is given by
&formula;
   <p>to the first order in a and t (see Fig. 1b).
   <p>In order to apply the results calculated for the simplified
configuration (Fig. 1b) to the actual configuration (Fig. 1a),
where the jet is displaced a distance  below the x
axis, it is assumed that the downwash  calculated for
the point  in Fig. 1b is equal to the downwash at
the point  in Fig. 1a.
   <p>A similar procedure is followed in Ref. 3, where the
displacement of the wake of a finite wing has to be considered.
   <p>In general, the tailplane will be located a distance H above
the jet, as indicated in Fig. 1a, so that to evaluate the downwash
at the tailplane, i.e., at the point  in
Fig. 1a, we must evaluate the downwash at the point (X, - H) in
Fig. 1b.
   <p>The position of the tailplane is usually given as the distance
along and height above the extended chordline. If l is the
distance of the aerodynamic centre of the tailplane behind the wing
leading edge, measured along the extended wing chord-line, and h
the height above the chord-line, when the chord is of length c,
as shown in Fig. 1a, then the non-dimensional co-ordinates (X,
Z) at which the downwash is to be evaluated are given by
&formula;,
   <p>where z<hi>J</hi> may be obtained from Fig. 3 (or equation (4)).
   <p>For the numerical evaluation of the two integrals in equation
(6), it is necessary to change the variables of integration, in the
first integral using equation (1) in order to avoid the infinite value
of  at the leading and trailing edges, and in the second
integral using equation (3) to make the range of integration finite.
Thus, if we write
&formula;,
   <p>then the downwash at the tailplane is given by
&formula;,
   <p>where &formula; and &formula;
remain finite as x and th tend to zero, and as
&formula;,
&formula;. Equation (10) may be rewritten in the form
&formula;,
   <p>where de/dt and de/da are functions of C<hi>j</hi>, X
and Z. These have been evaluated for C<hi>j</hi> = 0.5, 1.0,
2.0 and 4.0, with
&formula; and
&formula;, the results being shown as charts in Figs. 4a to 4d.
   <p>Thus the procedure for the evaluation of the downwash at a given
tailplane position, h/c and l/c, and given a, C<hi>J</hi>
and t, is to calculate the functions in the following order:
   <p>(1) X from equation (8a)
   <p>(2) z<hi>J</hi> from Fig. 3
   <p>(3) Z from equation (8b)
   <p>(4) de/dt, de/da from Figs. 4a to 4d
   <p>(5) e from equation (11).
   <p>Interpolation will be necessary for C<hi>J</hi> values other than
0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0, and it seems better to evaluate e for a
range of C<hi>J</hi>, and then to interpolate the final result, rather
than to interpolate for z<hi>J</hi>, de/dt and de/da
separately.
   <p>For large X, the downwash is given by
&formula;, (see Ref. 1)
   <p>so that
&formula; and
&formula;.
   <p>It may be noted that the value of &formula;
for the downwash far behind the aerofoil is also obtained when the
aerofoil is without a jet-flap.
   <p>3. Results. The results for the downwash behind an infinite
wing and jet-flap are shown in Figs. 7 to 11. It should be
remembered that the theory is only strictly valid for small a and
t, so that the use of the method to obtain the downwash for the
larger values of a and t must wait to be justified or otherwise
until experimental data are available. However, the results should
indicate the trends in the variation of downwash with the various
parameters.
   <p>In Figs. 7 and 8, the variation of the downwash with tailplane
position is shown for two values of jet deflection angle, t, and
two values of wing incidence, a, for C<hi>J</hi> = 2.0. Fig. 7
shows that on the extended chord-line, h/c = 0, the downwash
decreases quite sharply with increasing distance behind the wing,
l/c, but when h = 2c, the downwash is practically constant in
each case for
&formula;. The results have been replotted in Fig. 8 to show
the downwash field (i.e., contours of equal downwash), in the
tailplane region. A comparison between the fields for the various
t and a shows that the downwash is more sensitive to tailplane
position for the higher t and a values, as might be expected.
   <p>The results for the variation of e with C<hi>J</hi>, t and
a are given in Figs. 9 and 10 for a representative tailplane
position, l/c = 3.5, h/c = 1.5, and also for a position on
the extended chord-line, l/c = 3.5, h/c = 0. It will be
noticed in Fig. 9a that e does not increase linearly with t
for a given C<hi>J</hi> value (as might be implied by a glance at
equation (11)) due to the correction made to the downwash field for
the displacement of the jet relative to the tailplane position.
Fig. 9b indicates that de/dC<hi>J</hi> decreases with
increasing C<hi>J</hi>. The variation of downwash with wing incidence
is more important for stability and control considerations and the
results are shown in Figs. 10a to 10d for t = 30 and 60 deg,
and for various C<hi>J</hi> values. Ranges of values of
&formula; are also indicated on the diagrams, and are seen to be
the same for the two different t values over the same range of
C<hi>J</hi> for a given value of h/c. Since
&formula; increases with C<hi>J</hi>, it is not possible to assess
a maximum, but for C<hi>J</hi> = 4.0,
&formula; is well below 1.0 at the tailplane and on the extended
chord-line, being 0.20 and 0.35 respectively. It also appears that
de/da increases as a increases, but this is only noticeable
at the higher values of C<hi>J</hi>, and for C<hi>J</hi> = 4.0, a =
20 deg, de/da is still less than 0.4 at the extended
chord-line position.

<head>Effect of Cross Draughts on the Exhaust Air Volume required for
Hot Knock-out</head>
   <p>The obstruction offered by the side of a mould does not shield
the depressed velocity zone above the mould from disturbance by the
horizontal motion of cross draughts. Consequently, cross draughts can
enhance the rate of diffusion of rising thermal currents and blow them
sideways into exhaust air streams at a point nearer to the grid, where
the exhaust air velocities are higher.
   <p>It follows that the performance of down-draught systems can be
improved by the influence of cross draughts only if the thermal
currents are blown into exhaust air streams moving at higher
velocities than the cross draughts, so that the resultant direction of
all dust-bearing air streams is towards the grid.
   <p>If the grid is unduly blocked on the down-wind side of the cross
draughts, the thermal currents will be blown into a zone of reduced
exhaust air velocities, and control of the dust-bearing air streams
can be impaired, particularly if the speed of the cross draughts is
high in relation to the exhaust air movement.
   <p>The important conclusion is that the performance of correctly
designed and operated down-draught systems for the knock-out of hot
moulds is not unduly affected by cross draughts of the order usually
present in foundries. Obviously, high velocity cross draughts, such
as may be found when the knock-out is situated near large open doors,
will seriously impair their performance.
   <p>Nevertheless, cross draughts are so variable and unreliable that
the assistance they may provide should not be considered when
designing a system.
<head>Effect of Cross Draughts on the Exhaust Air Volume required for
Cold Knock-out</head>
   <p>The effect of the cross draughts is to increase the strength of
the exhaust air velocities on the windward side of the grid and to
reduce those on the down-wind side.
   <p>Since cross draughts not only diminish the exhaust air velocities
on the down-wind side of the grid, but also blow the dust and fumes
into this zone, it follows that the exhaust air volume must be
increased by an amount that will counteract the fall in exhaust air
velocities.
   <p>The main distinction between the effects of cross draughts of
normal velocity on thermal currents and cold air streams is that the
former are deflected into exhaust air streams of unchanged or even
higher velocities, while the latter are blown into weaker air streams,
and therefore additional exhaust air volume is required.
<head>Relationship of Grid Size, Box Height and Exhaust Air Volume</head>
   <p>Examination of the results shown in Figs. 6.9 and 10 shows
that the minimum exhaust air volume does not increase in direct
proportion to the increase in the size of the grid. The proportional
increase in air volume is, however, never greater than the
corresponding increase in grid area.
   <p>When considering these results it is important to remember that
engineering methods of air flow measurement are not precise, and
errors of 10 per cent. and even more, in some cases, may occur.
Nevertheless, by considering a large number of test results, it is
possible to distinguish two marked trends in the amount of exhaust air
volume required by the 6-ft. x 4-ft. grid in relation to the
4-ft. 6-in. x 3-ft. 6-in. grid.
<head>(1) Increase in exhaust air volume.</head>
   <p>The exhaust air volume required by the 6-ft. x 4-ft. grid
with the 8-in. deep hot and cold moulds and the 16-in. deep cold
moulds tested in the absence of appreciable cross draughts exceeded
the volumes required by the 4-ft. 6-in. x 3-ft. 6-in. grid by
between 25 and 40 per cent.
<head>(2) Constant exhaust air volume.</head>
   <p>The exhaust air volume required by the 6-ft. x 4-ft. grid,
with 16-in. deep hot and cold moulds tested in cross draughts of
75-100 f.p.m. was approximately equal to (and in some cases even
less than) the volumes required by the 4-ft. 6-in. x 3-ft.
6-in. grid.
   <p>Insufficient experimental data are available to provide a
complete explanation of the conditions responsible for the similarity
of exhaust air volumes measured between the two grids with the
16-in. deep boxes in 75-100 f.p.m. cross draughts. The many
variable factors present during the tests produced complex air flow
conditions which do not facilitate comparison, but the resultant
effect of the following two factors emerges as a predominant
influence:

   <p>(a) The effect of cross draughts on the sideways entrainment
of dust-bearing air currents from the depressed velocity zone into
relatively higher exhaust air velocities near to the down-wind top
edge of the moulding box.
   <p>(b) The effect of the grid area and, therefore, grid velocity
diminishes with increasing distance from the grid until the exhaust
air velocities are almost identical, regardless of the size of the
grid, as explained earlier.

   <p>In practice, however, the number of possible variations in the
factors controlling the distance from the grid at which air velocities
become constant for a given exhaust air volume is so large that the
distance must be calculated afresh for each individual case. In
addition to the variation in the area of the vertical gaps at the
sides of the grids and in the horizontal unblocked grid area, the
pattern of grid blockage may be such that the zone above the grid is
divided into separate regions so far apart that the exhaust streams
found in them only lose their identity at a considerable height above
the top of the moulding box.
   <p>The important conclusion is that the effectiveness of
down-draught systems of knock-out ventilation will not necessarily be
improved by changes in the size and design of knock-out grids &mdash;
regardless of exhaust air volume &mdash; if the depth of the box is too
great. Field observations indicate that for the conditions described
above, 11-in. or 12-in. is about the maximum permissible depth
when knocking out hot, and that the blockage due to the box and sand
should be less than 50 per cent. of the grid area.
<head>Selection and Performance of Down-Draught Systems</head>
   <p>Importance of the down-draught system &mdash; The ease with which a
down-draught system of ventilation can be applied to a knock-out
without interfering with other foundry operations frequently commends
it to the planning engineer. The practical advantage of the absence
of ventilating equipment above floor level is that all four sides of
grids are available for the accommodation of foundry equipment, the
movement of operators, boxes and castings, and no limitations are
imposed upon the travel of cranes and hoists.
   <p>The comfort of knock-out operators is greatly affected by radiant
heat. The quantity of heat energy radiated from a surface depends
upon its area, temperature, and radiation coefficient. Since no hood
and baffles are fitted and the net area of the hot grid bars is small,
the source of heat radiated to operators is effectively limited to the
hot casting and the mould. Consequently, a down-draught system can
give not only control of dust, but also less discomfort to the
operators when dealing with a large number of very hot castings.
   <p>Limitations in the application of down-draught systems &mdash;
Down-draught systems can, as indicated by the experiments illustrated
in Figs. 6.10 and 10a, and do, as shown by Test 1 in Table 2.2,
provide effective protection from the dust and fumes produced by
relatively small castings in fairly shallow boxes. This system,
therefore, finds the greatest application in highly mechanized
foundries producing large quantities of light repetition castings.
   <p>The down-draught system has, however, certain limitations and
various factors must be considered before installing such a system.
   <p>Depth of boxes &mdash; Thermal currents cannot be reversed with
economical exhaust air if the distance between the grid and the top of
the boxes exceeds 12-in., unless special provision is made. Boxes
must always be knocked out at grid level and never turned over on
rails above the grid.
   <p>Size of grid &mdash; The larger the grid, the greater the area of
boxes that can be knocked out and, consequently, the greater the
distance between the side and centre of the boxes. The size of grids
for hot moulds should not exceed 4-ft. 6-in. x 3-ft. 6-in., or
6-ft. x 4-ft. in special cases.
   <p>Shape of grid &mdash; The ratio of the grid length to width should
be similar for both boxes and grid, so that exhaust air streams are
concentrated around the sides of the box.
   <p>Height of grid above the floor &mdash; The floor restricts the
direction from which replacement air can approach a grid and acts as
an air baffle, so that exhaust air velocities are highest when the
grid is mounted level with the floor. Raised grids should not exceed
18-in. in height.
   <p>Grid design &mdash; Green sand clogs between the bars of fixed
grids and restricts the flow of exhaust air. A knock-out point should
not be ventilated by a down-draught system unless sand is shaken
through a vibrating grid at about the same rate as it is spilt from
the box.
   <p>Blockage of the grid &mdash; The blocked section of a grid should
not greatly exceed the area of the box if the vibrating grid is
efficient. The area of the box and spilt sand together should not
exceed 50 per cent. of the grid if the exhaust air volumes given in
Figs. 6.9, 10 and 10a are to be used as the design basis.
   <p>Experiments have shown that if the blockage is increased from 50
to 75 per cent., the minimum exhaust air volumes required to control
dust and fumes are increased by amounts up to 50 per cent., or even
more in some cases.
   <p>Air seals &mdash; It is essential for knock-out units to be
provided with effective air seals.
   <p>The air seals at the sand transfer point between the hopper and
belt must remain effective regardless of the rate at which sand spills
from the hopper.
<head>Extraction of Sand and Fines</head>
   <p>In the down-draught system, air is exhausted through the sand
falling into the hopper. Should this sand, or a large proportion of
it, be completely dry, a considerable amount of the fines will be
exhausted. With very high velocities the fines may be accompanied by
fairly coarse grains. In consequence, the composition of the sand
will be radically changed. The amount of material to be collected
will be large and there may be abrasion of the ducting.
   <p>The extraction of sand and fines can be reduced by consideration
of the three following factors in design. Usually a combination of
all three is necessary:

   <p>(1) The frequency of knocking-out in relation to the size of the
hopper, rate of sand removal, and location of air ducts should be
determined, so that the sand inside the hopper can never rise unduly
close to the air inlets.
   <p>The external angle of the base of the hopper should not be less
than 60&deg;.
   <p>(2) The velocity of the exhaust air close to the falling sand
inside the hopper should be reduced by enlarged inlets.
   <p>(3) The air ducts in the hopper should be located and arranged so
that sand does not fall directly into the exhaust inlet, and the
openings should be protected by shields.

   <p>In addition, the sand-to-metal ratio and the time between pouring
and knock-out should be such that only part of the mould is completely
dry by the time the knock-out is reached (see Chapter 3). If this
condition cannot be fulfilled a down-draught system should not be
used.
<head>Sludging of Sand in the Exhaust Air Ducts</head>
   <p>Steam is released from hot moist sand moulds as they
disintegrate and fall through the grid into the hopper. Should this
steam exceed the amount which can be retained by the exhaust air, it
will condense on the exhaust ducts. Sand and dust in the air stream
will deposit on the moist surfaces or on any water at the bottom of
the duct, forming a sludge which may eventually choke the duct to such
an extent that efficient ventilation becomes impossible.
   <p>The amount of water that can be retained by the air depends on
the air volume and temperature. If the saturation level is exceeded,
the moisture condenses to form droplets which are sufficiently small
to remain in suspension as visible <quote>steam,</quote> but are readily
deposited on objects with which they come into contact.

<text id=LOBJ76>
The assumption takes account of the possibility that neither the
deflection nor the slope at the ends of the beam is zero. The
potential energy of the system is as follows:
&formula;
   <p>where b is the stiffness of the supports and K is a
constant which depends upon the datum of the potential energy.
Substituting for the D's by making use of equation (7.51) then
yields:
&formula;
   <p>and for the potential energy to be stationary:
&formula;
   <p>whence:
&formula;
   <p>being the deflection of x = 0, that is, at the load. Had an
exact solution of this problem been carried-out there would have been
seven simultaneous equations to solve in the seven unknown deflections
D<hi>1</hi>, D<hi>2</hi>,..., D<hi>7</hi>.
   <p>The loss of accuracy due to adopting an approximate procedure is
usually insignificant for purposes of engineering practice, i.e.
a few per cent. Thus the correct value of d<hi>1</hi> is 5.4 in. The
considerable saving in labour achieved is usually much more important
than a small loss of accuracy. In fact, it is possible in some
instances, that without recourse to an approximate solution by an
energy method, solution by manual activity would be too laborious to
be practicable.
<head>CHAPTER 8</head>
<head>Some Uses of the Reciprocal Theorem</head>
<head>8:1. INTRODUCTION</head>
   <p>One of the simplest statements of the reciprocal theorem which
defines the reciprocal property of linear systems, specifies that the
deflection of a point i of an elastic structure in a given
direction due to the application of unit force in a given direction at
another point j is equal to the deflection of j when unit
force is applied at i. The deflection of j is measured in the
direction of the line of action of the unit force while the unit force
is applied at i in the line in which the deflection due to its
presence at j was measured. This is manifest when the flexibility
coefficients of linear structures are calculated, since then it is
found that a<hi>ij</hi> = a<hi>ji</hi> as shown in Chapter 2. It is also
manifest when the stiffness coefficients are calculated. Further
proof of the reciprocal theorem is hardly necessary.
   <p>A simple statement of the theorem on these lines was made by J.
Clerk Maxwell in his well-known paper on the analysis of frameworks
(1864) but Clebsch had actually noted the reciprocal property of
stiffness coefficients in his book published some two years earlier.
Later Betti (1872) and Rayleigh (1873) made important general
contributions to the theorem independently, which led to its coming to
occupy an important place in the physics of linear systems. For the
purpose of structural analysis the reciprocal theorem provides useful
devices for the construction of influence lines for deflections and
forces in frameworks whose elasticity is linear.
<head>8:2. INFLUENCE LINES FOR DEFLECTION BY THE RECIPROCAL THEOREM</head>
   <p>For the purpose of illustrating this use of the reciprocal
theorem it is sufficient to consider a simply supported beam with
linear elasticity. Thus, if the influence line for the deflection of
any point P of the beam shown in Fig. 8.1 is required (that is, the
curve whose ordinates represent the deflection of P as a concentrated
unit load traverses the beam), by the reciprocal theorem it is merely
necessary to consider the deflected shape of the beam due to unit load
at P. The reason for this is that the deflection at any other point Q
of the beam due to unit load at P is:
&formula;
   <p>where a<hi>QP</hi> is the relevant flexibility coefficient. Since
this is equal to the deflection of P due to unit load at Q, i.e.:
&formula;
   <p>it follows that the deformed shape of the beam caused by unit load
at P represents the variation of a<hi>QP</hi> = a<hi>PQ</hi> over the
length of the beam which is the influence line for the deflection of
P. By similar reasoning the influence line for the deflection of any
point of an elastic linear structure, in a given direction, is
represented by the deformed shape of the structure due to unit load
applied in the specified direction at the point in question.
   <p>A convenient means of using this principle to practical advantage
is afforded by scale models. Such models need not be to scale in

every detail; for plane frameworks it is merely necessary that they
are made of material which obeys Hooke's Law of linear elasticity, to
a chosen layout scale. Then, for portal frameworks whose members
deform primarily in bending, it is sufficient for the ratios of the
second moments of area of the members to be the same as in the actual
framework. The shape of the required influence line to scale can be
obtained by applying a force to the model at the point in question, in
the specified direction. The scale factor for the ordinates of the
influence line so obtained can be found either by scaling the force
applied to the model or by calculating the deflection of the actual
framework at the point in question due to unit load applied there.
<head>8:3. INFLUENCE LINES FOR FORCES BY THE RECIPROCAL THEOREM</head>
   <p>A cantilever with a rigid prop at its <quote>free</quote> end, as one of
the simplest statically-indeterminate systems, is suitable for
demonstrating this use of the reciprocal theorem. In order to obtain
the influence line for the force exerted by the prop, suppose first of
all that unit concentrated load acts at any point Q of the span, as
shown in Fig.

8.2(a). If the prop is absent the deflection of the end of the
cantilever due to this load is:
&formula;
   <p>so that the force which the prop must exert in restoring zero
deflection at this point is:
&formula;
   <p>where the flexibility coefficients a<hi>PQ</hi> and a<hi>PP</hi>
refer to the cantilever. Therefore, by equations (8.3) and (8.4):
&formula;
   <p>Now the ratio a<hi>PQ</hi>/a<hi>PP</hi> can be obtained by
considering an arbitrary small displacement D&prime;<hi>P</hi> of
the end of the unloaded cantilever due to an arbitrary force
R&prime;<hi>P</hi>, as shown in Fig. 8.2(b), since:
&formula;
   <p>while the resulting deflection of any other point Q is:
&formula;
   <p>so that:
&formula;
   <p>Therefore, by equation (8.5):
&formula;
   <p>The significance of this result is that the deflection curve of
the cantilever due to an arbitrary small displacement of P represents
to scale the influence line for the load on the prop at P. This is in
accordance with Mu"ller-Breslau's principle that the influence line
for the force in a member or upon a support of a linear
statically-indeterminate framework is represented to scale by the
change in shape of the framework due to a small displacement within
the member or at the support. For the purpose of using the principle
for the influence line for the bending moment at any point, the small
displacement introduced there must be of the angular kind. It can be
shown by virtual work that Mu"ller-Breslau's principle also applies to
statically-determinate systems which are not subject to gross
distortion under load.
   <p>Mu"ller-Breslau's principle would be of very little practical
value without scale model techniques. The procedure prescribed by the
principle can be applied physically to a scale model for the purpose
of obtaining influence lines to scale and affords an effective method
of <quote>model analysis</quote> of frameworks. Such models must be made of
material with linear elasticity to a definite length scale. Thus, if
a model of the propped cantilever is made s times smaller than the
actual, a small displacement &formula; at P
corresponds to a small displacement &formula;
at P of the actual system.
Similarly, any other point of the model Q suffers a displacement
which may be multiplied by the scale factor s to obtain the
corresponding displacement of the point Q of the actual cantilever due
to the displacement of P of &formula;. Also
the deformed shape of the model represents the influence line for the
load on the prop of the actual system to scale. Therefore, with
reference to equations (8.8) and (8.9):
&formula;
   <p>so that:
&formula;
   <p>and the scale factor does not appear in the final result obtained
by the model in respect of influence lines for forces, because the
ratios of model displacements of the linear kind are identical to the
ratios of corresponding displacements of the actual structure.
   <p>It is relatively easy to construct suitable models of frameworks
whose members deform primarily in bending, such as portals, because
then it is merely necessary for the ratios of the second moments of
area of the various members to be correct. The actual scale factor in
respect of second moment of area is immaterial and so models can be
cut from, say, sheet celluloid, which obeys Hooke's Law. Beggs
pioneered the use of this kind of model.
<head>8:4. EXAMPLE OF MODEL ANALYSIS</head>
   <p>The steel portal framework shown in Fig. 8.3 has encastr&eacute;
stanchion feet and the second moments of area of AB, BC, and CD are I,
2I and I, respectively. In order to obtain the influence lines for
the redundants, chosen to be the reactions R<hi>1</hi>, R<hi>2</hi>
and R<hi>3</hi> at the foot A, a scale model may be used.

The model must be made of material which has linear elasticity in
accordance with Hooke's Law (e.g., it can be cut from sheet
Xylonite celluloid), to a layout scale factor s and the ratios of
the second moments of area of the model members AB, BC and CD must be
1 : 2 : 1. The required influence lines are found by subjecting the
model, mounted to reproduce the encastr&eacute; conditions at A and D, to
small displacements horizontally (for the influence line for
R<hi>1</hi>), vertically (for R<hi>2</hi>) and rotationally (for
R<hi>3</hi>) at A, in turn, and recording the resulting changes in
shape of the model. It is important for each displacement to be
applied at A separately without movement in any other direction.
   <p>Suppose the influence lines so obtained are as shown in Fig.
8.4 and that it is desired to determine the magnitudes of the
reactions at A caused by the loading shown in Fig. 8.3. Then using
subscripts m to denote that the displacements are obtained from
the model:
&formula;
   <p>which are independent of the scale of the model. For R<hi>3</hi>,
however, the scale of the model enters into the calculations and for
this reason it is desirable to refer the model displacements to the
corresponding values for the actual structure. Thus, if the foot A of
the actual framework were rotated through th radians the resulting
deflections

would be s times those of the model when its foot A is rotated
through the same angle. Using the equivalent full-scale influence
line ordinates then to obtain R<hi>3</hi> gives:
&formula;
   <p>since th is
&formula;.
   <p>Again, for a uniformly distributed loading of intensity w
over, say, CD, the corresponding values of the reactions at A are:
&formula;
   <p>where distance x along CD refers to the model, so that if
a<hi>1</hi>, a<hi>2</hi> and a<hi>3</hi> are the areas enclosed by the
relevant portions of the influence lines of the model, respectively:
&formula;
   <p>and for practical purposes it is sufficiently accurate to assume
that the influence lines are straight between measured ordinates.

   <p>The influence line for the bending moment at a point within a
member can be obtained similarly by cutting the model at the point in
question and applying an angular displacement, as indicated in Fig.
8.5. The required bending moment due to particular loading is then
obtained from the influence line ordinates in a manner similar to that
used for finding R<hi>3</hi>.
   <p>It is particularly important to measure the influence line
ordinates correctly, as, for example, in Fig. 8.4 with respect to
the line of F<hi>Q2</hi>. Accuracy can also be improved by using
positive and negative displacements, as shown in Figs. 10.20 and
10.21.
   <p>Use of scale models for the analysis of frameworks is always
worth considering as an alternative to manual computation, especially
for frameworks of simple form whose members are of non-uniform section
for reasons of economy. Accuracy of model analysis tends to lie
between 5% and 10% in relation to values calculated exactly on the
basis of the same assumptions as those used in constructing the model.

Two articles have appeared by Bichsel on electron microscopy; one
is concerned with an investigation of sub-grain structure in high
purity aluminium, while the other is general, describing the
application of oxide replica techniques and the examination of thin
foils. The illustrations in all these papers are impressive
scientifically and attractive aesthetically; it is only a matter of
time before they receive the attention of designers of wallpaper,
floor coverings and similar goods.
   <p>Single crystals continue to attract the experimenter; McKinnon
has studied the work-hardening of a super-purity aluminium crystal,
and indicated that during stage 1, that is the period of slip on
(111) plane of maximum resolved shear stress, the rate of hardening is
determined by the amount and type of uniformly distributed secondary
slip. Greetham and Honeycombe have deformed single crystals of
aluminium-4.5% copper given various ageing treatments after solution
treatment. Under-aged crystals showed a marked yield point followed
by a period of low hardening, while over-aged crystals and those
treated at the optimum temperature, though showing no yield point,
strain-hardened rapidly. By X-ray and metallographic study, Richards
and Pugh have determined the sequences of behaviour of super-purity
aluminium during rolling and annealing. Structures after various
amounts of cold reduction are illustrated as photomicrographs and
X-ray transmission patterns.
   <p>Blade, Clare and Lamb have used levitation melting to provide
ingots of zone-refined aluminium containing additions of various
elements, which were then rolled to sheet for determination of
recrystallisation temperatures. As little as 0.001 at. % of the
addition elements was sufficient to produce most of the retardation of
recrystallisation; silicon, copper and magnesium each caused an
increase of recrystallisation temperature of 50-100&deg; C., while for
iron, chromium and manganese a figure of c. 200&deg; C. is
quoted. At temperatures varying from 195-500&deg; C., Ormerod and
Tegart have subjected super-purity aluminium to torsion stresses, and
determined torque values which are converted to shear stress, while
specimen revolutions are converted to shear strain, the two being used
to draw true stress&sol; strain curves. Davies has performed
stress-rupture tests on the aluminium-1% nickel alloy favoured for
resistance to corrosion by high temperature water, and obtained 1,000
hour values of 0.75 at 350&deg; C., 1.8 at 250&deg; C., and 4.2 at 100&deg;
C., the units being kg&sol; sq. mm.; English eyes would have
preferred tons&sol; sq. in.
<head>Corrosion and Protection</head>
   <p>No form of degeneration of metals is more insidious than
corrosion, and the volume of work published on the subject is a
measure of the seriousness with which it is viewed. Evans has
produced a monumental volume of great authority on the corrosion and
oxidation of metals in general, with an author index containing no
less than 3,000 names. A fat volume, but the scribbling has been very
well worth while, and as with Gibbon's work it will well outlive the
author. Another useful book is that written by Rogers, principally
for the education of naval constructors who are responsible for the
maintenance of ships of war; aluminium receives its due meed of
attention, with alarming illustrations of what happens when wrong
procedures are adopted, and details of correct design and practice.
   <p>The power of the corrosive enemy must be recognised and assessed;
Great Britain has the unenviable reputation of being a particularly
aggressive place. Ambler has found that the distribution of chloride
in the British atmosphere has the same general relation to distance
from the sea as in West Africa, and that the corrosion of steel and
zinc bears no relation to salinity; encouragingly, he considers that
the corrosion of his aluminium specimens was so small as to give high
errors on cleaning. A new hazard has been added to corrosion testing.
At Llanrhystyd, Ambler's specimens were liable to be licked by cows
on the landward side; he states that this would not be expected to
give low results, but this surely depends on the corrosivity of cow
saliva as against the beneficial effects of regular cleaning.
   <p>In continuing its work on the basic causes and mechanism of
corrosion, the National Bureau of Standards in the U.S.A. has
established that with large single crystals of high purity aluminium
exposed to an acid mixture, configuration of etch pits differed
according to crystallographic orientation, and the rates of attack
varied radically from those observed in an alkali mixture. Edeleanu
has studied the pitting mechanism, using 99.999% aluminium foil in
sodium chloride solution, and demonstrated that the rate of attack per
unit of active area inside a pit is a constant, and that changes in an
external polarising current change the rate of pitting only by
altering the active area. An electron micrograph of a pitting system
illustrates effectively the frequent changes in direction of the
attack. In a general summary of the causes of pitting and its
effects, Robinson makes the cardinal point that to avoid it one must
eliminate the chloride ion or inhibit it; it is not always possible to
adopt either of these admirable actions, so that pitting must
sometimes be lived with and allowed for in design and selection of
materials.
   <p>Susceptibility to intercrystalline corrosion may be a less
serious matter than proneness to stress-corrosion; indeed, in the high
strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys, stress-corrosion failure can occur when
very little evidence of corrosive attack is to be detected. In
developing tests for the susceptibility of this type of alloy to
intercrystalline attack, Ketcham and Taylor do not mention
stress-corrosion, and while their tests are no doubt of value, tests
including stress application would be preferred. Silver is highly
cathodic to aluminium, and alloys containing large additions of silver
might be expected to be correspondingly low in corrosion resistance.
This has been shown to be the case by Stadelmeier and Whitener; in
their aluminium-silver alloy, Ag<hi>2</hi>Al was precipitated on the
grain boundaries, and in a refrigerator atmosphere samples were
completely pulverised in four weeks. A Committee of the National
Association of Corrosion Engineers has reported on its investigations
of techniques applicable to the examination of aluminium corrosion
products, including X-ray diffraction and fluorescence, thermal
analysis, electrographic methods, spectrographic analysis, microscopic
examination and quantitative and qualitative tests.
   <p>Having purified water sufficiently for it to merit the
application high-purity, the user is anxious to keep it so, and
Knoedler and Gordon have assembled test data on many materials that
may be used for containers, pipes, etc., including steel sprayed
with aluminium, and the same combination coated with a polyvinyl top
coat. Commercially pure aluminium and aluminium-manganese alloy tanks
were also used, and the water showed 0.035 parts per million of
aluminium after 56 days' storage; a very low proportion. In comparing
metals for compatibility with 90% hydrogen peroxide, Bloom and his
co-workers award classification 1 only to pure aluminium, certain
aluminium alloys and zirconium. A rocket fuel rejoicing in the name
of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine has been successfully stored in
aluminium containers for three years without ill effect, as reported
by Raleigh and Derr. Many somewhat unusual chemicals are needed in
conjunction with rocket engines, and Geiger, Schuler and Mowers have
discussed material selection problems in the light of present
knowledge. Aluminium is compatible with hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen
tetroxide, liquid fluorine and inhibited red fuming nitric acid,
amongst other rocket chemicals.
   <p>Aylmore, Gregg and Jepson have studied the oxides formed when
aluminium is heated in dry oxygen and interpreted their results as
showing crystallisation of an initially formed amorphous layer. Using
an A.C. bridge, Lorking measured the capacity and thus the
thickness of non-porous oxide films on aluminium; chloride ions in
solution increased the permeability of the film, and this was detected
by potential measurements. Since a general air of pessimism permeates
the account by Capp and Philibert about ship corrosion, their remarks
about trouble with aluminium are perhaps less unacceptable; however,
they seem to be ill-informed about developments since the war in such
matters as riveting and boundary bar joints, and the general avoidance
of bimetallic corrosion. The stupid things that are still done are
exemplified in an account by Brooks of a floodlight from a fishing
vessel, that had castings in an aluminium alloy containing 2 1/2%
copper, was bolted together with brass bolts, and employed an
absorbent fibre gasket. It seems hardly conceivable, but these things
still happen, even in the second half of the twentieth century. In
the aircraft industry, hazards are much more fully recognised; Heath
has shown how modern aircraft design is being modified to provide
access to all parts for inspection, to ensure that unobserved
corrosion cannot proceed to cause a catastrophe. This requirement in
design is, of course, most important in modern aircraft from which
long service lives are expected.
   <p>Corrosion at welds has not proved a serious problem with
aluminium since the dangers of flux entrapment were eliminated by the
adoption of inert gas-shielded welding methods; however, trouble with
large gas-welded cooking pans in aluminium-2% magnesium alloy
described by Latimer was not due to flux residues. <quote>Knife-edge</quote>
attack along the sides of the welds was shown to be associated with
the coarse structure of the partially fused zone, and the presence of
continuous b-phase on the grain boundaries of the heat-affected
zones. This could be avoided by welding at a faster rate with less
heat input, e.g. by tungsten-arc welding. Oldfield and Twigg
investigating the staining of stainless steel tableware, tested blades
in contact with galvanised iron and with aluminium in Sheffield tap
water at 60&deg; and 100&deg; C. They concluded that aluminium containers
are reasonably safe for trays or baskets for washing stainless steel
cutlery, but galvanised iron can cause staining.
Aluminium-magnesium-silicon alloy (similar to H9-P) pipe, TIG
welded, and used for sour gas was inspected by Flournoy after being
buried for six years without protection in a soil of sandy loam and
broken caliche. Where failure had occurred, it was by pitting from
the outside, and chlorides were detected in the corrosion product.
This experience shows that aluminium is resistant to sour gas, and
may be installed bare underground if protection is afforded at local
spots of high corrosivity.
   <p>If one keeps the anti-freeze in the cooling system of one's car
from year to year, one runs the risk of corrosion of the cast-iron
parts of the circuit, due to increase in acid content and reduction of
inhibitor content of the cooling liquid. This has been shown by
Collins and Higgins, who also state that the danger of corrosion of
other metals by the deteriorated anti-freeze is slight; only
occasionally has slight pitting been seen with aluminium, and no
corrosion necessitating replacement has resulted. Investigating the
special case of hypereutectic aluminium-silicon alloys under
conditions related to car engine cooling systems, Craig and Woods have
shown that such alloys, even when coupled to copper, are corroded to a
negligible extent if there are suitable inhibitors in the coolant; in
general, hypereutectic aluminium-silicon alloys are more corrosion
resistant than cast iron.
   <p>Sundararajan and Char, continuing their studies of inhibition of
the corrosion of aluminium, have assessed the effects of acridine,
nicotinic acid, dextrin, thiourea and tannic acid in dilute
hydrochloric acid; all were efficient. In a second paper these
authors describe polarisation studies in acid and alkaline solutions,
with thiourea and dextrin as inhibitors, and conclude that cathodic
protection is possible in acid solutions in the potential range -0.55
to -0.80 V. In both these papers one meets again the curious
material previously described by Sundararajan and Char, namely 92%
pure aluminium, containing 3% Fe, 4% Mn, 1% Si; doubts about
decimal points return more strongly than ever. Using some impressive
mathematics, Bauer and Eddy have compared various possible anode
materials for the protection of water tanks. One interesting factor
affecting choice is whether or not the water freezes and breaks the
anode or suspension; if it does, aluminium is used, because of its
cheapness.
   <p>Chemical conversion coatings have been summarised by Ayres,
considering them principally from the point of view of corrosion
resistance, which is conferred by low chemical activity and
solubility. Wells and Pinner have surveyed recent advances in
chemical and electrolytic polishing, on all relevant metals including
aluminium.

This particular detecting element illustrates why the plant
engineer is slow to take up new ideas, for at first sight to introduce
microwave generating and detecting equipment into a power station
fills the plant engineer with horror. It is only when the equipment
can be made rugged and utterly reliable that he will consider using it
at all.
   <p>Nowadays engineers tend to use detecting elements which give an
electrical output. The reason for this is that it is a matter of
extreme simplicity to amplify the signal to any degree which is
necessary. Moreover, it is very easy to transmit the signal from one
part of the plant to another without serious loss. Detectors having
an electrical output are therefore of growing importance at the
present time, although in many cases a mechanical output is still
quite satisfactory.
<head>Pneumatic Devices</head>
   <p>It is surprising that so little use is made of pneumatic
devices for measurement and control of small distances. Work which
has been done in the British Scientific Instrument Research
Association has shown that pneumatic gauging is an almost ideal way of
deciding if a sliver of a semiconducting material is of the right
dimensions for manufacturing a transistor. Pneumatic bearings also
have a considerable application which has not been developed outside
gyroscopes: for example, a patent has recently been taken out covering
the use of a pneumatic bearing for a glass polishing head. Passing on
to optical detecting elements, which are now beginning to receive the
attention they deserve as a result of the application of electronic
devices to replace the human eye, these are coming more and more into
favour as on line instruments. The nondispersive infra-red
spectrometer is a good example, while the automatic saccharimeter
developed at the National Physical Laboratory has a good future, but
it is when one comes to consider the more sophisticated optical
electronic instruments that one finds the numerous advantages of
utilising the visible and near visible portions of the electromagnetic
spectrometer. The Hilger &amp; Watts automatic spectrographs are now well
known and are in constant use in the iron and steel industries, while
optical methods are beginning to be used in the guidance systems of
many of our guided missiles. The importance of electrical detecting
elements has already been stressed. Of these, the piezo electric
effect is the best known and most used, apart from the obvious
conventional cases of the thermocouple and the resistance thermometer.
The piezo electric effect can be used to launch ultrasonic waves in a
liquid or in a slurry, and the resulting phenomena are only now being
investigated on an industrial basis. Nucleonic instruments tend to be
largely electronic devices. The detecting element itself generally
uses a nucleonic phenomenon, but the remainder of the apparatus is
electronic. The reason for this is that nucleonic detection usually
takes place in a very short space of time and, of course, the big
advantage of electronics is its speed of response.
   <p>The preceding paragraph gives some general reflections on
detecting elements. A book could easily be written on this subject
without exhausting the possibilities.
   <p>Mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic and electrical amplifiers are
all in use in automatic control systems, and these represent the
second class of component into which the system can be resolved.
Mechanical amplifiers are exemplified by levers, while hydraulic
amplifiers are exemplified by transference of a pressure or a flow
from a wide tube to a narrow one. Pneumatic amplifiers operate in
much the same way as hydraulic amplifiers, but offer greater diversity
in their application. It should be noted that in none of these cases
is there any real gain in the energy of the signal. For example, a
lever increases the movement which is available to the observer, but
it does so at the expense of the effort which is available at the end
of the lever. The same is true of the hydraulic and pneumatic
amplifiers which have been mentioned. Nevertheless, amplifiers have
been made which correspond exactly to the electronic amplifier: the
signal strength is actually increased at the expense of a reservoir of
gas or liquid. Electronic amplifiers are essentially devices which
transform part of the direct current available from the power supply
to signal current, which can then be used to perform an operation.
   <p>The third element of a control system is the transmission itself.
At the present time the transmission is very often done hydraulically
or pneumatically, but electrical systems are gradually coming into
use, subject, of course, to the stringent conditions of intrinsic
safety. Where long runs are required, electrical transmission is
obviously to be preferred.
<head>The Use of Computers</head>
   <p>The next item in the control system has gained considerable
notoriety and is sometimes thought by the uninitiated to be the
principal component. It is the data logger or computer. Computers
were originally manufactured in analogue form to solve certain complex
differential equations and, in the first instance, they were
mechanically operated. Thereafter, electronic computers came in,
operated digitally, and since then there has been competition between
the analogue computer and the digital computer. To a certain limited
extent the analogue computers are very useful for the examination of
plant characteristics, and such computers can be used to advantage
when a new plant is being set up which is to be automatically
controlled throughout. On the other hand, where extreme accuracy is
required the digital computer is the only one to use and electronic
digital computers are employed to advantage in performing difficult
calculations in optics, in stresses and strains in aircraft, and in a
multitude of other problems. So far as process control is concerned,
after the preliminary investigation has been carried out by means of
an analogue computer, the equipment to be used on the plant should be
as simple as possible and should comprise a detecting element, a data
logger and a controller, the third being connected, of course, by
transmission lines. The data logger is usually called upon to perform
one or two simple operations and, as such, it is not worth while using
a general purpose electronic digital computer to do the job. It is
therefore the writer's opinion that general purpose computers have no
long term significance so far as process or machine tool control is
concerned. Rather the data loggers and computers which will be used
in these circumstances will be small black boxes, designed to do
specific jobs. It will be seen that the problem of the computer is in
no way related to the problem of the detecting element. When we are
concerned with the right kind of detecting element to use for a
particular purpose, this takes us into the background of science to
examine all the various phenomena and decide on the right device. On
the other hand, so far as data loggers and computers are concerned it
is a matter of straightforward engineering, for the circuits and
devices to be used to perform the various specific tasks are all well
understood. There is only one case where this may not be completely
true, and that is where extreme speed is required in the computer, but
this occurs so seldom in process control or machine tool control that
it is hardly worth considering.
<head>The Controller</head>
   <p>The last element in the automatic control system is the
controller itself. This has to be a mechanical device since it is
applied to the line and changes certain parameters therein.
Controllers nowadays are usually described as <quote>three term</quote>,
meaning that they have a proportional control, a control which is
determined by the rate of change of the signal, and a control which is
determined by the integral of the signal. Three term controllers
require careful setting up, and to make the best use of them an
exhaustive analysis of the plant is necessary, but there is no doubt
that three term control is essential in most cases if the plant is to
operate at optimum efficiency.
   <p>The necessity for the three term controller is to be found in the
mode of variation of any particular parameter. For example, if we are
concerned with temperature measurement and the temperature should
suddenly shoot up, then some degree of anticipation is given to the
controller by means of the rate of change of the signal. On the other
hand should the parameter vary slightly between fairly wide limits
over a long period of time, then it is very difficult to maintain it
at the desired value unless an integral of the signal is used in the
control system. No doubt more complex controllers could be
manufactured and may be used in the future, but in the meantime the
rate of change, the signal itself, and the integral of the signal give
sufficient control.
<head>The Instrumentation of Reactors and Conventional Electrical Power
Units</head>
   <p>Whether coal or uranium is used as the fuel, the power unit
must always contain certain basic automatic controls. At the present
moment the output of any station is in the form of electricity, which
usually comes from a turbogenerator. Certain conventional
instrumental controls are necessary at this end, but with the
increasing use of reactors as power producing units, a completely new
set of problems has been posed to the industrial instrument
manufacturer. Apart from the measurement of such novel parameters as
the neutron flux in the reactor, the control of temperature has become
of major importance. An elegant solution to this problem is not yet
in sight, but reactors are able to operate using a very large number
of detecting elements which measure temperature. One of the
outstanding problems of reactor instrumentation is the measurement of
flux of intermediate energy neutrons. The British Scientific
Instrument Research Association began an investigation of this problem
some three years ago and the results so far achieved are promising.
As might have been expected, on the way towards the solution of the
set problem (the measurement of flux of intermediate energy neutrons)
many other problems have been brought to the notice of the Association
and have been solved. It is probable that the work at present in
progress on new types of phosphors will result in a new set of
instruments becoming available to the reactor engineer. If this is
so, the economics of reactor manufacture and operation will need to be
completely revised.
<head>Power Units in Industry</head>
   <p>Almost every big factory in the country produces a large amount
of steam, which is then used for many purposes. These power units are
all very similar and one would expect that their instrumentation would
be well known and well defined. This is not the case, however. Apart
from the measurement and control of fuel, steam pressure, water, and
alkalinity or acidity, there are many other factors which must be
measured in an economic power plant. The air to fuel ratio, the
carbon monoxide content in the flue gases, and the smoke issuing from
the chimney must all be controlled, and almost every factory has its
individual system. There is certainly room here for a large amount of
standardisation and, among smaller firms, for education in the value
of adequate instrumentation.
<head>Future Trends</head>
   <p>It is a difficult matter at this juncture to specify the future
trends of instrumentation among our basic industries, and so it may be
well to deal, first of all, with those matters which are well defined.
There is no doubt that large chemical plants could use to advantage
on line instruments to perform simple chemical analyses, but in many
cases progress is at a standstill because it is very difficult to
imagine a detecting element which can be successfully applied to a
plant. Another trend which has been mentioned above is towards the
small special purpose computer. The general purpose machine usually
contains much more than is necessary to perform its operation on the
plant, and it is only by cutting out these unnecessary devices that
the computer can be made an economic proposition. This trend is
fairly certain. The other trend which appears to be well established
is towards the detecting element having an electrical output.

The ultimate concentration in the liquid oxygen will, therefore,
depend on the equilibrium constant for the impurity when present in
low concentration in liquid oxygen. Also, if the solubility is low,
precipitation may occur before the concentration in the exit gas
reaches the required value, and accumulation of the impurity as a
solid will occur.
   <p>Table 3 shows the results of calculations for a number of trace
impurities in which, for different assumed concentrations in the inlet
air, the concentration in the liquid oxygen in the evaporator for
steady state operation has been determined for gaseous oxygen
production.
   <p>It must be appreciated that the figures for the concentration
build up are dependent on the accuracy of the equilibrium data, which
are uncertain, but the table does give an indication of the order of
magnitude to be expected. It is important to note that where high
concentrations are theoretically possible in the plant evaporator the
time required to build them up may be considerable, thus easily
allowing steps to be taken to prevent such accumulations occurring.
   <p>Before discussing the methods which are adopted in practice to
achieve this, we shall consider in a little more detail the effect of
impurities in the air intake.
<head>Effect of trace impurities in the air feed</head>
   <p>There has been a considerable amount of work carried out in
recent years on the effect of trace impurities in the air feed. Not
all of it has been convincing, and certain aspects are still by no
means clear. It is impossible to do more than briefly review
available information and data here.
   <p>In considering the relative significance of trace impurities,
particularly hydrocarbons, it should be borne in mind that small
concentrations of hydrocarbons dissolved in liquid oxygen do not
necessarily present a hazard. This depends on the susceptibility to
detonation of the hydrocarbon solution, and on the explosive limits.
Data are incomplete for such solutions, but generally if the
percentage by weight of the hydrocarbon in homogeneous solution is
less than 2%, detonation cannot be initiated. In practice, it is
obviously undesirable to operate near such a limit.
<head>LIGHT HYDROCARBONS, CARBON MONOXIDE, AND HYDROGEN</head>
   <p>In general, the C<hi>1</hi> and C<hi>2</hi> hydrocarbons such as
methane, ethane, and ethylene, (but excluding acetylene) which have
relatively low boiling points, do not normally present any hazard if
present as traces in the air intake to a plant since they are
appreciably soluble in liquid oxygen, and their equilibrium constants
in admixture with this are relatively high. This means that they will
not tend to accumulate in, for example, the oxygen evaporator to any
dangerous concentration under likely operating conditions.
   <p>Carbon monoxide and hydrogen in trace quantities present no
hazard since hydrogen is incondensible at the temperatures involved
and is removed with the atmospheric inert gases, helium and neon, at a
suitable vent-point in the plant. Carbon monoxide is similar to
nitrogen in properties and is, in fact, more volatile than oxygen. It
therefore presents no hazard in trace concentrations.
<head>HIGHER HYDROCARBONS AND ACETYLENICS</head>
   <p>Hydrocarbon impurities under the rather arbitrary
classification of higher hydrocarbons and acetylenics can arise from
three possible sources.
   <p>The first is physical carry-over of hydrocarbon oil from, for
example, an oil-lubricated expansion engine. This can accumulate as a
solid in an oxygen evaporator unless provision is made in the plant
design to prevent such an occurrence.
   <p>The second source is from atmospheric contamination.
   <p>The third is oxidation or thermal cracking of compressor
lubricating oils where a reciprocating compressor is used. By the use
of relatively low interstage pressure ratios (3/1 or less) and by the
use of lubricating oils of high stability, contamination from this
source can be reduced to very small proportions. The problem does not
arise with turbocompressors.
   <p>The higher hydrocarbons and acetylenics have low vapour pressures
at liquid oxygen temperature and are, therefore relatively
non-volatile. When combined with a low solubility, as in the case of
acetylene, accumulation as a precipitated solid can occur. It is for
this reason that acetylene is one of the most dangerous of hydrocarbon
contaminants. Its solubility in liquid oxygen at its normal boiling
point is approximately 6 parts per million and its K-value
(defined as the ratio of the mol-fraction of hydrocarbon in the gas
phase to the mol-fraction in the liquid phase under equilibrium
conditions) is between 1/15 and 1/70, depending on the data used, for
oxygen evaporator conditions. Whilst solid acetylene itself is more
stable than usually realised, when mixed with liquid oxygen it is
detonated relatively easily. It has also been shown that when a solid
acetylene&sol; liquid oxygen mixture contains fine inert solid particles,
then the susceptibility of the mixture to detonation as measured by an
impact sensitivity test is high.
   <p>It has also been stated by Karwat that an incrustation of solid
acetylene on oxygen evaporator tubes, which can be wetted by splashing
with liquid, represents a particularly dangerous condition.
   <p>It should be appreciated that whilst the amount of acetylene
which can accumulate in a plant may not always in itself be sufficient
to cause a serious explosion, it can, however, act as a trigger or
detonator for the explosion of larger amounts of carbonaceous material
if these should be allowed to accumulate.
   <p>It is interesting to note that recently it has been pointed out
by Karwat that propane may, under certain conditions, present a rather
greater hazard than has perhaps hitherto been recognised, mainly due
to the fact that although its solubility in liquid oxygen is
relatively high (circa 50 000 parts per million of oxygen) its
equilibrium constant is very low. Even traces in the air feed can,
therefore, accumulate in the oxygen evaporator unless removed.
   <p>The higher molecular weight hydrocarbons do not normally cause
appreciable difficulty because they are almost completely non-volatile
at low temperatures and are removed in the purification or heat
exchanger system.
<head>NON-HYDROCARBON IMPURITIES</head>
   <p>The main non-hydrocarbon impurities which are likely to pass
through the heat exchanger system and initial purification on air
separation plants are nitrous oxide, ozone, and oxides of nitrogen, in
particular, nitric oxide. These impurities will also tend to
concentrate in the oxygen evaporator, in particular nitrous oxide
because of its low equilibrium constant. It has a low solubility
(circa 100 v.p.m.) and there have been suggestions that
mixed crystals of nitrous oxide and acetylene may form from saturated
solutions arising in air separation plants which can be easily
detonated when the acetylene content of the mixed crystals is high
enough.
   <p>Whilst fully conclusive evidence is not available, there are
indications that the presence of ozone or oxides of nitrogen, (or
both) in the presence of acetylene or other hydrocarbons may increase
the susceptibility to explosion. Further information is required to
elucidate fully the possible role of these contaminants.
<head>SOLID PARTICLES</head>
   <p>A factor that is not always mentioned when discussing the
safety of air separation plants is the importance of strict
cleanliness during plant assembly to avoid the introduction anywhere
into the low temperature system of possible carbonaceous material,
i.e. carbonaceous dust, cloth fibres etc., since they
can constitute a hazard if they accumulate in sufficient quantity at a
particular point where a high oxygen concentration exists.
<head>Safety measures</head>
   <p>We shall now briefly review the various methods which have been
or are used to control impurity build up in air separation plants. It
is important to stress that the degree of protection which is employed
may frequently be influenced by the amount of contamination of the
atmosphere in the vicinity of the plant.
<head>PURIFICATION OF THE AIR ENTERING THE PLANT</head>
   <p>An obvious method, if practicable, is to eliminate impurities
in the air entering the air separation unit. One approach to this
problem is the use of catalytic purifiers after the air compressor in
which the heat of compression is used, partly at least, to raise the
air to a temperature at which the hydrocarbon impurities present can
be catalytically oxidised. For example, in an installation in America
a Hopcalite catalyst has been used. Whilst for heavily contaminated
atmospheres this initial purification may have advantages, it is
relatively costly and also will not completely remove all trace
impurities which will, therefore, nevertheless require treatment and
removal at a later stage. A further disadvantage is that if used with
a reciprocating compressor, oil contamination of the catalyst and loss
of activity can occur if it is used directly after one of the
compression stages.
   <p>A different method of reducing the contamination in the air
intake, particularly in industrialised areas, is the use of
alternative suction lines, sometimes of considerable length, leading
outside the contaminated area. These may be changed over depending on
wind direction and the intensity of local contamination. This again
does not eliminate contamination but it can reduce it appreciably.
<head>REMOVAL OF IMPURITIES IN THE HEAT EXCHANGER SYSTEM</head>
   <p>The removal of the less volatile trace constituents in the
air-feed can take place in the heat exchanger system to some extent
depending on their concentration, physical properties, the type of
heat exchanger system, and the air pressure. For example, in a plant
using regenerators in which the air is cooled at approximately 5
atm abs almost to its dew point (approximately -173&deg; C),
acetylene may be condensed in the regenerator packing and resublimed
in the nitrogen of the next cooling cycle if the concentration in the
inlet air exceeds approximately 0.6 v.p.m. This is a valuable
safeguard of such plants. In plants operating with higher pressures,
e.g. fluid-producing plants, the effect of the superimposed
air pressure in raising the vapour pressure of condensible impurities
reduces, or may eliminate the possible deposition of impurities in the
heat exchanger system.
<head>REMOVAL AT LOW TEMPERATURES</head>
   <p>One of the simplest methods of reducing the build-up of
contaminants in the oxygen evaporator, which is the crucial part of
the plant, is to provide a continuous purge of liquid. This has been
practised since early days, but by itself is not an entirely
satisfactory operation since it is only palliative, can easily be
misapplied, or not operated, and also imposes an additional
refrigeration load due to liquid withdrawn and rejected.
   <p>The next step was to use an additional small condenser built away
from the main plant condenser which was operated in series as far as
the oxygen flow was concerned. The basic elements are shown in Fig.
4. A small purge was led away from the additional condenser and
rejected. The net result is a relatively large purge from the main
plant condenser, and an appreciable accumulation of impurities in the
additional condenser. This, however, is small and suitably protected,
so that if, in fact, an explosion should occur, relatively little
damage is done. Whilst the above arrangement together with correct
condenser design has been largely used in the past, the tendency today
is undoubtedly towards the use of adsorption of the impurities from
one or more of the process streams. Silica gel is the adsorbent
commonly used.
   <p>There are a number of places at which one can apply such a
clean-up system and they will be briefly mentioned. Fig. 5 shows a
hypothetical and simplified plant flow diagram in which the various
positions in which such adsorbers can be used is indicated. For
illustration, the plant cycle shown is a low pressure plant using
regenerators and producing gaseous oxygen.
   <p>Adsorption from the gas phase at or near the saturation
temperature has attractions and silica gel adsorbers placed after the
regenerators on low pressure plants provide a very effective clean up.
The adsorbers are, however, large and relatively costly.
   <p>The effect when a number of impurities are present on their
individual adsorptive capacities under dynamic conditions, must be
allowed for, i.e. the occurrence of sorption displacement has
to be considered. For example, Karwat showed that in solution in
liquid oxygen trace impurities reached their <quote>break point</quote> in a
silica gel adsorber in the order of ethane&sol; propane&sol; nitrous oxide +
ethylene&sol; carbon dioxide&sol; propylene and acetylene, whereas in gas
phase adsorbers the order of break through was ethane&sol; ethylene and
nitrous oxide&sol; propane, and then acetylene and propylene.

Another generalization presented in Chapter 6 was the application
of the technique to large structural assemblies in which we provide
also for the so-called interaction or external redundancies. As far
as the practical side of the cut-out technique is concerned this was
discussed in connexion with windows, doors, wing-fuselage
interpenetrations, floors, partial removals of rings, etc. Now, we
may consider the cut-out process as a special case of the more general
modification technique and this was, in fact, usually our approach to
the presentation of the relevant theory. However, we did also mention
that there is an essential difference between the cut-out and
modification techniques in their practical application. This is
immediately evident if we have to apply these respective procedures to
a large number of elements which may be taken to form a sub-system.
Thus, when the flexibilities of the elements of the sub-system have
to be modified it is obvious that we have to include all stresses
specified in the elements to be altered in the matrix b<hi>1h</hi>
and other relevant matrices of the sub-systems. But this is not so
if we wish to eliminate the sub-system. Here we may achieve its
effective removal by detaching it along its boundary in the parent
regularized structure, leaving only a statically determinate
connexion. Hence, in this approach, we actually cut only the
redundant members of this connexion without having, at the same time,
to break it up internally if it is itself redundant. On the other
hand, it is perfectly legitimate to carry out, in addition, these
internal eliminations, but this extends inevitably the amount of work
involved and the order of magnitude of the matrix to be inverted. But
on no account can we cut beyond this stage for we would then create a
kinematic mechanism which means mathematically linearly dependent rows
in b<hi>1h</hi> and a consequent singularity of the process.
Thus, we see that in the case of the elimination of sub-systems there
is no unique number of cut-outs and, furthermore, no unique position
of these cut-outs. We may achieve a minimum of eliminations by
removing only the redundancies along the boundary and we may reach a
maximum of eliminations by cutting also the internal redundancies.
These subtle considerations are dealt with in great detail in Section
36 and illustrated on a wide range of examples showing the alternative
ways we can view and solve these problems. Prior to this we summarize
for the convenience of the reader in Section 35 the basic theory of
the modification and cut-out procedures as developed in a number of
sections of this book and take this opportunity to generalize slightly
the presentation. We hope that this joint account of theory and
solutions to specimen problems will contribute to a deepening of the
understanding of the cut-out technique and of its applications to
practical cases.
   <p>The concluding section of this chapter generalizes the matrix
programme for the bending moments in the rings put forward in Section
12. The reader will remember that the method given there ignored any
discontinuity of the bending moments at the vertices. Now, this may
be a too rough approximation when large loads (e.g. at wing
fuselage attachments) are applied at the external vertices or other
points of the rings. The necessary simple theory is developed in
Section 37.
<head>33. Techniques to Improve the Conditioning of the D Matrix</head>
   <p>First a word of apology to our mathematically more
knowledgeable readers. We are only too conscious that, in our
repeated references to the conditioning of the D matrix, we have
been guilty of imprecise language, not having really defined
mathematically what we mean by the conditioning of a set of linear
equations in the unknown redundancies. Indeed, our whole approach to
this matter was rather of applying the terminologies well- or
ill-conditioned as qualitative terms of praise or abuse to a system of
equations. Now, ill-conditioning can, in fact, be expressed by
various mathematical measures. Unfortunately, most of these precise
measures involve as long computations as the solution itself of the
simultaneous equations and are not, hence, very useful in practice for
giving advance warning. We refer the interested reader to the papers
of Todd, Turing, and Johannes \von Neumann cum Goldstine. Even
the relatively simple rule that ill conditioning is present when the
value of the determinant
&formula; is small (more precisely we should state that
&formula; is small compared with the individual terms of expansion
of
&formula; in the co-factors of the elements of any chosen row or
column) is not of much value in computational work. Nevertheless, in
structural problems it is usually possible to adopt a simple measure
sufficient for practical purposes. To fix ideas, consider a fuselage
with two bays where only one set of primary redundancies Y arises
at the intermediate frame station. Having introduced &mdash; for reasons
connected exclusively with the application of the digital computer &mdash;
the inversion technique of Eqs. (4, 21, 44) for the direct
determination of the complete b<hi>1l</hi>, b<hi>1q</hi>
matrices, and hence also of b<hi>1r</hi>, we are necessarily
faced with self-equilibrating systems which are spread over the
complete cross-section or, at least, over the main (outer) periphery.
To express then with a high degree of accuracy (from the practical
computational point of view, which is the only one which interests us)
any arbitrary self-equilibrating stress system in terms of the
b<hi>1l</hi>, b<hi>1q</hi>, b<hi>1r</hi> distributions, it is
mandatory that the columns of these matrices &mdash; each of which
corresponds to a redundancy &mdash; be not even remotely linearly dependent.
This is evidently achieved when the flange loads, field forces and
ring bending moments due to Y exhibit an increasing waviness with
increasing order of redundancy. The search for such distributions
brought us, more or less inevitably, to the selection of the
trigonometrical matrix O<hi>l</hi> as a transformation matrix
A<hi>l</hi> defining the redundancies. As we know from Chapter 4
and a large number of other similar computations, it appears that for
the cross-sections commonly occurring in practice the flange loads and
field forces based on O<hi>l</hi> do indeed retain the full
waviness of O<hi>l</hi>, although naturally they are not any
longer orthogonal as in the uniform circular cylinder. If the rings
or frames were now rigid this characteristic waviness would ensure the
precise determination of the redundancies and we then say that the
associated equations are well conditioned. For the associated matrix
D<hi>yy</hi> &mdash; which in the present case where D<hi>yyr</hi> is
zero reduces to
&formula;
   <p>we observe that the diagonal terms d<hi>ii</hi> must be strongly
preponderant, the non-diagonal d<hi>ij</hi> being the smaller the
better the waviness of O<hi>l</hi> is retained. It is now
possible to give the conditioning some measure by the degree of
satisfaction of the condition
&formula;
   <p>which is the generalization of the simple requirement usually
quoted for 2 x 2 matrices. From the strictly mathematical point of
view the inequality (2) ought to be defined more rigorously to express
a sufficient condition theoretically acceptable; at the same time we
know that it is not a necessary prerequisite for good conditioning.
Nevertheless, for us engineers the relation (2) yields for structural
matrices a sufficient measure for satisfactory conditioning.
   <p>We must interpolate here in our main argument and refer briefly
to the method of establishing systems of redundancies previously
advocated by us in Ref. (30). Contrary to what we put forward in
the present treatise, we suggested there that it is advantageous to
select systems of a distinctly local character. Clearly then
condition (2) still holds and is the better satisfied the less
overlapping there is between the self-equilibrating systems. For
reasons set out in the introduction and subsequently, we preferred
here the method of direct inversion for the determination of
b<hi>1</hi>.
   <p>Considering next the more realistic case of fuselages with rings
of finite stiffness, we find that the matrix D<hi>yyr</hi> becomes
of paramount importance (this being at least so for the lower order
redundancies) and Eq. (1) must be written as
&formula;
   <p>We noted in Chapter 5 that the internal ring forces
b<hi>1r</hi> are much more prone to lose their full waviness when
the cross-section departs significantly from the circular shape. It
is inevitable, in such instances, that the off-diagonal terms
d<hi>ijr</hi> (elements of the matrix D<hi>r</hi>) may become of
similar order to d<hi>iir</hi> and/or d<hi>jjr</hi> so that the
measure of conditioning, Eq. (2), will consequently deteriorate and
yield, in extreme cases of severe loss of waviness, a positive value
only slightly above zero (of course, it can never become negative in
structural problems). Such unfavourable conditions may prevail only
in a few isolated spots of the D<hi>yy</hi> matrix and we observed
in Chapter 5, p. 195, that they do not seem, in our experience, to
affect appreciably the accuracy of the solution, as long as these
<squote>\Scho"nheitsfehler</squote> are within
&formula;
   <p>On the other hand, as these unfavourable patches spread, the
solution of the equations in the redundancies becomes increasingly
inaccurate due to the limited number of digits available and the rapid
accumulation of errors. Naturally, all methods of inversion or direct
solution of equations are not equally sensitive to this danger in each
specific case. Although such pronounced ill-conditioning should not
often occur in practice, it remains a distinct even if remote
possibility. We are thinking here of double cell cross-sections with
doubly-connected rings of unfavourable shape &mdash; for which the
conditioning of the symmetrical higher modes deteriorates rapidly &mdash;
and the rather box-like cross-sections of fuselages specially designed
for bulky loads.
   <p>Our unavoidably superficial account leaves many extremely
difficult questions unanswered; in particular, the precise or
statistical correlation between order and spread of bad patches, on
the one hand, and loss of the accuracy of the solution on the other
must unfortunately be ignored. An interesting practical point
concerns the acceptable degree of inaccuracy in a solution due to such
or other causes of errors. The practising engineer may often, and
rightly so, consider a solution as satisfactory, although to us
primarily interested in this instance to develop new methods, it may
appear unacceptable. We referred to this issue in the introduction to
this chapter when we discussed the application of the four-flange
systems as redundancies. Now, for the reasons stated there and here,
we must reject such a narrow utilitarian outlook and seek, in fact, a
system of redundancies even better than that based on O<hi>l</hi>,
if the conditioning of the latter should prove to us unsatisfactory.
However, quite apart from the purely technical reasons, which demand
such an extension of our original method, it is also perfectionism &mdash; a
close companion of any intense research activity &mdash; which induces us to
search for a more appropriate transformation matrix A<hi>l</hi>.
Before we proceed to the examination of this question, we must
first conclude the bird's eye view of our theme.
   <p>The discussion of the previous paragraphs was concerned with the
so-called conditioning of the matrix D in the case of a single set
of the primary redundancies Y<hi>a</hi>. When the fuselage extends
over more than two bays, there arises at each intermediate frame
station i a set of redundancies Y<hi>i</hi>. It is evident that
our previous account is still applicable to the submatrices
D<hi>ii</hi> in the leading diagonal of D<hi>yy</hi>. We denote
the conditioning of these matrices as peripheral to differentiate from
another type presently to be mentioned. Now, when a satisfactory
conditioning of the leading diagonal submatrices has been achieved
this will also apply, in general, to each of the other submatrices (in
the secondary diagonals) of the five-band supermatrix D<hi>yy</hi>.
Only a very violent change of cross-section could, in
extremis, give rise to a significant ill-conditioning in these
submatrices. However, from the point of view of the overall
conditioning of the complete D<hi>yy</hi> matrix, another possible
source of ill-conditioning has to be looked for. Thus, if the
off-diagonal submatrices, say, D<hi>i,i+1</hi> (or
D<hi>i,i+2</hi>) arising from the coupling of the sets Y<hi>i</hi>
and Y<hi>i+1</hi> (or Y<hi>i+2</hi>) were proportional to
D<hi>ii</hi>, the proportionality factor being only slightly smaller
than unity, then it is evident from what we said previously in the
peripheral kind of conditioning, that a new kind of ill-conditioning,
conveniently denoted as a longitudinal one, could originate.

<squote>Are you sure you're quite fit? It's terrible weather.</squote> He
turned round to face his colleague.
   <p>For some esoteric reason Fairbanks always completed the buttoning
of his flies in the main area of the lavatory. <squote>Good morning,
Harold,</squote> he said. <squote>I'm pretty chipper, thanks, considering.</squote> He
was a tiny man, of fanatical neatness, his remaining hair snowy, and
cropped like a Prussian's. His white shirt cuffs were actually
starched: he protruded from them his surprisingly thick and hairy
wrists and began to wash. <squote>As a matter of fact a good hard frost
seems to clear the old tubes. Much better for me than the rain.</squote>
   <p><squote>Good,</squote> said Colmore. <squote>Excellent.</squote>
   <p>Fairbanks hummed a few bars in a voice made resonant by the very
weakness of his chest. Colmore was ready to leave, but delayed his
departure, as one who dare not go to bed early for fear of missing
some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing
interest. He took up a clothes brush.
   <p><squote>I'd like a little conference this morning,</squote> said Fairbanks.
<squote>Ten-thirty be all right?</squote> He did not wait for a reply. <squote>Get
J.D., will you?</squote>
   <p>J.D. was Davis, the other Assistant Secretary.
<squote>Conference</squote> was Fairbanks's word for finding out what was going
on. <squote>Yes, Charles, certainly,</squote> Colmore said. It was not the
Secretary's return to health that was disconcerting this morning &mdash; the
man had to retire at sixty &mdash; but his irreproachable fa&ccedil;ade.
Westminster and Lincoln &mdash; not, of course, absolutely full-fruit
standard, but serviceable enough. Colmore had more than once read his
entry in Who's Who: son of Canon Fairbanks, married to the
daughter of a knight, member of the Devonshire. Colmore thought of
his own parents, now safely dead: his mother's wen, his father's lack
of aspirates. With such a background one could never be really safe
however brilliant one was. There were a score of things that could
betray one's weakness, things that lay totally outside Fairbanks's
conception. Perhaps some outrageous relation would suddenly decide to
call on him at his office: his Uncle Howard, say, whose nose had
doubtless grown no less purple over the years. Or his accent, which
had carefully acquired a neutrality as unidentifiable as some
composite creature evolved by statisticians, could break down
unbeknown to himself, on the pronunciation of a common and tell-tale
word. Or, more subtly, his whole habit of mind and body, formed in
the uncultured, nagging, parsimonious, penurious household of his
childhood, might, at a crucial moment of his life, reveal him as
utterly unsuitable for further advancement &mdash; not necessarily or,
indeed, at all, by a word or gesture or family connection, but through
the image of himself that had willy-nilly and over an extended period
been fixed in the eyes of those who controlled his destiny.
   <p>Fairbanks reached for a towel, a clean one and not the scarcely
crumpled one that Colmore himself had used and had left thriftily on
the ledge below the mirror rather than consign to the linen basket.
Of course, Colmore thought, as he put down the clothes brush and left
the lavatory, in one sense, in a very real sense, his own action,
which would have saved the two or three coppers on the Authority's
laundry bill, would have been the right, the virtuous one. He had
simply never properly learnt what came to Fairbanks quite naturally,
that the rules of conduct which must be enforced on the inferior mass
do not apply to the rulers themselves. It was not long ago that
Fairbanks had personally overhauled the system whereby the departments
of the Authority indented for stationery stores, making the ordering
the responsibility of a department's Senior Administration Officer
who, among many other things, was henceforth to issue new pencils only
on the surrender of an equivalent number of pencil stubs.
   <p>When in 1940 he had first entered the service of the Authority &mdash;
though in those remote days it had, of course, been merely the
Executive Committee &mdash; he had imagined that even its higher reaches
were, like his own level, simply a matter of work, of problems set and
overcome, of the advancement of the able and the stagnation of the
inefficient. But as he had progressed and the organization itself had
grown, he had begun to encounter all the unforeseen forces of birth,
influence and intrigue. He had occasionally &mdash; even in those days &mdash;
glimpsed the highest powers and their way of life: the building (and
this was 1941) of a massive series of oak lockers for the Committee's
hats and coats, following the theft of the Vice-Chairman's umbrella; a
meeting of the Committee itself with virgin blotting paper,
freshly-sharpened pencils, cut-glass carafes of water, and its members
displaying not their ability (which no doubt in some cases actually
existed) but the quality of their garments or knowledge of each
other's background, and even in the case of the ex-Trade Union members
a salience, a richness of feature that seemed at once designed for the
convenience of the newspaper cartoonist and the product, like the
splendour of a jungle animal, of some special advantage of nurture or
habitat, so that each moustache or bald head or pair of spectacles was
a unique and peculiarly finished specimen of its kind, possessing,
indeed, some curious aesthetic quality as though added by a great
painter.
   <p>As he moved up in the hierarchy &mdash; or, rather, was buoyed along by
the great influx of personnel below him when the Authority became the
Authority and began to expand at an increasing rate with the end of
the war &mdash; the world of the rulers grew less strange: it occasionally
recognized his existence, his promotions became its concern, and he at
last saw the possibility of breaking into it. Though that was not
quite the phrase, for even if he could succeed Sir Charles he would,
as an executive, be eternally differentiated from the Governors.
Fairbanks managed the Governors beautifully, he knew more than they,
he was cleverer than most, discreetly used their Christian names &mdash; but
remained their servant. They had no office hours, however elastic;
their lives were spent in committee making decisions for others to
execute on the basis of data laboriously gathered for them; they moved
from board-room to board-room, encountering a succession of new
pencils, clean towels, institutional crystal and silver, protein-rich
lunches, immaculate agendas, able slaves. Lord Groves, for example,
though doubtless compelled by earlier habits of comparative poverty to
fried fish high teas, existed for the greater part of his life in
luxury, lolling in the back of an Authority Austin or in a
complimentary stall, strolling along the promenade at a Conference,
eating in a free pullman car on his way to open a new Authority
provincial office. And even Lord Groves, despite his proletarian
origins and political complexion, shared the fierce, jealous morality
of the rulers. If Colmore was apprehensive of Fairbanks's view of his
conduct, how much more had he to fear from the Governors, who at the
breath of a scandal would close their ranks and utterly disown him.
   <p>In their company he had sometimes had to check an expression of
opinion, divining &mdash; as a child, ignorant of the moral standards of the
adult world, anticipates censure in the premonitory motion of a mouth
or eye &mdash; that what he was about to say would offend the collective
ethos. It would be utter folly, for example, for him to indicate that
he lacked religious belief; though, no doubt, several of the Governors
had never for years set foot in a place of worship, together they
presented a solidly spiritual front. Colmore remembered, too, how one
of their number had once commented to him on what to the speaker was
the Royal Family's excessive interest in horse racing; but the
institution of royalty could never be called into question, and from
the critic himself would certainly come one of the loudest of the
murmurs of ~<squote>God bless her</squote> after a proposal of the loyal toast.
For on this level, the great monoliths of the state which to the
population at large presented the simple issue of aye or no, were
capable of intimate criticism, albeit they were of unquestioned
acceptance &mdash; as the friends of a celebrated actress will, without in
the least denying her greatness or surpassing beauty, remark on a mole
or wrinkle which the general public has never been close enough to
see. Among the Governors there was often casual talk of <squote>Royals</squote>
or <squote>Buck House</squote>: in the last analysis it was the honours and titles
bestowed by the state through the institution of royalty &mdash; like the
ease of mind which came through the allegiance to an official
religion &mdash; which these men most valued, for in their position they
were ambitious less for money than for the infinite gradations of
social and public distinction.
   <p>How stupid and gross would seem to them Colmore's abortive
romance! Indeed, so it seemed at this moment to him. His desires,
his fumbling way of fulfilling them, put him at the same sort of
disadvantage as his voice, his school, his family &mdash; perhaps the one
stemmed in some way from the other. As he reached his room he was
seized with a sudden fright about Davis, who had come into the
Authority the normal way, via the Civil Service, and whose lack of the
ultimate ability lay hidden in a charming orthodoxy.
   <p>It was not until Colmore had been at his desk for a half-hour
that his sense of power and control returned. His mastery of the
Authority's vital processes made him look forward with almost painful
pleasure to the meeting with Fairbanks and Davis, as a well-prepared
candidate to his examination. So that as he made his way to
Fairbanks's room &mdash; fileless, paperless, leaving on his desk the daily
returns of the Authority's financial position, having transferred the
relevant figures effortlessly to his memory &mdash; he searched greedily in
his mind for some other reason for being happy, and lit on Judith. He
marched up to the next floor, looking down at the sharp crease of his
trousers along his thighs, sensing the satisfactory hang of his
unbuttoned jacket as it moved gently in the disturbed air made by his
passage, and thought: I'll keep her in reserve. The thought was
comic even to him &mdash; that he should treat her like an item in the
Authority's accounts. But how few men of his years had this unobvious
relationship, this inexhaustible source of aesthetic enjoyment, this
secret and unforeseen extension of their youth, and who of those few
would voluntarily surrender to the passionless final phase of their
lives.

   <p>The telephone rang and Colmore rose immediately. Dorothy said:
<squote>Let Anna take it, darling. She ought to practise her English.</squote>
Anna was their European girl of the moment, half maid, half student.
   <p><squote>No,</squote> Colmore said, <squote>she's been waiting long enough for lunch
as it is. And one of us will have to go in the end.</squote> They had just
sat down at table after a rather extended session of gin and frenches
with Colmore's three companions of the morning's golf whom he had
brought home to meet up with their wives, already being entertained by
Dorothy. A comforting husk of inebriation separated Colmore from
reality and it seemed to him that his reaction in anticipating that
the call would be from Judith was phenomenally quick and sagacious.
They had not been in touch with each other since the unsatisfactory
evening that had begun with the intrusion of the callow young man from
Gilson &amp; Freeman's, whose name he could not dredge up through the
alcohol, and the thought of speaking to her and even, in this
uninhibited moment, arranging to see her soon &mdash; tomorrow, tonight &mdash;
brought an excitement to him that was almost physically erotic. In
the few yards from the dining-room he had time not only to review all
this in detail but to savour the remains of his last mouthful of
p&acirc;t&eacute; and to admire once again the colour and pattern of
his new tweed suit that he was wearing for the first time today.

<text id=LOBK02>
   <p><squote>Then perhaps I should &mdash; shall we say &mdash; qualify my name,
sir,</squote> he suggested. <squote>We are known &mdash; the family, I mean &mdash; as the
Stratford-Lees. My mother likes it. She was a Stratford, you
see, from Norfolk.</squote> He spoke as though both of us should be
acquainted with the Stratfords of Norfolk, but neither one of us
commented. <squote>But the Old Man doesn't care for using double-barrelled
names, as he calls them. And I think I agree with him. That's why I
use just the plain <quote>Lee</quote> on my cards. But if you think</squote> &mdash; and
his expression changed quickly to deliberation &mdash; <squote>that I should use
the Stratford-Lee, just out here I mean, then of course &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh Lord, no,</squote> I said, perhaps just a little too abruptly.
<squote>There are far too many double-barrelled names out here as it is.</squote>
   <p>He sat back again, obviously satisfied. <squote>I'm inclined to agree
with you, sir,</squote> he said.
   <p>We had a leisurely lunch. Nigel's cook-boy had prepared an
excellent curry, hot enough with chili to make my eyes water a
little, even after so many years of hot curries. The gin \pahits,
and now the beer with the curry, had their desired effect on us; or
rather, on Nigel and myself. Lee, I noticed, had asked for Coca-Cola.
This rather surprised me from a young man who was otherwise so
sophisticated. He was not, however, ostentatious about the matter.
If anything, he had merely become a little more reserved, and much
more polite. I thought to myself: <squote>A few years in the East, my boy,
and you'll drink &mdash; I've seen your kind before!</squote>
   <p>After the curry, I wanted only to go upstairs to bed. I had long
since become accustomed, and now addicted, to an after-curry nap.
Lee, however, showed not the slightest sign of fatigue.
   <p><squote>I wonder if you'd mind if I took a bit of a look round,</squote> he
asked Nigel. <squote>I don't sleep in the afternoons.</squote>
   <p>Nigel, I must say, was very good about it. I knew how much he
probably wanted to sleep himself. But, almost gallantly, he said:
   <p><squote>Not at all. I'll show you.</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh no,</squote> young Lee protested, considerate as always. <squote>That's
not necessary if you want to rest, sir. I'm sure I won't do any
harm.</squote>
   <p>Nigel laughed. I had not known he was so good-natured. But
then, I suppose I had never given him similar cause to display such
amiability.
   <p><squote>I hadn't for one moment thought you would,</squote> Nigel said.
<squote>Bring your swimming costume, if you like. We've got a small pool
over on the other side of the estate, near the latex factory.</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh excellent!</squote> young Lee said, and his face lit up with
enthusiasm, like an energetic young athlete.
   <p>I only just recall hearing them drive off from the bungalow as I
took myself gratefully up the stairs and, stripping off to just
underpants in the heat of the afternoon, collapsed on the bed. As I
went off to sleep, I was very grateful to Nigel for not having
suggested that I should accompany them.
   <p>I slept soundly, and much later than I should. It was already
after six when I awoke, and the sun was nearly setting beyond the west
window. Downstairs I could hear the murmur of voices, and knew they
were back. I wondered, as I wrapped a sarong around my waist,
if Nigel at all resented being deprived of his afternoon sleep.
   <p>They were sitting over the tea things when I joined them. Nigel
didn't look at all put out; in fact I decided he must have quite
enjoyed himself with young Lee during the afternoon, and I was glad of
it. No, Nigel wasn't put out; but to my surprise, and amusement,
I detected a slight frown of disapproval from Lee at my sarong,
and my feet shod in only \s&ecirc;patus. And I said to myself:
Oh, God, doesn't the boy ever relax! He turned his gaze away from me
almost instantly, but it had been enough to make me conscious of the
nakedness of the upper half of my body, even of the matted grey hairs
on my chest. He probably thought my appearance quite a breach of the
social graces; but, naturally, he said not so much as a word about it.
   <p><squote>We've just had tea,</squote> Nigel said. <squote>Would you like the cookie
to make you a fresh lot?</squote>
   <p><squote>I'd rather have whisky,</squote> I told him.
   <p><squote>Thought as much. Sun's nearly below the yard-arm, anyway.
Wouldn't mind a \stengah myself. How about you, Harry?</squote>
   <p>So they had managed to come to the stage of using each other's
Christian names, I noted. Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as reserved as I
thought.
   <p><squote>Thanks, Nigel,</squote> he said. <squote>Just Coca-Cola. Although I'd
like to have whatever you have. I want to get to know the kind of
life people lead in the East, you know.</squote>
   <p>At this, I felt a return of the irritation I felt with him at
times. He would not have had a drink for the sake of the drink, but
only to know the kind of life we led in the East! But then I
dispelled my irritation, or endeavoured to; apart from its being so
irrational, I had, probably, another two or three weeks of his company
ahead of me. It would be silly, at this point, to let such
trivialities bother me. I was even surprised that they should.
   <p>The drinks were served, not by the Chinese cook-boy, but by two
young Malay girls dressed gracefully in sarong and \k&ecirc;baya.
Barefooted, they moved around the room silently, but with
voluptuous and unmistakable insinuation. I could tell almost
instantly which one I preferred. As she set down my drink beside me,
I looked at her, probably with blatant assessment, and she returned my
gaze with a mischievous sidelong glance, and just the faintest
suggestion, though quite inaudible, of a giggle. Knowing Nigel, I
would have been surprised if he had not made his usual
<squote>arrangements</squote>. A bachelor himself, he knew well how to entertain
his bachelor friends.
   <p>He caught my look and pursed his lips in a quick little grimace
of acknowledgement; then raised an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's
direction. I shrugged a shoulder. Lee would have to decide about
that for himself, I thought, and noticed that although he was looking
at the other girl, he did so quite dispassionately, almost as though
he was merely interested in the unfamiliar clothes she was wearing.
And I thought to myself: He may be still too much of a <squote>new chum</squote>
to see <squote>the beauty of the East</squote>.
   <p>There was still an ease in our conversation, but its scope was
restricted. I felt that I could hardly make the usual enquiries and
comments about Nigel's various mistresses as I was accustomed to
whenever I saw him, much as I wondered which of his girls was in
favour at the moment. And I suppose he felt the same. We had only a
few drinks, then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early dinner.
Lee was impressed not only with the estate, or so he said, but also
with the accommodation provided for a planter, and a bachelor at that.
It was, of course, very comfortable, and Nigel had made it very
presentable with additions of furniture, pictures, the radio
equipment, and personal touches of his own. He read widely, and had
collected a sizeable library. He was also interested in Malay
customs, more especially in those of the aboriginal Sakais, and his
walls were adorned with a varied collection of Sakai weapons. He had
one of the better Kashmir carpets on the floor. His pictures and
curtains, indeed I suppose the entire furnishings, had been selected
personally. The house was, as he occasionally proclaimed, his
home &mdash; and he had made it as such. I doubt if he will ever leave
Malaya, even when he retires. The country, and his mistresses, have
come to mean too much to him. And, indirectly, this impression I had
of him was one of several reasons why I had decided I should leave
it &mdash; before, for me too, it would be too late.
   <p>I used the excuse of our early start in the morning to retire as
soon as it seemed prudent to do so, after the coffee and brandy,
already anticipating the familiar pleasures awaiting me. Lee did not
demur, and I gathered from Nigel's expression that he had presumed
that his other guest, even if of so recent acquaintance, would approve
of, and even appreciate, his usual <squote>arrangements</squote>. After I had
showered, I found that the girl I had looked at was in the bedroom,
making a pretence of tidying my clothes. I got under the mosquito-net
and lay there in my sarong, waiting for her. Patiently,
precisely, she folded the last garment and put it on the chest of
drawers. Then she turned out the light and, without saying a word,
took off her \k&ecirc;baya and, unwinding her sarong, moved it
up from her waist to over her breasts in the sleeping position. There
was just enough light seeping through the windows for me to watch her.
Then she came to the bed, and I lifted the mosquito-net for her as,
still without a word, but with another barely audible giggle, she lay
beside me. Without further ado she began the assiduous and almost
energetic routine of love-play. For such a leisurely race in almost
everything else &mdash; not only leisurely, but renownedly lazy &mdash; the
Malays, surprisingly enough, have a sort of energetic deliberation for
their dancing and love-play, but which is not to be mistaken for
ardour.
   <p><squote>\Chantek,</squote> I murmured obligingly, not really meaning it,
nor really caring whether she was beautiful or not, but only glad
to know that she kissed in the Western fashion and not just as Moslems
do. I kept her mouth busy so that I would not have to go through the
usual long and boring rigmarole of being told what her name was, who
her parents were, where she was born, where she had lived &mdash; and
especially the list of names, displayed like a string of beads, of all
the white \tuans she had slept with. But, as I succumbed to the
lewdness of her skilled ministrations, I could not help wondering
about young Lee's reactions to <squote>the arrangements</squote>. He in turn was
probably wondering, I supposed, if this was the kind of hospitality he
could expect in every bachelor's bungalow in which he might find
himself as a guest. But, even in Malaya, not all of them are Nigels.
   <p>My companion of the night was gone when I awoke in the morning.
Nigel has them well trained, I thought to myself. I dressed quickly,
curious to see how Lee had reacted to it. I expected, or even hoped,
that it would <squote>unbend</squote> him a little.
   <p>I was surprised to find that he was not only dressed, but packed
ready to continue the journey. He was pacing up and down the
living-room with obvious irritation. Nigel was not yet down, and Lee
looked decidedly relieved when he saw me; wished me an almost
grateful, but still polite, good morning.
   <p><squote>Did you sleep well?</squote> I enquired, deliberately turning away
from him a little to look through one of the windows.
   <p><squote>I kicked her out!</squote> he said perfunctorily.
   <p>The tone of his voice quite astonished me. Turning, I saw, with
surprise, and again with amusement, that he was standing rigidly in
the centre of the room, his arms held stiffly to his sides, almost
like a child playing soldiers and standing to attention. His eyes
penetrated mine with a fierce fixity, and his cheeks were inflamed
with two small spots of bright red.
   <p><squote>I think it was damned presumptuous, I must say!</squote> he
declaimed hotly. And then, perhaps because he had become conscious of
the slightly ridiculous pose he had struck, and this consciousness
humiliated him, he slumped slightly, spreading his legs apart, almost
like the child soldier standing at ease; or, rather, standing easy.

<text id=LOBK03>
   <p>Yet, he might be wrong. A hope began to rise in his viscera.
Perhaps he was mistaken. Perhaps the entry in Sylvia's diary &mdash; she
hated her mother; she had been jealous of his attentions to her;
perhaps it was the hysterical invention of a child who herself in
puberty had fallen in love with the nearest, familiar man. Perhaps
that was the origin of her hatred which had then led him by her
subconscious design to the diaries. The memory of Elizabeth, greeting
him with her outflung arms, soared into his mind and with it the
recollection of the bloodstained towel which he had held to her
forehead.
   <p><squote>Oh, God,</squote> he thought, <squote>perhaps I'm wrong,</squote> and with the
thought came an unexpected hope like that of a man who, told that he
has an incurable disease, hears that the pathologist had made a
mistake in examining the tissue. Perhaps I'm wrong. The hope became
a music, and with it a compulsive need to see Elizabeth again, to hold
her and to feel again their old safe love.
   <p>
   <p><squote>That ends our proceedings,</squote> said the Chairman, and the
Members rose with a shuffle and scraping of chairs. They began to
leave the Committee Room like a pattern of the trends in the Party.
Ormston stepped down from the dais into the central aisle, taking the
longest route through the room to the Public Exit. He was greeted on
all sides with friendly smiles. Members made a path for him, and he
was quickly surrounded by a number of ex-Ministers who had retired to
the back benches, a few knights of his recommendation, and a
rank-and-file of younger Members whom he had encouraged with advice
and expectations.
   <p>Gore and a few of his associates in the New Africa Group became
involved in this stream as it pressed towards the door like a
debouching cinema audience, and they were regarded with the same
indifference as members of cinema audiences reserve for each other.
   <p>Melville moved towards the platform exit, together with some of
the Party officials and Waters. He was followed by about half the
Members in the room as if he were leading them into a plebiscite.
They grouped themselves around him, smiling and demonstrative as if
to show where their sympathies and loyalties lay, though no one
addressed him personally. In the Corridor, the Chief Whip caught up
with him, and said,
   <p><squote>I thought the Chancellor settled Gore pretty well.</squote>
   <p><squote>Did you?</squote> Melville said. <squote>I had a different impression; I
rather thought he was goading him.</squote>
   <p><squote>To abstain?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes,</squote> said Melville. <squote>There's nothing he likes more than to
frighten the Party. That's the first step. Then he likes to come
along and kiss it better.</squote>
   <p>He outdistanced his attendants with Waters, and said,
   <p><squote>I'll have to talk to the P.M.. Will you telephone and
arrange for me to go down to Greystoke tomorrow?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes,</squote> said Waters. <squote>Are you lunching in the Members'
Dining-Room?</squote>
   <p><squote>No,</squote> said the Minister. <squote>I want to walk across the Park.</squote>
   <p>
   <p>He walked briskly without hat and coat, and soon felt himself
sweating under the hazy, copper-coloured sky, heavy with the storm
which had begun to rumble and crack beyond Buckingham Palace. The
ducks had retreated to the reeds, and the water had black reflections.
On the grass, couples lay stretched out, the men in shirt-sleeves,
the women in sleeveless summer dresses, some engaged in what otherwise
would have seemed coital preliminaries, were such activities not the
normal convention of London crowds in hot summers. Others picknicked
 close by &mdash; the whole a picture of domestic living in the
open air.
   <p>As Melville walked, a thunderclap awoke the prostrate figures as
if by the alarm signal of a gigantic clock. They rose. The women
smoothed the creases of their dresses. The men languidly put on their
jackets. And to the accompaniment of the first fat raindrops, they
began to move swiftly away in pairs. The lake started to become
dappled with rain, there was a dazzling flash, followed by a massive
roll, and soon the Park began to scurry with figures running for
shelter from the storm.
   <p>As Melville walked, he heard steps splashing behind him.
   <p><squote>Like a share of my mac?</squote> a voice said.
   <p>He turned with the rain purling down his face to see Armstrong,
who had quickened his step to keep pace with him. For a moment, he
didn't recognise him. Then he said,
   <p><squote>That's very civil of you. No, thanks. I'll just imagine I'm
doing a cross-country run. I'll change when I get in.</squote>
   <p><squote>As you like,</squote> said Armstrong, and was about to turn into a
side path but Melville, thinking that he might have felt snubbed,
said,
   <p><squote>Come this way &mdash; then you can cut across.</squote>
   <p><squote>I used to play rugger,</squote> said Armstrong. <squote>I missed it when I
gave it up.</squote>
   <p><squote>How old were you?</squote>
   <p><squote>Thirty-six,</squote> said Armstrong. <squote>I'm fifty-four now.</squote>
   <p>To make conversation, Melville asked a few questions about his
family and South Wales. He liked his cadenced voice, his easy,
undeferential manner and his pleasant, open face with the blue scar at
the side of his head.
   <p><squote>You're having a bad time,</squote> said Armstrong.
   <p><squote>In Africa?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes.</squote>
   <p><squote>It's pretty bad.</squote>
   <p><squote>Well, I'm sorry for you, lad,</squote> said Armstrong.
   <p>They walked along without speaking with the rain streaming down
their faces, and Melville wished that he had learned to know the
Opposition back-benchers better. He wanted to talk to Armstrong, but
he had difficulty in finding the language and so they walked in
silence. But the leaves gave off a warm, soaking smell, the pain in
his head lifted, and he felt refreshed.
   <p>
   <p>He changed his suit in his dressing-room into which a bed had
been moved, and then knocked on the door of the main bedroom.
Elizabeth was sitting propped up against the pillows, wearing a pale
blue bedjacket over a white nightdress. Broome was sitting at her
bedside, and greeted Melville with a broad smile.
   <p><squote>She'll live,</squote> he said. <squote>Don't let the head-dress worry you.
She likes wearing it. Thinks it makes her interesting. I'll look in
tomorrow.</squote>
   <p>When he had left, Melville stood by the window, looking out at
the street, and Elizabeth turned her face into the pillow. After a
minute of silence, Melville said,
   <p><squote>Elizabeth &mdash; I must talk to you.</squote>
   <p>She didn't answer, and he faced her. On her bandages, there was
a trace of blood; her cheeks were pale; and her eyes had heavy violet
shadows beneath them. She was looking straight in front of her as she
answered in a flat voice,
   <p><squote>I have nothing to say to you. You are a very wicked person.</squote>
   <p><squote>I have something to say to you,</squote> he said savagely, sitting on
the bed and taking her wrists in his hands. <squote>I want to know &mdash; I've
got to know &mdash;</squote>
   <p>She turned her eyes on him, and said in the same flat voice,
   <p><squote>If you say again what you said last night, I'll kill myself as
soon as you leave the house.</squote>
   <p>He slowly let go of her wrists and rose from the bed. His gaze
still held her expressionless eyes, and he withdrew to the door.
   <p>Then he went to his study, his certainties complete. It was
done, and nothing could ever change it. Nothing. Ever. He looked at
a photograph of Elizabeth and himself taken on the Terrace a few years
before, and suddenly, covering his face with his hands, he began to
weep, the tears trickling through his fingers as they had done in his
childhood when his father had died and there was no comfort in the
whole world.
<head> CHAPTER TWELVE</head>
   <p>After lunch two of the Prime Minister's grandchildren who had
sat, rather intimidated by Ormston and staring at the Grinling Gibbons
carving around the fireplace, rose gratefully from the table, leaving
the two men together. A nurse came in, and asked the Prime Minister
if he wanted to be helped out on to the lawn, but he waved her away
impatiently. The Prime Minister was wearing a grey suit and a white
shirt with a soft collar, but his neck had become thinner and the
collar stood away from it as if it had been bought haphazard. His
face had a jaundiced colour, and his cheekbones were red, touched with
a feverish cosmetic. Only his voice was unchanged; it was slow and
thoughtful with its familiar, rehearsed calmness. He crumpled his
table napkin, and laid it on a plate.
   <p><squote>I see no urgent anxiety,</squote> he said at last.
   <p><squote>Perhaps I can put it this way,</squote> said Ormston, <squote>and now I'm
seeing the situation purely as Chancellor. Our reserves are low, and
are getting lower. I feel rather like a father whose child is
bleeding to death.</squote>
   <p>His simile disturbed him; it evoked other associations, and he
hurriedly drained the glass of water. The Prime Minister said
nothing, and Ormston continued,
   <p><squote>Let's leave out the political merits of the situation.</squote>
   <p><squote>Is that possible?</squote>
   <p><squote>For the sake of my hypothesis &mdash; yes. I'm thinking for the
moment in plain, economic terms. We can't afford to increase our
costs in Africa &mdash; we simply can't afford it. I don't mean just our
direct military costs. I'm thinking of the African Boycott which is
already working up. I'm afraid, Prime Minister, you're not going to
like the trading position when you see it.</squote>
   <p><squote>I never do,</squote> the Prime Minister commented wearily. The
Chancellor was repeating an argument which he had already developed
for an hour before lunch.
   <p><squote>It comes at a bad time,</squote> said Ormston. <squote>A singularly bad
time. The Party's very restless, you know.</squote>
   <p><squote>It's a sign of life &mdash; very encouraging!</squote>
   <p><squote>The younger men &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Which ones?</squote>
   <p><squote>The younger ones like Gore, Vaughan, Hadley, Prebble,
Lambert-Price &mdash; the New Africa lot &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Do they confide in you? Have you spoken to them?</squote>
   <p><squote>Only at yesterday's meeting &mdash; they're very restless, Prime
Minister. They feel that it's very old-fashioned &mdash; shooting down mobs
of natives. They're very much afraid that if the Opposition get a
Commission of Enquiry some rather dismal stuff is going to come
out.</squote>
   <p><squote>Young back-benchers are always restive when they're bored,</squote>
said the Prime Minister, and for the first time since his
grandchildren left the table, he smiled. <squote>Why don't you give them
something to play with?</squote>
   <p><squote>They've found their own toy,</squote> said Ormston, <squote>and this is it.
They want to abstain next week.</squote>
   <p>The Prime Minister continued in his flippant tone,
   <p><squote>Tell the Chief to give them a talking-to.</squote>
   <p>The Chancellor closed his eyes, and then said,
   <p><squote>I think it's gone beyond that, Prime Minister. They feel pretty
strongly about Africa. They are greatly disturbed by the new and
rather ugly image of the Party which our African policy is creating.
On the whole, the country is still in favour of moderation and common
sense. Melville has in a curious way made us look old-fashioned &mdash;
extravagant &mdash; nineteenth centuryish &mdash; almost cranky.</squote>
   <p><squote>Don't you think the British public has reveries of Britannia's
strong, firm hand?</squote>
   <p><squote>I think the British public doesn't dislike force provided that
it's short, sharp and rewarding.</squote>
   <p>They both laughed and felt relaxed. Then Ormston frowned and
went on,
   <p><squote>What the British public doesn't like is violence that's
protracted, messy and expensive. At that point, you get a moral
revulsion against force &mdash; especially if it makes taxation rise. I
must tell you, Prime Minister &mdash; we're heading for an ugly crisis &mdash; and
I'm obliged to say this &mdash; Melville has a very heavy responsibility in
this matter.</squote>
   <p><squote>What could Melville have done to avoid all this?</squote>
   <p><squote>Well, obviously,</squote> said Ormston, taking up a pair of
nut-crackers, <squote>he boobed by talking to Julia Drayford &mdash; and that was
the start of the whole thing.</squote>
   <p>The Prime Minister looked puzzled, and said,
   <p><squote>Julia Drayford? How does she come into it? I can't follow
these complexities &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>It isn't quite that. The whole business blew up from
Melville's disgraceful indiscretion to Julia Drayford in Mrs.
M'landa's presence. I don't know the exact chain of gossip or who
told who what.
<QUOTE>

<text id=LOBK04>
As he turned aside his head, since he could not bear to look at her
beautiful, pleading face, he was suddenly attacked by suspicion.
   <p><squote>You wish to marry someone else!</squote> he cried in a voice
roughened by jealousy.
   <p>She sighed deeply, and looked away.
   <p><squote>Do you? Do you?</squote> he repeated, fiercely.
   <p><squote>If,</squote> she said gently, giving him a look that set his pulses
throbbing, <squote>if I wished to marry some young gallant, do you think I
would ask your help? You would be the last man I would ask.</squote>
   <p>Before he could collect his wits to reply to this, there was a
bustle and confusion at the end of the room. Prince Doria had wearied
of his toy and was packing it away in its painted coffer.
   <p>The party was now preparing to see the tapestries, and in the
general movement, Vittoria was separated from Orsini. Although
neither of them wished to follow the sightseers, there seemed no
alternative. As she was about to mount a wide and shallow flight of
marble stairs, she became aware of someone watching her intently, and
turning in that direction, she saw Olimpia, standing beside her
admirer, Orlando Cavalcanti. The young man was bending over her with
the assiduity of a lover, but the girl appeared to be more interested
in her cousin's wife, whom she was regarding through half-closed eyes.
This was a slight shock to Vittoria, who had forgotten the existence
of the girl, and, up to this moment had been unaware of the young
man's presence at the \palazzo.
   <p><squote>Are you enjoying yourself, Olimpia?</squote> she asked idly,
tapping the girl's cheek lightly with her fan, in passing; but she did
not wait for the answer. Disturbed by vague uneasiness, she was
wondering whether Olimpia had been watching her talk with Orsini.
Surely she could not have overheard anything they said? A moment's
reflection reassured her on that point, for she was certain no one had
been standing near them. However, something inimical in the girl's
look put Vittoria on guard. <squote>Santa Maria! These spying eyes!</squote>
she thought, bitterly.
   <p>Doria was continually stopping on the way, to point out, with
childish pride, objects of beauty or interest. Vittoria, on the
fringe of the party, caught snatches of this information, which held
no interest for her: <squote>... now this sapphire ... I like to think it
may have fallen from the dark hair of the Empress Messalina, as she
crouched in terror in the gardens of Lucullus, awaiting the sword of
the executioner.</squote>
   <p><squote>Ah!</squote> exclaimed Farnese, with a snigger. <squote>The old cuckold
Claudius had the last word, after all. He knew how to deal with an
adulterous wife, eh, Orsini?</squote>
   <p>If the duke made any reply to this, Vittoria did not hear it.
   <p>Now they entered the long gallery where they dispersed and
wandered around, admiring and commenting on the glowing hues and
barbaric splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought back from
Lepanto. After a short interval, Orsini found an opportunity to
rejoin Vittoria.
   <p><squote>We must talk further,</squote> he said in a low urgent voice.
<squote>Where?</squote>
   <p><squote>Be careful,</squote> she whispered from behind her fan. <squote>Olimpia is
watching us. The young man with her is Orlando Cavalcanti,
Francesco's friend.</squote>
   <p>Orsini shot an impatient glance at the couple. <squote>The young man
with the mole?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes, indeed.</squote>
   <p><squote>No matter. They are not looking at us. Now I must know,</squote> he
whispered, <squote>what you meant, cara mia. Do you want your freedom
in order to marry?</squote>
   <p>Before replying to this, she glanced hastily around, then spoke
in tones so low that he had to bend his head to hear: <squote>I will never
be any man's mistress. As to marrying again ... if I were free ...
there is only one man I would wish to marry ... but ... he, like
myself, is now bound.</squote>
   <p>With a swift gesture she closed her fan and moved away from him
towards the group in the centre of the gallery, leaving him standing
alone, against that glowing, barbaric background, with a deeply
thoughtful expression on his face.
<head>Chapter Six</head>
   <p>On a bright unclouded morning a few days after the visit to the
Doria Palace, the cardinal's coach left the villa, lurched over the
unpaved track and turned towards the ruined Baths of Diocletian.
Vittoria, accompanied by her maid, Lucia, was on her way to the
Accoramboni villa, ostensibly to pay a daughterly call on her father,
actually to coax money from that indulgent parent to settle her
mounting debts. Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress looked,
and how cunningly the olive-green dress with its underskirt of
rose-brocade fitted her perfect figure. Vittoria's thoughts were more
complex.
   <p>The sparkling society of the Doria Palace, the flattery of
Orsini's obsession, the thwarted ambitions of her restless spirit, all
threw into sharp relief the contrast of her grey life with the
splendid one that filled her dreams. At the Villa Montalto she felt
an alien, and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco to give her
a separate establishment, he invariably pleaded his financial
dependence on his uncle, who had built the villa for his family. He
reminded her that they must abide by Roman custom, and dwell there
with their relations.
   <p>Her values were those of the materialist who assesses every human
being in terms of fame, power and wealth. Francesco she despised for
his dullness, his lack of initiative, his subservience to his uncle.
Her husband's gentleness and amiability, his unselfish love for her,
she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a futile creature who had
not even proved capable of giving her a child. Whatever passion she
had experienced in the first months of marriage had been ousted by
contempt. She had never loved him.
   <p>Her thoughts rushed to Orsini. Since the meeting in the Doria
Palace, no word had come from him, and this silence oppressed her
spirits with a weight of misgiving. She had, perhaps, demanded too
much. The kiss in the garden had plumbed unsuspected depths in her,
and she knew that if she yielded to him, her passion could, indeed,
match his. Every instinct urged her to surrender, for there was that
in his nature to which her own had responded as it had responded to no
other human being. Prudence, ambition and reason had held instinct in
check, and they must dictate her course. There could be no
compromise.
   <p>For a brief interval she allowed herself the luxury of dreams.
She began to imagine life at Bracciano, the balls and f&ecirc;tes, the
conversation of poets and dilettanti. She visualized the pageantry of
the tournament, and herself on the ducal dais beside Orsini, placing a
chaplet of roses on the brows of some young conqueror in the lists.
   <p>This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a sickening jolt
and came to an abrupt stop, nearly throwing the two girls from their
seats.
   <p>Lucia uttered a cry of alarm.
   <p><squote>Look, madonna, we are surrounded!</squote>
   <p>It was true. Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about them
and a lean, swarthy fellow was peering through the window, grinning
impudently.
   <p><squote>Santa Maria!</squote> shrieked Lucia. <squote>\Banditti!</squote>
   <p>Vittoria now realized that they were outside Santa Maria degli
Angeli, and that except for a few beggars crouching in the doorway of
the church and exhibiting loathsome sores, the area was deserted.
   <p><squote>They are not \banditti, Lucia,</squote> said Vittoria, pointing
to the badge on the man's shoulder. The words were clear. <squote>Beware
my hug!</squote> Lucia stared speechlessly at the golden bear; Vittoria
swiftly averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance of the
retainer. Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic.
   <p>The coach now turned in another direction, towards the wild and
desolate region behind the baths. It was sparsely inhabited, dotted
with fallow fields and terraced vineyards, and here and there jutted a
brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins, a pathetic reminder of Rome's
former greatness. In this region of Monti most of the public baths
had been built in the time of the Caesars, but with the breaking of
the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions the baths had lost their
purpose; they had become stone quarries and their precious marble had
been burnt for lime. Now escaped criminals and bandits used these
quarries as hiding places, to the danger of travellers in the
district.
   <p>As they lumbered past at a rattling pace, Vittoria could see a
wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a gypsy encampment and a few
tatterdemalion creatures gathered about it, cooking their frugal meal.
These were left far behind. An old man belabouring an overladen
donkey, and a withered crone appeared on the horizon, were overtaken
and forgotten. Except for their escort, Vittoria and Lucia might have
been the only living creatures on an empty planet.
   <p>After the initial shock, Vittoria felt calm. She knew exactly
what she wanted, and was prepared to take it without scruple, if she
could. What she had forgotten in her self-absorption in her own
schemes was that other people were equally absorbed in their schemes,
which were likely to run counter to her own. This move today was a
reminder of that fact.
   <p>Whilst she automatically patted the hand of the agitated Lucia,
her brain was working rapidly, and she decided that she must be
prepared to counter Orsini's demands, difficult though that would be.
   <p>She became aware that the pace was slackening; now the coach
stopped. The moment had come. Upon the ensuing interview the future
would depend. Outwardly she was calm, but her heart was beating fast,
and the palms of her hands were damp. Orsini's high-crowned hat with
its jaunty plume blotted out the light; his hand was on the door.
Glancing at Lucia he said in French to Vittoria: <squote>Your maid ... is
she reliable?</squote>
   <p>She shrugged her shoulders, and replied in the same language:
<squote>Yes. But make it worth her while.</squote>
   <p><squote>I see. I know how to deal with people like that,</squote> and
turning to the cowering Lucia, he spoke in her own language. <squote>Do you
know who I am?</squote>
   <p><squote>No, signor,</squote> she whispered.
   <p><squote>I am the Orsini. My word is law in Rome.</squote>
   <p>Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat.
   <p>Thrusting his head farther into the coach, he said sombrely:
<squote>Have you ever heard of a punishment called the cord?</squote>
   <p>She blanched and shrank away. Was there not a street near Sant'
Angelo called the Lane of the Corda where criminals were hoisted by
their wrists forty, fifty, sixty feet into the air, and dropped again
and again, until their arms were wrenched from their sockets.
   <p><squote>You have heard of it? The Orsini give that to traitors. There
is no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini. We hunt a traitor down to
the ends of the earth, and no power can save him ... or her. Do you
understand?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes, signor,</squote> she faltered.
   <p><squote>On the other hand,</squote> he continued, giving her a keen look,
<squote>the Orsini are generous to those who serve them faithfully.
Remember that, my girl.</squote>
   <p>Lucia was beyond speech.
   <p>He turned to Vittoria, sitting erect, with flushed cheeks and
eyes sparkling with anger. <squote>And now, madonna,</squote> he said smoothly,
<squote>we will continue the conversation started at the Doria Palace. Be
pleased to alight.</squote>
   <p><squote>I think,</squote> she replied coolly, <squote>I prefer to stay where I
am.</squote>
   <p><squote>In that case,</squote> he reverted to French, <squote>I shall be obliged to
lift you from the coach.</squote>
   <p>Without answering him, she rose, and bending over the agitated
girl, said softly: <squote>No one will harm you, Lucia. Remain here.</squote>
   <p>Ignoring his proffered hand, she stepped from the vehicle.
   <p><squote>Will you be so good as to order your men not to molest my
maid,</squote> she said coldly to Orsini.
   <p><squote>She is absolutely safe,</squote> he replied; but he turned,
nevertheless, to the man who had peered into the coach, whom he had
addressed as Luigi, and gave him sharp instructions on the matter.
   <p>Vittoria stood looking about her, breathing the scent of thyme.
The land at her feet sloped away into a tiny valley beyond which, on
the crest of a wooded hill-side, the ruins of a small temple were
etched against the clear blue of the sky.

   <p>LONDON Airport was an impressive monument to the air age.
Its stately, although modernistic lines, made it a dignified portal
to the capital, though visitors had to overlook various prefabricated
buildings that were still in use. The immigration officials were
courteous ambassadors, too. Vera, though international in outlook,
could not help feeling parochial pride in the way they handled the
passengers.
   <p>She had not told Sir Arthur Nicholas the exact time or date of
her arrival and so there was no car to meet her. But she did not
regret it. In the large airport bus she had a better view of the
London she had not seen for over two years.
   <p>Nor had she told her parents that she was coming. It would have
been too much of a disappointment to them if her plans had changed.
   <p>For the first few hours she felt like a foreigner in her own
London. It took time to become used to hearing so much English
spoken. The London she savoured as she sped towards the air terminal
was prosperous and sleek &mdash; so like the well-fed cats she saw sitting
in the gardens and on the doorsteps of the trim suburban houses lining
the way.
   <p>Yet it struck her as odd that the shops in the suburban shopping
centres resembled those of an English village. They were a reminder
of the time when the districts had been little hamlets before they
were swallowed up in London's vast sprawl.
   <p>She observed with approval that many stages of history were still
written in the architecture of London. There were a few streets of
opulent, Victorian houses, now sadly declining like gentlewomen in
straitened circumstances. There were rows of workers' houses built in
the late nineteenth century. Some, now cheekily painted in gay
colours, with pots of little trees on either side of the doors, had
become the homes of young artists or writers. Houses were like
people, she thought, sometimes up, sometimes down.
   <p>At the air terminal Vera hailed a taxi and gave the name of an
hotel off Curzon Street. It had once been a private home, and now was
a dignified discreet place catering for people who could no longer
afford to keep town houses. A few well-connected foreign scientists
were usually to be found there, a diplomat or two and American
tourists of the more conservative type.
   <p>Vera had never stayed in a London hotel of any sort before and
had at first intended to stay with her parents. But she decided she
could not face it. She must avoid outside distractions at all costs.
She must conserve her strength for the vitally important business
meetings in which she would be taking part.
   <p>London was like a sleeping princess, awakened to life and beauty
by the kiss of the sun. Often its attractions were veiled, hidden by
fog or dimmed by grey rain. But today the sun had broken through.
   <p>As her cab sped towards the hotel, she planned an itinerary. She
would visit her parents that afternoon. Tomorrow she would arrange to
see Sir Arthur. After that, her schedule would look after itself.
   <p>Her hotel room proved to be ideal for complete relaxation. It
was elegant and neat and Vera adored tidiness. As soon as the porter
had brought up her suitcase, she telephoned her mother.
   <p><quote>Vera! Where are you? How wonderful to hear your voice. Are
you really here?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, mother dear. I'm at Crewe's hotel. How are you? How is
father?</quote>
   <p><quote>Fine, apart from his lumbago. You can telephone him at his
office. He doesn't like it but this is a special occasion. When are
we going to see you? How long are you staying?</quote> The questions
tumbled out.
   <p><quote>Only two days, mother. I am here on business. I have a job
now. I'll come over in about an hour and tell you all about it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Is everything all right?</quote> Her mother's voice sounded
anxious.
   <p><quote>Quite all right, mother. Everything is splendid &mdash; never
better.</quote>
   <p><quote>Is Jacques with you?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote> There was a pause.
   <p>Vera knew at once that her mother was thinking there must be
something wrong between her daughter and son-in-law. She said
good-bye and telephoned her father who tried out his night-school
French on her, very slowly and correctly. Vera often made mistakes in
grammar when she spoke French but she spoke as fast as any
Frenchwoman. Her father could never bring himself to do anything
imperfectly. His favourite proverb was that if a thing couldn't be
done properly, it shouldn't be done at all. Therefore his French
would always be halting.
   <p>She telephoned Sir Arthur Nicholas and a crisp, cool, well-bred
voice asked for her name.
   <p><quote>Mr. Arzrumian's secretary. I would like to make an
appointment with Sir Arthur.</quote>
   <p>The secretary had been alerted to the impending visit of
Arzrumian. <quote>One moment,</quote> she said. <quote>Sir Arthur would like to
speak to you.</quote>
   <p>Thirty seconds later, Sir Arthur said, <quote>Welcome to London.
Come to the office about twelve and we can have lunch afterwards. Or
what about today?</quote>
   <p>Vera answered, <quote>I'd like to see my parents first.</quote>
   <p><quote>Quite right,</quote> approved Sir Arthur.
   <p>Vera's parents lived at Southgate and although the underground
service was excellent, Vera felt justified in indulging in the luxury
of a taxi.
   <p>The house was one of a terrace and was kept spotless. Her mother
often exuded, to Vera's sensitive nostrils, a smell of carbolic soap
and metal polish which were constantly in her hands. Hidden behind
the curtains, her mother had been watching for her arrival. As the
taxi drew up she ran out and hugged and kissed Vera. She held her at
arm's length. <quote>How is my little girl?</quote> she asked oblivious of the
fact that Vera was several inches taller. Vera felt that they were at
once on a far better footing than they had ever been.
   <p>Mother and daughter entered the house arm-in-arm and the
questions began. <quote>You're so beautifully dressed,</quote> she said and
added quite inconsequentially, <quote>can't you stay the night?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not this time,</quote> said Vera, <quote>I have to prepare some notes for
tomorrow. I have a very important business meeting.</quote>
   <p><quote>How is Jacques? I'm longing to meet my son-in-law. Are you
really happy with him, darling?</quote> asked her mother, gazing at Vera
searchingly. It had been her great regret that she had not been able
to attend the wedding in Hongkong. Vera wondered whether it was her
imagination or was there just a hint of hopefulness in her mother's
expression &mdash; did she wish to hear bad news? Vera's old irritation
with her mother returned for a moment.
   <p><quote>Everything is absolutely fine,</quote> Vera assured her. <quote>I have a
wonderful job. I am secretary to Mr. Arzrumian.</quote>
   <p><quote>Arzrumian?</quote> echoed her mother. <quote>Where did you meet him?</quote>
   <p><quote>In Paris.</quote>
   <p><quote>Does Jacques approve of you taking a job?</quote>
   <p><quote>Anything which makes money has his approval,</quote> said Vera,
tartly. Her mother said in scandalized tones that money wasn't
everything and thought how hard her daughter had become.
   <p>The Brandons were working-class, without much money but she had
never had to take a job. They had always managed and Mrs. Brandon
could afford to scorn other people's interest in money.
   <p>Her father arrived at six o'clock, a library book under his arm
as usual. After greeting him affectionately, Vera glanced at the
title. It was Religion without Revelation, by Julian Huxley.
<quote>Dear, serious Father,</quote> she said. She thought, <quote>How much I love
you.</quote> How many railway employees read books on philosophy? Her
father had given himself a first-rate education by reading good books
and remembering what was in them. He had left school at 14 but could
have held his own with the most educated people.
   <p>Vera had decided not to confide any of her business affairs to
her parents. She did not want them to worry about her. Neither was
daring nor held views beyond the rest of the people with whom they
mixed. It had given them quite a jolt when she had married Jacques.
Her mother was barely a generation removed from people who considered
that a foreigner in the family was not quite respectable.
   <p>Vera spent a happy evening. Her father proudly took her round
his little garden for, next to philosophy, gardening was his hobby and
every flower in the small rectangle was carefully watched and lovingly
tended. At last, it was time to say good-bye and both mother and
father escorted her to the Underground station. As Vera went down the
escalator she looked back and her parents were still waving to her.
She felt strangely moved at the sight of the two elderly figures
above her.
   <p>The train roared in with a rush of pungent air. Vera sat down on
her comfortable seat, closed her eyes and thought a little sadly about
her parents.
   <p>Green Park station was only a short walk to her hotel but the
streets had not yet been cleared. Several young women in eye-catching
well-made clothes stood at every corner. One or two spoke to each
other in French. An expensively dressed little man turned a corner
and approached Vera. <quote>How much do you charge, dear?</quote> he asked.
   <p>Vera looked contemptuously at him. <quote>More than you could
afford, my good man.</quote> She stalked on, wryly amused.
   <p>Reaching her hotel, she was overjoyed to find a huge bouquet of
flowers, with a vase placed beside it, already filled with water. On
the card was written: <quote>From <squote>Arsenic</squote> to Mrs. Vital, our
devoted secretary.</quote> So Sir Arthur was a gallant as well as a
shrewd businessman!
   <p>Next morning, Vera walked through the Park as far as Buckingham
Palace, and down to the ornamental lake. She found it exhilarating to
be back again. Although it was early in the year, tourists were
wandering about already. A group of people was watching open-mouthed
the sentries in their scarlet uniforms outside the gates of the
Palace. Americans posed for their pictures with the Palace as a
background. It was extraordinary how attractive Americans found
royalty and nobility.
   <p>She looked at her watch and decided it was time for her
appointment with Sir Arthur. There was no doubt Sir Arthur was
pleased to see her. No doubt, too, that he had been conducting a test
of <squote>Hairmone</squote>. His head was covered with coppery red hair which
made him look many years younger. It was about an inch long &mdash; long
enough for a crew-cut. <quote>I am very grateful, my dear,</quote> said Sir
Arthur, running his fingers through the thatch. <quote>I never thought it
would happen to me.</quote> If Sir Arthur had hesitated about going into
business with Vera, he was now her staunch ally.
   <p><quote>This,</quote> said Sir Arthur, tapping his head, <quote>is going to
convince that obstinate old buzzard, Eric Selby, to join us. He's a
hard-headed Yorkshireman and we need his advice. He's involved in
several of my business ventures but I have to twist his arm to make
him take on new commitments. That,</quote> said Sir Arthur, <quote>is the
penalty of success.</quote>
   <p>They left for the Savoy when Sir Arthur had signed more letters
and Eric Selby was waiting for them. He looked from Vera to Sir
Arthur and was astonished and amused at the same time.
   <p><quote>Arthur,</quote> he whispered on the way to the table, <quote>what's the
idea of the toupee? And why red?</quote>
   <p><quote>Toupee be damned,</quote> said Nicholas. <quote>I'll tell you about it
at lunch.</quote>
   <p>Vera sat opposite Eric Selby. She had already noted that he was
of medium height, very thin and gave an impression of greyness. Now
studying him more closely, she saw that greyness was the dominant
characteristic of the man. He had thick, rather long, grey hair.
<quote>Not a future client for <squote>Hairmone</squote>,</quote> she thought to herself.
He wore a grey Savile Row suit of exactly the same colour as his
hair. His eyes were greyish-blue &mdash; the colour of a winter sky. He
wore heavy framed glasses, which gave him a professorial look. If
accents have colours, his was grey, for he spoke with a north-country
voice.

<text id=LOBK06>
   <p><squote>What's that?</squote> she said, loudly, as if by speaking he had
released anger which she had been gathering against him all the time
he had been standing next to her. Keeping his face completely serious
Dr. Horn swayed two or three inches back then forward as if a wind
had struck him.
   <p>She took a deep breath and gave her thick neck and shoulders a
shake which she probably thought a convulsive shudder. <squote>If you're
suggesting that Martin isn't old enough...</squote> she said in a new low
voice of drama.
   <p>She found no difficulty in assuming for convenience that the
attack she had begun on Martin hadn't happened. He was ashamed of the
way she credited other people with her own short memory. He went past
them into the narrow hall. He hesitated at the stairs, knowing they
had turned to watch.
   <p>He needed some warning of what he would find. He could imagine
his mother saying later, <squote>If only I had had the sense to tell you
not to disturb him that first evening.</squote> He went past the cream
banisters, down the passage to the kitchen.
   <p>He stood near the gas cooker. Behind him in the hall the doctor
said, ~<squote>Mrs. Mason, I don't want to worry you...</squote> then they
passed into the sitting-room and closed the door. He had begun
quickly, as if, now that he had to talk, he must do it before she
could question him, bringing confusion to the subject. When Martin
stood in the hall he could hear him going on speaking to her, but not
what he was saying. He could hear his balanced speaking and the short
level snubs he gave her interruptions. He could hear the way that she
went on interrupting because she wasn't understanding that he was
snubbing her.
   <p>Presently she started to talk and he was letting her. They had
turned towards the door and he heard the doctor say, <squote>That's what I
said, Mrs. Mason.</squote> After she had said a lot more he said, <squote>No,
Mrs. Mason, that was not what I said.</squote> He went back down the
passage to the kitchen. When he heard her coming he went to the far
end of the deal table and sat against it with his back to the door.
   <p><squote>It's a stroke, that was what he was meaning. He wouldn't say
it, but I could tell.</squote>
   <p>Martin kept still, facing away. <squote>How serious?</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh, he wouldn't tell me that. Good gracious me, no!</squote>
   <p><squote>You can't remember anything he said?</squote>
   <p><squote>I tell you I can remember very well indeed...</squote>
   <p>She thought that as usual he was trying to make her seem stupid.
He wondered how to persuade her that she was wrong.
   <p><squote>I'll go up.</squote> He stood waiting, expecting her to stop him.
   <p>She said, <squote>This is the time we should have someone we could
trust.</squote>
   <p>He went round the deal table on the far side from her, down the
passage and upstairs. He wondered whether she might cry because of
this rude way he had left her and knew that if she cried she would
make it loud enough for him to hear. One of the triangular
stained-wood stair-rods had come away from its lacquered brass clip.
He didn't like to think how it had happened.
   <p>On the half-landing he stood near the porthole window. The
engine of the doctor's car revved loudly in the drive as if he
controlled it clumsily. The headlights came on, lighting up the
circle of window with the two-inch orange border. She had often
complained about his father's choice of doctor and knew now that she
had been right.
   <p>He understood why his father had chosen him. He could only bear
to have a doctor who did not take the absurd business too seriously,
who realized that the whole sad joke of men living for only seventy
years was made worse if you treated it as anything else.
   <p>On the upper landing he stood in front of his father's door, not
sure whether to knock. Something moved behind him.
   <p>She was standing halfway up the stairs, so that her head was on
the level of his feet. <squote>That's right,</squote> she said. He could not
think how she got there without making a noise. She usually went
upstairs heavily, lifting her knees sideways as if her feet were
weighted, frowning at the effort. She had never reconciled herself to
things which hurt her, and sometimes he was frightened that when bad
things began to happen she would have so little habit of optimism to
support her. Or perhaps she might never understand that they were
worse than going upstairs.
   <p><squote>What is it?</squote>
   <p><squote>That's right,</squote> she said, this time raising her arm in the
long-sleeved blouse to point. He opened the door and went in.
   <p>There was a low light on a chest of drawers. The two beds were
at the far end with their feet towards him, one flat, the blankets on
the other raised in a narrow heap.
   <p>His father lay on his back. His chest was curiously high and
sharp like a pigeon's. He wore a thin dressing-gown but most of it
was under the bedclothes. His face was white and a little shiny, as
if damp. It was turned away, so that for a second Martin thought he
was asleep, but his eyes were open.
   <p>His father didn't move his head but after a second he turned his
eyes. He seemed to make no effort to speak or even smile. Presently
he turned them back. Martin doubted if he had turned them far enough
to see him.
   <p>It was so unlike him that he could not understand it. He knew
now that he had expected his father to accept this with the same smile
that he accepted everything else. Suddenly he had an idea of how much
worse it might be, that his father was lying here alone and terrified
by what had happened to him.
   <p>He wanted to say something to prove it wasn't true. He put his
hand on to the bedclothes where he thought his father's shoulder might
be. There was something below and he pressed it gently, trying with
all his power to convey the sympathy he felt. His father gave no sign
that he had noticed. Perhaps it had been a lump of the pillow. He
went quickly to the door.
   <p>When he came on to the landing he heard his mother telephoning in
the hall below. <squote>Of course, he may have been feeling ill for weeks
and said nothing... Well, it would be just like Herbert... That's
right... Not at the moment, not one word... Of course, dear. As
soon as there's anything fresh... </squote>
   <p>
   <p>A nurse came three times a day and sat his father up to feed him.
He let this happen but had no appetite, and the plates she brought
down to the kitchen often had white mouthfuls of steamed fish which he
had chewed but not been able to swallow. It was difficult to tell
whether he was unable to speak or whether he could see no point.
Sometimes he started to say things in a hoarse whisper, looking ahead
as if there might be people to either side who would stop him, but
never got further than one or two words. Most of the time he lay on
his back with his eyes open. After three days there seemed nothing
Martin could do and he went to the office again.
   <p>They had given the speech to Burridge. They would be able,
later, when time had become a little confused, to explain his failure
by his father's illness, if they wanted to.
   <p>When he came home in the evenings he sat in the chair by his
father's bed. At first he asked cheerfully how he was feeling, but
these questions, left unanswered, seemed to lead only to the bad
answers they might have had. He did not like to talk about other
things, because he could understand their terrible irrelevance to
everything his father must be feeling, and knew, when he mentioned the
new morning schedules on the Alton line, that he was only showing him
how completely he was failing to understand. He had an idea his
father would have liked to hear him say hopeful things about his work,
but they would have been too different from his usual silence.
   <p>Sometimes he went away quickly, sometimes he sat for quarter of
an hour, saying little. The weather had changed and outside the
window strong winds swayed the heavily leafed chestnut tree in the
dark summer evening, sometimes showing the wet concrete of the house
next door, sometimes when the whole top was driven sideways by a
violent gust showing the grey clouds moving fast above. He wanted
badly to tell him how sorry he was for the hard, offhand way he had
sometimes behaved to him. He found himself more and more surprised
that any person could bear to be hard to another.
   <p>He thought of the years a long time ago when his father had
seemed happy. There had been a feeling of hope then which had gone
later. Things had not been settled in the poor way they later became
settled.
   <p>He remembered a time when they had gone to stay with the Bowerses
and Bowers had been building a mud wall, some rustic craft he had
discovered. He remembered the planks set up to form a mould for the
wet mud. Though he could only have been four or five he could
remember Bowers' enthusiasm and amusement, and how his father had
responded to this and how as they had wheeled the barrows of sloshy
mud they had sung songs which he now realized had been parts of some
opera they half knew and half could not remember. Bowers had sung the
male voice and his father the female, both doing it with great
seriousness which was half mock half real.
   <p>Later he could remember the vicious things his mother had said
about Mr. Bowers. He had not questioned that he must believe that
he had always been wicked. His father had not said these things but
he had not contradicted them.
   <p>He had been told that there had been a mistake and his father had
been blamed when it had been Mr. Bowers' fault. He could remember
how he had not been able to understand why his father did nothing
about this. <squote>But why don't you tell them?</squote> It had all seemed so
simple but his father had shaken his head.
   <p>After that there had been another job, then quite soon the war.
It sometimes seemed to Martin that this had been the best time for
his father. Being compelled to do a job which there was no point in
questioning and no chance of failing at had suited him.
   <p>When his father told stories about the war a curious happiness
came over him which the stories themselves did not explain. There had
been one about helping to break all the bottles in a bar in Cairo and
waking up there next morning laid out between two chairs with nothing
on but his boots, which his mother had particularly disliked.
   <p>Once his father had shown him a small automatic pistol from the
war and he had hoped for a moment to learn something exciting. <squote>Did
you capture it?</squote>
   <p>His father shook his head, smiling a little at something the
question had made him remember.
   <p><squote>Did you find it?</squote>
   <p>He shook his head again. <squote>Someone gave it me.</squote> Martin had
not liked to go on questioning him, suspecting that this would be an
intrusion on some private memory which he wanted to respect.
   <p>After the war his father had gone to his first advertising agency
but he had not liked it. There had even been a time when he had left
it to take up tutoring and there was still a box of school textbooks
in the attic.

<text id=LOBK07>
   <p>He fell morosely on the bed.
   <p>She came over and sat down beside him.
   <p>How old are you?
   <p>Twenty-four &mdash; and fully grown as others can tell you.
   <p>Well, I'm twenty-seven. Still young in years perhaps, but pretty
old in hours I can tell you. If I thought you were really in love
with me I'd never tell you, but as you're only in love with love I
will. You're inexperienced and that's the truth.
   <p>Thanks for nothing.
   <p>Don't get huffy. Why do men always think they're great lovers by
nature. To copulate is natural, to make love's an art.
   <p>And I'm no artist?
   <p>On the contrary! All men are, but, like all artists, they need
training.
   <p>I'll roll up at the Polytechnic.
   <p>Liszt and Tchaikovski were born geniuses but they had to learn
how to read and write notes.
   <p>Love's a natural act.
   <p>So's singing and dancing &mdash; but they still need training. To a
woman the preliminaries of love are the most important and that's
where art comes in. You have to learn what women like before you can
bring out the best in them!
   <p>I'd have thought that pretty obvious.
   <p>Don't be vulgar.
   <p>Isn't it vulgar to want... I don't know what things you do
want!
   <p>No. The body needs food &mdash; but you cook it to enjoy it as well.
The body needs physical love for many reasons but prefers it served
with attraction.
   <p>What else can a man do?
   <p>Boy, are you kidding!
   <p>Ah well, our love affair was short if not sweet.
   <p>You mean you don't want me any more?
   <p>Don't tell me you're willing to sacrifice yourself again?
   <p>For answer she pushed him back against the cushions and brought
her face very close.
   <p>Don't you want to kiss my lips?
   <p>Anger and desire fought within him, blow for blow.
   <p>Her red mouth came closer and brushed against his lips, light as
a feather. Her voice came soft and sweet as a marshmallow:
   <p>Just brush them like this and this... and this... you'll feel the
blood pulsing... don't attack a mouth as if you're dipping a mop into
a slop-bucket... always go much slower than you want to, it increases
desire...
   <p>And Desire came up with a straight left and Anger staggered...
Her lips parted and the tip of a pink tongue came slowly out and
caressed his mouth from corner to corner, deliciously slow, back and
forwards, slipping in a fraction of an inch and out again to the
rhythm of a drum that had started somewhere inside his head. Her
voice was a gentle murmur, caressing him with words that were as sweet
as they were naughty and nonsensical.
   <p>Desire followed up with a couple of nasty rights to the face of
Anger, who gave at the knees.
   <p>Her head moved slowly, her lips and tongue spoke a language he
understood without having learned it. Her tongue went in deeper and
touched his own, gliding round it, pulling it in and letting it go.
   <p>Desire uppercutted neatly and Anger took the full count.
   <p>He looked up into her eyes and saw the immeasurable depth of
eternity that God has put in there for man to lose himself in.
   <p>He'd taken over now and was looking down at her as she lay on his
bed. Her voice murmured on, soft and caressing as a kiss:
   <p>Look at my throat... don't you want to kiss it... to follow its
lines and taste my skin...
   <p>He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently led along
erotic paths which he knew existed, but had never trodden. He learned
how to use his hands, how to adore that body without haste, how to
caress every inch with his mouth as well, to creep down along her
smooth muscles till he lost himself in a rapture of kisses in places
he'd dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened his heart beat
to a thunder.
   <p>He looked at her. Head thrown back in a pool of hair, her
blood-red lips parted and the beating of her heart in the full throat.
   <p>Her mouth did things he thougt no human being could stand without
dying, but he went on living in an ocean of voluptuousness, that
swelled and ebbed over him, under him, in him and through him...
   <p>He was having a ball!
   <p>He twiddled the TV set with shaking hands. She sat calmly
on the bed smoking a cigarette.
   <p>His face was white with two red blotches. Hers was flushed and
lovely.
   <p>O.K. teacher! Was that any better?
   <p>You know it was! You don't need teaching, only a little coaxing.
   <p>He sat down and ran his finger down along her spine.
   <p>Do you love me now?
   <p>Like yesterday! I'm extremely fond of you. The fact that you're
beginning to satisfy my physical wants does not change that. Before
long you'll give me the satisfaction that'll set me rocking on my
feet, but I'll still be only fond of you.
   <p>But you wouldn't marry me?
   <p>No. I'm not your type. I'd make you miserable. I mean that.
I'd very probably be unfaithful and that'd kill you.
   <p>Then I'd be unfaithful too, to teach you a lesson.
   <p>It wouldn't work. You'd do it to spite me. I would never do it
for that reason. To me it'd be immaterial whether you'd retaliate or
not. You'd go crazy if that situation arose.
   <p>Pretty conceited, aren't you?
   <p>No, truthful. You're the faithful type. You'll marry a darned
attractive girl and you'll never tell her of me, but you'll be
grateful because you'll be able to give her all she wants by day and
night. And that's a lot, considering that 60 per cent of all
married women in the West never get full satisfaction. Mostly because
40 per cent never expect to get real pleasure out of it and are
convinced it's their duty to suffer the husband, and 20 per cent
because they never dare talk or do it by daylight. They don't dare
tell a loving husband they only begin to like it when he's already had
his fun and prepares for sleep. They don't dare tell him to find out
what she wants. They don't know that tastes differ just as much in
sex as in anything else. It's man's duty to find out and experiment.
   <p>O.K. Now look in your tea-leaves again and tell me what's
in store for yourself?
   <p>Have I never told you? End of the year I'm marrying Mason, the
sculptor.
   <p>
   <p>His affair with Charlie was the best period in his life so far.
   <p>Sheila, who was a disconcertingly observant little pigeon for all
her reserve and innocence, once hit the nail fully on the head when
she said he looked as if he had everything he wanted in life except
money.
   <p>That was true enough &mdash; for a while that is!
   <p>He'd thrown his pride to the wind and accepted Charlie's
superiority in seduction. And it was hard to imagine a prettier
teacher. Nothing gave him greater pleasure than to watch his
improvements in her face, when she would genuinely sigh and toss her
lovely head in sweet agony. To observe the colour rise in her cheek
and hear her breath come faster, to see the slight beads of sweat come
out on her glistening skin and see her move with uncontrolled rhythm.
To have her twist in an attempt to receive a caress he was purposely
withholding, to hear her deep-throated moan of full satisfaction and
feel her shivering, clawing surrender.
   <p>Not so dusty, she might say afterwards, drawing at a cigarette.
   <p>It's a wow! he said.
   <p>She kissed him motherly:
   <p>You just wait till you teach the girl you really love.
   <p>He didn't protest any more to say he loved her because he knew it
to be untrue.
   <p>Instead he said:
   <p>Will that be better?
   <p>She nodded:
   <p>It's man's nature to teach and to teach those we love is double
pleasure.
   <p>And she might add:
   <p>And don't forget to leave the lights on. You lose half the fun
when you fumble in the dark.
   <p>She had many direct comments like that. Once she quietly pushed
him back when he kissed her too fully and too soon:
   <p>Oi, not yet, you oaf. What do you think my mouth is? A
billposter's bucket to be plunged in at random?
   <p>He'd learned to laugh when something went wrong or the situation
became ludicrous, as when they were both caught in the raw when he'd
forgotten to lock his door and Derek had walked in unexpectedly.
They'd just had time to nip into the bathroom and stood there
shivering for fifteen minutes while their guest was smoking a
cigarette waiting for him. At last Derek got tired and left.
   <p>Just in time, erupted Charlie. If he'd stayed any longer I'd
jolly well have asked him to join us. I'm so darned cold I could do
with two men.
   <p>You perverted sex-maniac, you wouldn't dare.
   <p>Show me what you can do and I'll tell you if you need help.
   <p>
   <p>Once he came back to the subject of her marriage and asked her
why she was going to marry her sculptor.
   <p>Because I love him, of course. What do you think?
   <p>But he's a lot older, isn't he?
   <p>I suppose so.
   <p>What attracts you? It can't be physical?
   <p>Of course not! I love him for what he is &mdash; he's so great I'm a
bit scared of him &mdash; a woman must be a bit scared to be really in love.
   <p>That's why you could never love me?
   <p>Correct, ducky! You just wait till you meet the girl who thinks
you're a god. It'll make you feel like one!
   <p>You think that sculptor's a god?
   <p>Perhaps, in a way. All I know is that I need him.
   <p>He kissed the heart beat in her throat.
   <p>But how about the physical side? You're quite an erotic little
beast; can he satisfy that?
   <p>You youngsters always overestimate yourselves. You can take it
from me that he can and does. But even if he were impotent I'd still
love and want him. There are sides to me you'll never know.
   <p>Don't you feel guilty living with me?
   <p>Often! Don't you?
   <p>
   <p>Mary had married her bill broker some time ago and he now
shuddered when he remembered the clinical weekends he used to spend
with her.
   <p>He often used to try to imagine her reactions if he had once
treated her as he did Charlie, but his imagination failed.
   <p>The efficient little Mary would probably have called it a
shocking waste of time and told him to get down to business!
   <p>
   <p>Charlie, who was perfectly at home at all sorts of artistic
circles, had amongst others wangled him a membership ticket for a
small club for artists only. It was situated in the attic of a huge
old-fashioned house and lit by candle-light, which made it seem very
romantic through a glass of something or other and which made it
impossible to check bills very carefully.
   <p>Charlie and he sometimes went there for a meal and a dance. The
food was good and the three men in the corner made just sufficient
noise on a piano, an accordion and a set of drums, to enable the
patrons to cling together and call it dancing. There was never any
rock and rolling at the Chipsteak Club. Its members did not care for
physical exercise.
   <p>There were a number of hostesses who changed constantly. They
certainly did not belong to the class of hostesses usually associated
with small clubs; on the other hand, many a member had often found
them very amenable if given sufficient time &mdash; and attention. Charlie
knew practically every one there, from the big Irish painter who sat
glued to his corner every night from opening at eight till closing at
one-thirty, to the latest addition to the staff of hostesses.
   <p>These girls soon lost interest in him when they found he was
neither a painter nor an assistant film-producer and left him alone to
contemplate the motley lot from a corner.

<text id=LOBK08>
She had forgotten that she had already told him about the man who
was the hero in another context that could not, by any stroke of
circumstance or fate, be linked with what she had now concocted. It
had been calculated to place her in a romantic light, but all it did
was to make her seem more pitiable &mdash; and for that he could have hated
her. He liked her brash and vulgar, the teller, as she had
occasionally become, of dirty stories, because it was as chummy and
uncomplicated as being with another man in a bar.
   <p>He didn't take her home that night; he made the excuse &mdash; lies
were contagious things &mdash; his car was in dock. Instead, he telephoned
for a taxi for her &mdash; which he would pay for when he saw her into it
outside.
   <p>While they were waiting for it, she said, <quote>Have you met your
neighbour yet?</quote>
   <p>They were in the entrance hall, and a car had driven up, out of
which stepped a grey-haired woman in a Persian lamb coat &mdash; but it was
not his neighbour, not the one Thornie meant. For a moment, he had
thought it was, but that woman was less tall and also younger.
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p><quote>Seen her about at all?</quote>
   <p><quote>Now and again.</quote>
   <p>The taxi came, and before Thornie got into it, she kissed him.
   <p><quote>Give my love to your mother,</quote> he said.
   <p>His distinguished neighbour had never been alone when he had
encountered her in the corridor. There was always her chauffeur with
her, and sometimes her maid. He had not even wished her good
morning &mdash; as was the polite custom between the tenants. She looked
too damn haughty every time, with her head held high &mdash; and in her
spiked heels she was taller than himself. Her eyes never once cast
him the merest glance. Sometimes she affected the smoked sun glasses
with the big blue frames she'd worn the day of her arrival.
   <p>But the morning after Thornie dined with him, around midday, he
met Mrs. Longdon-Lorristone coming from the lift with the chauffeur.
They had barely passed him when he heard her tell the chauffeur she
had left something in the car, and that he was to go back for it, she
could manage. <quote>I'm here,</quote> she said, <quote>and I've got my key.</quote>
   <p>As the chauffeur walked quickly past him, James looked back, and
he saw her standing by her door, fumbling with the key. She was
carrying a big black crocodile bag, and she had a parcel as well. He
saw the key fall from her hand, and her stooping to pick it up &mdash; and
he heard her swear. He went back, retrieved the key for her, and
opened her door with it.
   <p><quote>Oh, thank you!</quote> she said. <quote>I don't think I know your
name?</quote>
   <p><quote>It's Longdon,</quote> he said, <quote>I am a new neighbour of yours.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh! I have heard of you. Thank you so much. But &mdash; won't you
come in?</quote>
   <p>He looked at his watch; he would be late for lunch down-town, but
perhaps his guests could cool their heels for a little while. One of
them was trying to interest him in launching a literary magazine &mdash; and
there was no possible future in it, in a country with a population the
size of Australia's. The maid appeared, and took the parcel from her
mistress, who said, <quote>Leave the door, Frances. Mathew is on his way
up again.</quote> And then she said, <quote>Oh, do come in, Mr. Longdon,
unless you are in a hurry.</quote>
   <p>Her flat was pretty much what he had expected; the apartment of a
rich woman of taste, and his eye immediately alighted on a Degas. He
remarked on it, and spoke of having seen her gift to the gallery.
<quote>My son,</quote> she said, <quote>has a Renoir, one I gave him when he married
the first time,</quote> as other women might speak casually of having given
their sons a car they had no further use for.
   <p><quote>Oh, do please sit down!</quote> She raised her voice then, and
called out, <quote>Frances, bring the sherry, please.</quote> She sat down in
a wing armchair, and when the decanter and two glasses were brought on
a round silver tray, she said, <quote>Will you pour your own, please, and
one for me?</quote> James did so, and when he had put the glass into her
hand, she said, <quote>Will you please bring up the little table. I am
stiff about the joints. I drop things &mdash; as you saw.</quote> And she
proceeded to tell him about her arthritis. He did not sit down; he
stood with his drink, sipping it, and studying her from top to toe &mdash; a
woman remarkably well-preserved for her age, who might easily pass for
one much younger. Beyond the mention of her disability, she gave
nothing else away. Very correctly, she was handing out the polite but
casual hospitality due to a new neighbour who had rendered her a small
service. Challenged more by her correctness than by any encouragement
to talk of any topic beyond the weather and how long he had been in
Melbourne, he said, <quote>You know my flat, don't you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Naturally, Mr. Longdon! Wasn't that a rather superfluous
question?</quote> But she smiled.
   <p>He took his leave of her then, and they shook hands. Hers was
thin and bony, and very narrow across the knuckles. She did not get
up from her chair.
   <p>He did not encounter her again in the corridor, but he thought
about her over the next ten days. Once, when her door was open to
admit a caller, he heard the radio on; and he heard it, again, late at
night, muffled through that closed door and the supposedly soundproof
wall.
   <p>Then he telephoned her early one morning, and asked her if she
would come and have a drink with him that evening, or any other that
suited her. She said she was sorry, she couldn't that evening, and
she so very rarely went out in the evenings now. It was a decided
rebuff, although her voice itself sounded pleasant enough, not cold
and stiff, or off-putting.
   <p>He said, <quote>It's not intended to be a party.</quote>
   <p><quote>No? But all the same, if you will forgive me. It is very kind
of you to have asked me.</quote> And then, when he would have rung off,
she said, <quote>I suppose you have changed the flat a lot? I know you
bought the furniture, and I imagine you've turned it round, because no
one else's arrangement ever suits one, does it?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've changed nothing,</quote> he said, <quote>except I've got my own
books and I've got the desk by the window, instead of in the middle of
the room.</quote>
   <p><quote>That should be an improvement. It was always too big for the
centre of the room, but Sir Eric liked it that way. I think it gave
him the feeling of being in his office &mdash; and more at home.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then, won't you come and see it all?</quote>
   <p><quote>Sometime, perhaps. I will let you know.</quote>
   <p>He had avoided Thornie in her role of femme fatale, but
she went to a great deal of trouble to find him a book on old
Melbourne, which he'd casually told her he wanted to read and not been
able to find in any library. She had finally unearthed it at the back
of a second-hand bookshop, without any cover to indicate its title or
its value to collectors, and she left it in a parcel on his doorstep
one day when he was out. She must have hoped to find him in, as there
was no letter with it, only an obviously hastily-written message on
the outside, <quote>With Thornie's love.</quote> So he asked her out to
dinner, and they were back where they were before she concocted that
fairy tale.
   <p>Almost the first thing she said, was, <quote>There's a girl lodging
with Mrs. Hogg who Stephen Longdon-Lorristone brought home one
night. What do you think of that?</quote>
   <p>He couldn't think of anything, and so he said nothing.
   <p><quote>She works in the hairdressing at Longdon's, and he got her the
job. He picked her up somewhere.</quote>
   <p><quote>That sounds very kind of him.</quote>
   <p>Thornie laughed. <quote>Oh, you men! Always stick up for each other,
don't you? His kindness extended to taking her out to dinner and to
his house for a drink after and bringing her back. Mrs. Hogg saw it
all.</quote>
   <p><quote>What did she see?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, I suppose them in the car together, and she didn't like it,
even if it was milord. The girl's only a kid when all's said and done
and from up-country too. You'd think he'd know his onions a bit more,
wouldn't you, than to carry on like that? He may find his wife cold.
She looks it. A good-looker, mind you, if you care for that English
type. I don't often go down on the ground floor, but we get the usual
discount on what we buy and I was getting stockings one lunch hour
when she came through with all the kids in tow. It was the end of the
holidays, and I suppose she was getting them new school clothes. She
never wears a hat. That's very English, and it's caught on. Once no
Toorak woman would have been seen dead down-town without a hat on.
They used to look &mdash; and some of the old ones still do &mdash; as if they'd
got a lunch date with the Queen.</quote>
   <p>He wanted to say to her, <quote>Don't spread that story, Thornie.</quote>
But he wasn't her keeper; neither was he the guardian of the
reputation of the Longdon-Lorristone family. He wasn't, as she would
have said, in their league. Among the acquaintances he had made &mdash; and
he had made a good many by now &mdash; there was not one who could claim to
know the mother, the son, or the daughter-in-law, other than by
repute.
   <p>About a week after hearing that piece of gossip from Thornie, his
doorbell rang one night, shortly before nine o'clock. The sound of
it, in its discreet little buzz, interrupted his reading. Putting
down his book, he went to the door, opened it wide and saw that the
caller was Mrs. Longdon-Lorristone.
   <p><quote>I've taken you,</quote> she said, <quote>at your word! Although I think
the suggestion was that I should telephone you first? But if you are
not alone, and I have come at an inconvenient hour, I will go away
again.</quote>
   <p><quote>Please come in,</quote> he said.
   <p>She stepped over the threshold, partly leaning on a stick, and he
shut the door behind her. In his surprise, speech had momentarily
almost deserted him. He had been deep in his reading, and in another
century, another world, and the adjustment to the present one had been
slow to come. He was associating her with the character of a
Byzantine empress, with conflicting tragedies being enacted over her
head, Nemesis catching up with her, punishing her for her ruthlessness
and selfishness and her passion for getting her own way. But what he
saw was an ageing, hesitant Australian woman in her slow walk from the
front door to the living-room, where she paused and said, ~<quote>It is a
great improvement,</quote> meaning, he presumed, the desk he had moved near
the window. He drew up a chair for her, and took her stick away, and
offered cigarettes, asking if she would have a drink. She refused the
drink. Then, disarmingly, she said, <quote>I suddenly felt lonely. My
maid is out.</quote> She laughed. <quote>I found I was out of cigarettes too!
Perhaps I smoke too much!</quote>
   <p>It was the opening for a little discussion on the minor vices, as
two shipboard companions might talk while occupying long chairs side
by side. There is nothing like the shared confession of silly
weaknesses to set a ball rolling. That was only the preliminary, for
she wanted to know all about him; not quite all, she was too polite,
but the outline of his past, which he gave her as he had given it to
Thornie.

<QUOTE>
You have seen it. The big white hat, the white swallow-tailed coat
with the shiny braid, the ridiculous cravat &mdash; in action he looks like
a Southern planter at a picnic. His stock of bottles was all set up
on the wagon. He hadn't yet begun to sell them. He had to inveigle
his audience first...</squote>
   <p>How I wish I had been there. These forests of the Congo could
have seen nothing like it. The bland, self-assured voice enveloping
his spectators in a cocoon of honey: commercialism seemed to be the
last thing he had in mind. He'd started his show. He had to seek the
lowest common denominator of the audience. He was doing card tricks.
Tossing out the aces, then picking them out of mid-air. It might
have gone down well up near Lake Chad, where there is an Arabic
influence &mdash; on these denser sons of Ham it had no effect at all. He
went swiftly on to cigarette tricks. That was better. The audience
hummed. Father Felix told me: <squote>How he did it, I do not know. He
puffed at a handful of lighted cigarettes, threw them all into the
river and then retrieved them one by one from behind the ears of the
crowd. They rubbed their heads confusedly to see where they came
from. How does he do it?</squote>
   <p><squote>Why didn't you watch?</squote>
   <p><squote>I did. He drew a lighted cigar from out of my cassock. How
embarrassed I was.</squote>
   <p><squote>It would have been interesting to see him try it on Agnes.</squote>
I spoke prematurely: he had something more dramatic for her in mind.
   <p>And all the time that facile enchanting patter... it was a kind
of enchantment, wasn't it? <squote>It was impossible both to listen to him
and watch him closely,</squote> said Agnes. <squote>In the end we didn't really
hear what he was saying, nor see exactly what he was doing with his
hands.</squote> Which suggests a very expert patter.
   <p>There is the moment when the mass tension of an audience has
suddenly to be heightened &mdash; the magician, like his brother the
demagogue, must know when to turn the screw. Agnes said: <squote>Of
course, he wasn't paying me any particular attention. But he was
aware of me in the crowd. I had no wish to be drawn into his
mumbo-jumbo...</squote>
   <p><squote>Agnes, can we forget the personal aspect for a moment? What
did he do?</squote>
   <p><squote>He produced a white chicken from his props. He held it up. It
fluttered and squawked. He said to it: ~<quote>Go, little bird,</quote> and
flung a cloth over it. When he whisked it away the chicken was gone.
He began to call out, ~<quote>Little bird, where are you?</quote> and came down
from his wagon as if searching for it in the crowd. He stopped by
me &mdash; I hadn't the faintest idea of his intention &mdash; he slapped suddenly
at my skirt, and I swear to you I felt with horror the flapping
feathers between my legs. The chicken escaped from under me and I
heard everybody hissing with shock. It wasn't enough. He had to
embarrass me further &mdash; he picked up an egg as if it had been freshly
laid.</squote>
   <p><squote>I've seen that trick performed in the Bobino in Paris...</squote>
   <p><squote>The natives have never been to Paris. The effect on them was
staggering.</squote>
   <p>Father Felix said disturbedly: <squote>One mustn't take liberties with
people who are so susceptible to magic, ~What makes us laugh &mdash; these
music-hall illusions &mdash; can literally petrify them.</squote> Did it matter?
The chief and his wives, his sons Shadrach and Meshach, had
approached the fringe of the crowd. Joe Moses opened up a large
coloured box to show that it was empty. He called out:
   <p>~<quote>What shall we have for supper? ~Sucking pig?</quote> and persuaded
one of the women to throw a cheap bangle into the box. More
incantations. He tossed the box over the heads of the crowd. It
burst open as it landed and a young pig squealed and ran out into the
forest.</squote>
   <p>I haven't seen that one in the Bobino.
   <p>Then swiftly the pi&egrave;ce-de-r&eacute;sistance &mdash; after all,
he had to get down to the business of unloading his bottles. He must
have prepared one of the boys: the young black imp popped gigglingly
into a crate. That one I have seen. A few mock pistol-shots into
it. A sabre slammed fearsomely through it in all directions. The
natives suddenly expectant of tragedy &mdash; but the crate opened and the
young imp of mischief came waddling out.
   <p>Agnes said with sudden pleasure: <squote>But he'd been too smart.
He'd undone himself. When he started his sales talk...</squote> and she
began to mimic him ironically: ~<squote><quote>My friends, I have here the
age-old remedies of the famous Shoshone Indians, the essences that
made them strong and virile...</quote> nobody in the crowd would even
glance at his bottles. It was as if he'd bewitched them. They were
frozen into inertia. He went about trying to interest them in his
Shoshone cure-alls, but he might have been addressing black statuary &mdash;
it was quite uncanny, his face fell. When he'd gone the rounds he
hadn't sold a single bottle.</squote>
   <p><squote>Hoist with his own petard,</squote> I said.
   <p><squote>I didn't like it,</squote> said Father Felix. <squote>There was something
about the tribe that troubled me.</squote>
   <p><squote>Joe Moses, too. Sales resistance troubles every business man.
What did he do with his bottles?</squote>
   <p><squote>Emptied them into the river. He was very angry.</squote>
   <p><squote>Perhaps the fishes'll grow as strong and virile as the Shoshone
Indians. Still, it must have been a wonderful show.</squote>
   <p><squote>He made a wonderful fool of himself,</squote> Agnes said.
   <p>
   <p>It was fate, in fact, that was making fools of all of us. I said
before that the stage had been set &mdash; it awaited the last theatrical
prop. The curtain was now ready to go up. It only needed my personal
attendance. I arrived with thirty soldiers and a display of armaments
in three flat-bottomed river transports the following afternoon.
<head>Chapter Four</head>
   <p>These weren't the Kano \gendarmerie. They were soldiers.
Nothing as alarming as Caesar's centurions &mdash; even with Springfield
carbines it's difficult for thin black shanks and tarbooshes to strike
terror into the heart. But they were the best of our native levies.
French N.C.O.s can whip neolithic African bowmen into military
shape. It had given the Governor a bad half-hour of heart-burn before
he decided to send them. They were equipped with a few light
automatic weapons and tear-gas grenades. In command of them was a
cold \sous-lieutenant, a veteran of the Indo-Chinese war. I think
he rather hoped for a small brisk action. He paraded his troops at
the fringe of the village.
   <p>Like the schoolmaster's cane, every civilian administrator has to
keep the idea of the military instrument at the back of his mind &mdash;
but, when he first sees light machine-guns being assembled, his
stomach goes cold. The \sous-lieutenant was placing them
strategically at the end of the street.
   <p>And a silence fell upon the village. Nothing moved: not a child,
not a rooster. Father Felix had seen the platoon marching by the
mission. He came hurrying out.
   <p>He cried: <squote>But I never dreamt you were serious.</squote> It was the
nearest thing to rage I'd ever seen in him. Agnes came palely behind.
   <p><squote>They've made it serious for me, haven't they? Did you think I
warned them so strongly just to exercise my voice?</squote>
   <p><squote>Louis, you cannot know what you are doing...</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm doing my duty as I see it. It's that perverse chief. He
has forced my hand.</squote>
   <p><squote>It is utterly unforgivable.</squote>
   <p><squote>It's easy for you to talk.</squote> He was making me feel both
stubborn and guilty. <squote>If anything goes wrong, there's nobody but God
to blame you. I have the Governor to contend with. If he jumps on me
I'm out of a job.</squote>
   <p><squote>But they have guns. Look.</squote> He pointed. He couldn't believe
his eyes.
   <p><squote>You must think I like the military sticking its nose in.</squote> I
said bitterly: <squote>We spend our lives running things the quiet way.
Then the army arrives &mdash; a blow, a false word &mdash; bang &mdash; suddenly there
are shots. All right. If that's the way they want it. But don't ask
me to clean up the mess.</squote>
   <p>Agnes said: <squote>Get those soldiers out of sight at once.</squote>
   <p><squote>They haven't come here to play hide-and-seek.</squote>
   <p><squote>If they come a solitary step nearer...</squote>
   <p><squote>Nobody wants to precipitate trouble. They'll stay where they
are.</squote> Father Felix tugged incoherently at my sleeve &mdash; he took a
step towards the two light automatic weapons perched in the dust at
the end of the street. The \sous-lieutenant had an eye for
positioning. Suddenly one realised exactly what was meant by
<squote>covering fire</squote>. I felt almost as nervous as Father Felix. I
dragged him back. <squote>Are you mad? These are disciplined soldiers.
They aren't Christians.</squote>
   <p><squote>What?</squote>
   <p><squote>Your cassock wouldn't save you. If you interfered with them
they would fire.</squote>
   <p>He said impatiently: <squote>As if that matters...</squote>
   <p><squote>It matters to me. The Governor would assassinate me.</squote> I
stared beseechingly at Agnes. She said to Father Felix: <squote>Be
still.</squote>
   <p><squote>I have the Governor's written orders,</squote> I said. <squote>We're to
move the tribe out of the valley with the minimum of force...</squote>
   <p><squote>How small is minimum?</squote> asked Father Felix. He'd begun to
sweat.
   <p>I wasn't answering that one. <squote>All inhabitants are to be
prepared for transit, all stocks, herds, movable goods. Compensation
will be paid for unavoidable...</squote>
   <p><squote>Stop waving that abominable paper in my face. I don't object
to them going. I only want them to go voluntarily.</squote>
   <p><squote>So do I. I don't want them to have to swim. Will you show the
chief the orders?</squote>
   <p><squote>I have a tongue.</squote> He stalked off. I was in bad odour
with him. I watched the \sous-lieutenant deploying his soldiers
through the trees. Agnes said coolly: <squote>You mean well, Louis.</squote>
Thank God for small encouragement. <squote>But you're a foolish busybody,
if there are two ways of doing a thing, you'll always choose the wrong
one.</squote> That wasn't so encouraging. She went striding briskly
towards the chief's hut.
   <p>The village had become of a sudden thronged. There were too many
men: I strained my eyes, for the dazzle of the sun was painful and
perspiration wetted my lashes, to see if they bore weapons. Children
howled. An old woman advanced a few paces to shake her fist
virulently in my face. I brushed her off like a fly. Yes, there were
shields in the crowd. Except for hunting, they hadn't used bows and
spears since the mission had been planted in the valley: and now they
were banging the stretched hide shields, it sounded like the boom of
an approaching herd. The chief in his white coat was talking
excitedly with Father Felix...
   <p>...and sweat, sweat like cold needles, sprang out on me.
Something nosed like a gun-barrel into the small of my back. I
jumped about. That wretched beast, the elephant, breathing
inoffensively not a pace behind me. How silently it moved. Joe Moses
sat atop of it. I peered up emotionally and said: <squote>Do not ever do
that again.</squote>
   <p><squote>Your nerves are in bad shape.</squote>
   <p><squote>Yours would be, too. Remove that creature from me. It
smells.</squote>
   <p><squote>So the marines are here.</squote>
   <p><squote>What? Yes, the soldiers. It's the only way.</squote>
   <p><squote>When does the battle open?</squote>
   <p><squote>You're mad. This doesn't concern you. Go away.</squote>
   <p><squote>You don't listen, do you?</squote>
   <p><squote>To you? Who would?</squote>
   <p><squote>I told you, a man doesn't have to be big, doesn't matter if he
has a belly,</squote> and again he surveyed me with cold languor, <squote>so long
as he has the sap in him to command respect. I should have qualified
it. He has to have brains in his head, too. Remember what I said?
About not shoving a mule to water when ten sweet words will coax it
along?</squote>
   <p><squote>Your &mdash; what do you call it &mdash; cracker-barrel philosophy makes me
sick.</squote>
   <p><squote>But better sick than dead.</squote>
   <p><squote>They're a very obtuse people. There comes a time when one has
to show strength.</squote>
   <p><squote>Suppose they resist you with strength?</squote>

<text id=LOBK10>
He had raised his voice above normal to address his friend.
   <p><squote>I would be delighted to show Mrs. Egerton my collection,</squote>
Theodore replied. <squote>Perhaps you would all come and have tea with me
this week? Perhaps &mdash; Thursday?</squote> He looked from Sylvie to Sonia.
   <p><squote>Could you then?</squote> asked Sylvie.
   <p>Sonia thought rapidly. Harold would be absent in Salonika for
some days; this made the arrangement of her own timetable much
simpler.
   <p><squote>I shall look forward to it very much,</squote> she said.
   <p><squote>And bring your icon with you,</squote> added Andr&eacute;.
   <p><squote>We'll pick you up on the way,</squote> said Sylvie.
   <p>There was a movement behind them and Hugo, who had disappeared
for a moment, reappeared carrying a chair, which he placed beside
Andr&eacute; and invited him to be seated.
   <p><squote>But, my dear boy &mdash; we must be going!</squote> exclaimed Andr&eacute;.
<squote>Very kind of you &mdash; but we're the last. Of course we could stay
here talking and browsing among the books all night but I don't think
we'd be very popular.</squote>
   <p>They looked round the room to discover that they were indeed the
last there, except for the two men employed to keep an eye on the
books and rearrange them after the visitors had left.
   <p>They dispersed in the entrance but Sonia accepted a lift in
Andr&eacute;'s car, which dropped her at her flat.
   <p>Harold had not returned. She wondered uneasily where he could
be, but since he rarely told her his plans this evening was no
exception. She could not understand the nervousness that sent her
wandering through the rooms, into the hall, back again into the
drawing-room, out on to the terrace, until she was suddenly able to
pin down its causes. Magda's face hovered against the darkness,
disembodied, panic-struck; she could not eliminate it. She was afraid
and could only hope that the girl had gone home to Erich who loved
her, however hopelessly.
   <p>The afternoon which had begun so promisingly with the friendly
laughter in Andr&eacute;'s flat and the new acquaintances she had made
through the French archaeologist, had turned sour since Harold and
Magda had put their acid into it. She had also been made restless by
the sight of Andr&eacute;'s and Sylvie's pleasure in one another's
company. Envy mingled in her mind with regret for what she had missed
and saw no chance of reaching in life. She wished she were old but
with their security.
<head>CHAPTER 5</head>
   <p>ALTHOUGH she did not look forward to the occasion Sonia found
it impossible to avoid an evening at Magda's flat, especially since
Erich had pleaded with her so anxiously to do what she could to
befriend the girl, who tended to shut herself away completely from
society and not only made them both unhappy but also damaged his
chances of promotion by doing so, social life being part of their
duty. Harold was to join them straight from the office as soon as he
could get away. For once she was glad that he would be with her,
because she wanted a chance to observe him with Magda in order to
discover what was in his mind and how far she was under his control.
The few minutes at the book exhibition had seemed to show that the
girl was already dominated by him and ready to submit to all he
suggested. They must have been meeting fairly often and she now
believed that when Magda had left them after the bathe near Cape
Sunion her appointment must have been with Harold. There was still a
flicker of rebellion in her, however, and Sonia hoped to encourage
this tiny flame.
   <p>She walked over to the flat across a patch of uneven waste land
that lay neglected between two blocks of modern houses. Poppies and
coltsfoot grew in profusion, giving colour to the dreary area, and
somewhere in the grass there must be edible leaves, for two old women
bent over the ground plucking them and stuffing them into paper bags.
She looked closely as she passed and saw that they were collecting
dandelions and nettles. The women must have come far, for they were
poorly dressed and did not belong to the prosperous neighbourhood.
They looked up as she passed and, noticing her eyes, filled with
curiosity, one of them said: ~<squote>Salad!</squote> with a grin and waved a
bunch of the tough, dark-green leaves at her. Were they driven by
poverty alone? By thrift? By avarice? She did not know, but the
contrast between these two dark, bent figures collecting the hard,
dusty weeds and the flowering gardens of plenty around them remained
in her mind's eye for some time and put her out of humour even before
she had reached Magda's flat.
   <p>The young people had contrived to import some of their
possessions from Germany and the flat was delightful with its
golden-yellow cherrywood and ebony Biedermeier furniture and one or
two modern pieces, including a rocking-chair with a high back that
Magda had purchased after visiting an exhibition of pieces from
Denmark some months earlier. As far as the plan of the flat was
concerned Sonia felt at home in it immediately, for it had been built
on the same scheme as her own and she knew exactly where kitchen,
bathroom and bedroom lay, a disconcerting impression to have in a
house she had never entered until that evening. An air of fussiness,
however, was added by the innumerable little lace mats that covered
almost every polished surface.
   <p>Magda and Erich were both awaiting her. He had arranged to come
home a few minutes earlier than usual and hurried forward eagerly to
welcome her. His gratitude was painful and made her ashamed of her
own lack of genuine warmth. It also, to her dismay, made the
isolation into which Magda was gradually forcing him even more
evident. Sonia and Harold coming to dinner was nothing more, after
all, than a normal friendly event among neighbours, all more or less
of the same age, and constantly drawn together through the various
cultural and social activities in the city, but his attitude seemed to
make a special occasion of it.
   <p><squote>Tomato juice?</squote> he asked.
   <p><squote>I added lemon juice to increase the vitamin content,</squote> said
Magda proudly.
   <p>He brought her a glass and placed it carefully on one of the
little mats, then carried one over to his wife.
   <p><squote>I don't know whether Harold will care for this,</squote> he added
uncertainly.
   <p><squote>It will do him good,</squote> Magda declared decidedly.
   <p><squote>Magda doesn't think alcohol good for the health,</squote> said Erich
apologetically. <squote>But this stuff's delicious, isn't it?</squote> he added
eagerly.
   <p>Politely Sonia agreed. It was, too &mdash; ice-cool. But she could
not imagine Harold drinking it.
   <p><squote>And what have you been doing since we met last time?</squote> she
asked Erich, more by way of starting a conversation with him than from
a desire to know.
   <p>The smile died from his face. <squote>I've had rather a dreadful
job,</squote> he said. <squote>I don't know &mdash; .</squote> He hesitated.
   <p><squote>It won't interest Sonia!</squote> said Magda swiftly.
   <p>If this were the only objection, Sonia felt obliged to encourage
him.
   <p><squote>Do tell me,</squote> she said. <squote>I know it isn't always fun having
to work in an Embassy &mdash; I used to think it was one long cocktail party
and an occasional exchange of <quote>Notes</quote>. The notes always made me
see a little billet doux on mauve paper being handed over in
deadly earnest by one imposing Ambassador to another, equally serious,
both wearing all their decorations, of course!</squote>
   <p><squote>It isn't quite like that,</squote> Erich smiled. <squote>No &mdash; this time
I've been working on the German war-graves on Leros and other islands.
The relations &mdash; you know &mdash; they want to know where their boys are
buried and then they come out to visit them to lay wreaths. And they
all pass through our office or the Consulate. Sometimes pleasant but
moving experiences and sometimes very disheartening.</squote>
   <p><squote>These are \Dienstgeheimnisse!</squote> Magda interrupted. <squote>You
know you mustn't talk about them.</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh, I don't think I'm betraying any secrets,</squote> said Erich.
   <p><squote>No, there was even a note about the graves in one of the
British papers recently,</squote> said Sonia. <squote>But in any case, my dear,
don't you think you could leave it to Erich to know what he may talk
about and what not? After all, it's his job!</squote> she added
impatiently.
   <p>Erich gave her an astonished look in which gratitude and alarm
were mingled. He was so comical that she almost laughed.
   <p><squote>He's not a child,</squote> she added. <squote>And it's his profession.
And he must be pretty good at it or he wouldn't be here in Athens
already, but sitting in some awful little place in South America or on
a Somerset Maugham kind of island in the Pacific. You with him!</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh, but I'm not so good as all that!</squote> Erich contradicted
nai"vely. <squote>But my father is &mdash; er &mdash; well, rather influential in the
Party.</squote>
   <p><squote>Now, when I hear a German say <quote>The Party</quote> I always think of
the Nazis,</squote> Sonia laughed, <squote>but I know it isn't that. Which one do
you mean?</squote>
   <p><squote>C.D.U. of course!</squote> answered Magda.
   <p>Sonia sighed. <squote>I'm sorry,</squote> she said, <squote>but I don't know what
that means. Harold's tried time and again to <quote>put me wise</quote> as he
calls it, to European politics, but I never could remember what all
those various complicated initials stand for. It's almost as bad in
England in Labour Party circles, though. I remember a woman who used
to come to see my mother. She spoke only in initials. It was a kind
of private, secret language. She would say such things as: ~<quote>The
T.U.C. won't let the I.L.P. do so and so and the
G.W.R. and the N.U.J. have threatened to strike,</quote>
and &mdash; it was all Greek to me!</squote> she laughed. <squote>It's even worse with
the French! But I do think we could invent an abbreviated sort of
shorthand-speech for everyday conversation, don't you? I'm sure we
could!</squote>
   <p>Magda and Erich were staring at her dumbfounded, incapable of
knowing whether to take her seriously or not.
   <p><squote>For instance,</squote> she went on mischievously, <squote>when I arrive
you're bound to say, ~<quote>How do you do!</quote> and I'm bound to reply,
~<quote>Very well, thank you.</quote> Now we could shorten all that. You'd
say, <quote>H.D.Y.D.</quote> and I'd reply, <quote>V.W.T.Y.</quote>
Think what a lot of time we'd save in the course of our lives! We
could shorten sentences such a lot &mdash; for instance, if I now say,
~<quote>Isn't it a lovely evening?</quote> you know, before I've finished, from
my eyes and intonation, what I'm going to say. So I'd only need,
really, to begin, ~<quote>Isn't it...?</quote> and you could imagine the rest.
People talk far too much and say the same things over and over again.
I don't mean they're boring &mdash; the lovely evening isn't &mdash; but we could
take them for granted, couldn't we? We could have two languages &mdash; a
cypher one, and then the proper language for our few, occasional
original thoughts. They'd stand out on their own like jewels, then.
What do you think of my idea?</squote>
   <p><squote>I think it's very silly and impracticable,</squote> said Magda.
<squote>What would we do without all those formal aids to talk?</squote>
   <p><squote>Perhaps the tomato juice has gone to your head, Sonia!</squote> Erich
laughed. <squote>Would you like some more?</squote>
   <p><squote>Maybe it has.</squote>
   <p>Lightening their tone was not easy, she thought to herself. She
wondered what would do it. Then, suddenly, as she noticed the many
flowers in the room, she remembered that she had not brought any
herself but had something else as a gift for Magda.
   <p>She bent over to pick up her handbag. <squote>I didn't bring you
flowers, Magda, because I know you always have so many &mdash; we all do.
But I did find this little book I thought you might like.</squote>
   <p>Magda flushed. <squote>It was not necessary &mdash; .</squote>
   <p><squote>Of course it wasn't! It's the not-necessary things that are
the nicest!</squote>
   <p><squote>Open it, Magda,</squote> said Erich.
   <p>It was a small book about birds, with many illustrations showing
their various types of nests, from the clumsy casual untidy heaps set
together by storks on roof-tops to the exquisite feather-lined,
moss-bedecked enclosure of warmth and security made by the wren.

<text id=LOBK11>
   <p><squote>Oh, there's plenty of time,</squote> the forester said, and yawned
and stretched himself.
   <p><squote>Why do you wear those wellingtons when it's so hot?</squote> she
asked.
   <p><squote>I don't know, I always wear them when I'm out working. They're
useful, I suppose.</squote>
   <p>Then they were silent for a time. Mary shaded the sun from her
eyes and looked out over the valley. Julian watched the sawing. The
grass was very warm. There was not a breath of wind and the branches
of the tree were quite motionless. He saw that the forester had
closed his eyes and was breathing deeply.
   <p>For a moment, as the sawing stopped for the next pair to take
over, he heard curlews far above them on the hillside. He felt drowsy
and lay back again.
   <p>Some minutes later they shouted over for the forester to come and
take his turn once more.
   <p><squote>Hi, Johnnie! Wake him up, will you!</squote>
   <p>Julian sat up. The forester seemed to be fast asleep. Mary was
smiling and obviously waiting to see what would happen. Julian
realised that it was up to him to do the waking. He crawled over and
shook the foot of one of the wellingtons, but to no effect.
   <p><squote>Hit him!</squote> one of the men shouted.
   <p>Julian tapped him on the arm, and then pulled at his wrist, but
still there was no sign of life apart from the heavy breathing of his
chest.
   <p>A large stick, coming from the direction of the workmen, just
missed Julian and embedded itself in the turf. He looked round
angrily and then glanced at Mary who was watching him with an odd,
rather anxious smile.
   <p>Another stick flew over his head.
   <p>He stood up, and then knelt down again and shook the forester by
both shoulders, and then let go quickly as he opened his eyes and sat
up.
   <p><squote>They're calling for you,</squote> Julian said, moving back and
sitting down again beside Mary.
   <p><squote>Are they? Well, well!</squote> He waved towards the tree and then
stood up. <squote>You stay here, you'll be quite safe here, it won't be
very long now. You watch and see exactly where it falls! I'll go and
tell your friends to come up here with you.</squote>
   <p>He strode off down the slope.
   <p><squote>He's funny,</squote> Mary said, rather doubtfully. <squote>He can make the
trees do just what he likes, but he's no idea how he does it! He's
almost like an animal.</squote>
   <p><squote>And he doesn't care at all what happens to the trees, or why
it's happening!</squote> Julian said, feeling a need to criticise the
forester. <squote>You'd think he'd be more concerned about that sort of
thing, considering he's obviously such a good craftsman! He just does
what he's told to do. But he seems to do it very well, of course.
And do you remember how the driver said the woodcutters had gone, how
it was more like a factory, the way the people worked in the forest
now? Well, he was wrong! This man here must be as good a craftsman
as any, to know all about the felling like that! He must be one of
the old kind! I imagine he's lived out here all his life. Don't you
think it would be wonderful to live like that? You remember when I
said I'd come away from home to have a complete change, to break the
chain? And you asked me what it was I came away to find? Well, this
is the sort of thing I wanted to find! Somewhere where I could live
the sort of life this forester's living. His way of life is really
what I wanted to find. That sort of way of life. You know what I
mean?</squote> He looked round at her.
   <p><squote>I don't really. No,</squote> she said. <squote>But you just couldn't live
that sort of life! You're not that sort of person, are you? You
might just as well try to change the colour of your hair. Why ever
should you want that sort of life?</squote>
   <p>Julian wished he had not said so much, he felt foolish. He had
said it partly because he really did feel it, and partly because he
thought it would make her think more highly of him. This second
reason seemed quite absurd to him even before she had replied.
   <p><squote>You do like that kind of person, though?</squote> he asked her.
   <p><squote>How can I say?</squote> she said abruptly. <squote>He's a better sort than
Hanson, more honest and straightforward. I don't exactly find him
irresistible though.</squote>
   <p><squote>I don't think you quite see what I mean,</squote> he replied, as
Hanson and Elizabeth came up to them and sat down near them on the
grass.
   <p><squote>No, it seems I don't,</squote> she said, ignoring them.
   <p><squote>So it's coming down soon,</squote> Hanson said. <squote>What was he
talking about?</squote>
   <p><squote>Nothing much,</squote> Julian replied. <squote>Only that it's going to
fall just where you were. He's got it all worked out, or judged
rather, to the inch. We're quite safe here.</squote>
   <p><squote>It's lucky there's no wind,</squote> Elizabeth said.
   <p>The blond forester was busy at one end of the saw again. It was
difficult to see how much farther they had to go, but the other men
were no longer resting. They were standing back and watching
intently, some down at the cut, others up at the top of the tree.
   <p><squote>Did you tell him we disapproved?</squote> Hanson asked.
   <p><squote>I said I thought it was a pity,</squote> Julian replied.
   <p><squote>And what did he say to that?</squote>
   <p><squote>He didn't seem to know anything about it, beyond how to fell
it. Anyway, it's too late now to do anything about it.</squote>
   <p><squote>And what do you think you could have done about it before?</squote>
Mary asked him, quietly.
   <p><squote>I don't know. Tried to persuade them to leave it, I suppose.
They mightn't have known anyone cared about it.</squote>
   <p><squote>And why do you care about it?</squote> she asked, still completely
ignoring the other two.
   <p><squote>I suppose because it's taken ages to grow as perfect and
beautiful and tall as that, and because it only takes a few moments to
destroy it. And because it's impossible to create it again! It's a
fine sight, I'm sorry to see it go.</squote>
   <p><squote>It'll be a fine sight to see it coming down though, won't
it?</squote>
   <p><squote>Maybe,</squote> Julian said.
   <p><squote>Don't you think it's rather fine to see a man who doesn't even
know why he's wearing wellingtons bring down something as wonderful as
that tree? And for no reason at all, so far as he knows! But he does
it! I rather like that. He's really doing something big. Do you see
what I mean, I wonder?</squote>
   <p><squote>I don't think I do,</squote> Julian replied. <squote>I think it's very
exciting though to watch someone like that doing physically strenuous
work. I'd much rather he wasn't destroying something at the same time
though!</squote>
   <p><squote>I agree. It would be exciting, if it wasn't so destructive,</squote>
Elizabeth put in. She seemed to have very strong unspoken feelings on
the matter, judging from the way she was leaning on one arm and
staring down and nervously crumbling the dry earth of a molehill
beside her.
   <p><squote>Destructive! Destructive!</squote> Mary said sarcastically, turning
to her for the first time. <squote>What you'd call destructive, maybe! Oh
how unimaginative you all are!</squote>
   <p><squote>Mary, there's no need to indulge in this deliberate
spitefulness just because you're angry with yourself,</squote> she said
without looking up. <squote>Other people will only help you if you give
them a fair chance. And why did you speak to me the way you did, down
there? I can't understand, how can I tell what you're talking about?
What is it you're blaming me for now?</squote>
   <p><squote>Blaming you?</squote> Mary jumped up and stood bending towards her
sister. <squote>Don't you really know? Well, well! You needn't try to
pretend that I'm the only person who keeps things secret!</squote> She
stepped back and turned on Julian: <squote>My own sister scheming to get me
out in the country alone with a boy like you who's run away from his
mother and wants to become a blond-haired woodcutter! Oh, you
understand people so well! You're a fine man! A real man! You've
got real feeling!</squote>
   <p>These last words she directed at Julian in such a withering tone
that she seemed completely unable to say anything more. She turned
and walked away from them, across and down the slope. Julian stared
after her, dazed. He felt profoundly injured, and unjustly but
absolutely rejected. But this feeling of weakness quickly merged into
impotent anger. Mary had begun to run, but then she suddenly stopped
and stood looking back at them. She was too far away for him to see
any expression on her face.
   <p><squote>Hi, Miss,</squote> one of the foresters shouted to her, <squote>you'd
better move a bit or you'll get your pretty self squashed flat!</squote>
   <p>She gave no sign that she had even heard him.
   <p>They stopped sawing.
   <p>She's gone back to her old methods, Julian said to himself, she's
trying to bully me again, and I thought she'd stopped that sort of
thing! She's standing there expecting me to go and rescue her. She's
trying to force me to show some concern for her. She wants me to give
in and run to drag her away. She wants me to commit myself. Because
if I did go to rescue her she'd consider it absolute proof that I was
fond of her.
   <p>But I'm just not going to be forced like that! Anyway, what a
fool I'd seem to all these onlookers! They just think she's playing!
And she may be playing with them, but with me she's not! And she's
not hysterical now either. She's stone cold and determined. She
thinks she's got me on the end of a string. She thinks she's got me
helplessly in her power, but she's wrong!
   <p>He looked round. Elizabeth had one hand on Hanson's shoulder,
they were both staring intently at Mary. All the men were standing
watching her too, in exaggerated attitudes of impatience and
annoyance. Mary was standing in the patch of thistles.
   <p><squote>If only she wouldn't make such an exhibition of herself,</squote>
Hanson said, and Elizabeth tugged at his shoulder.
   <p>Then the blond forester looked over at the three of them. Julian
pretended not to notice, he knew he was expecting him to do something
about it. He felt suddenly afraid that the forester was beginning to
think it serious. He determined to remain completely aloof.
Deliberately he looked away, down over the manor.
   <p>He saw a dark circular mark spreading towards them across the
meadow. It reached the manor and a pillar of dust swirled high into
the air. Then the huge eddy swept up the slope, catching wisps of
grass and catching Mary's dress and snatching at her hair. Then the
lowest branches of the great fir tree quivered and swayed, and the
surging of the heavy masses of dark foliage spread upwards and shook
the whole tree as for a moment it became the violent centre of the
whirlwind. A shout sounded through the strange roaring of the wind
and the blond forester ran forward. Then the tree, suddenly calm
again, towered over. It hung a moment against the sky, and then
crashed to the ground, lashing into the turf of the slope. It rocked
and shuddered, and lay still.
   <p>Julian, who had watched in such helpless, petrified amazement
that he had been unable to move, ran forward with Elizabeth and
Hanson. The men clambered over the branches. Julian tried to force
his way through the foliage where he imagined Mary would be, but he
became entangled in the broken branches and could not get very far.
He felt his legs trembling. Then he climbed up on to a large branch.
Hanson was a little way beyond him, crawling underneath. Elizabeth
had run round to the other side of the tree. He climbed along the
branch to the main trunk, his hands getting sticky with resin and his
ankles getting scraped as he slipped on the bark.

   <p><squote>I want to marry you,</squote> he said. <squote>We will live for ever in a
little house by the sea.</squote>
   <p><squote>I want a big house,</squote> I said.
   <p><squote>I will give it you,</squote> he cried.
   <p>How can one answer such promises? Innocencio's words were
dreams.
   <p><squote>We will have some children with fair hair,</squote> he went on. <squote>It
would be lovely if you had some children.</squote>
   <p>At the time I did not know what to say, but have often remembered
Innocencio's dialect version of the song;
<quote>
   <p>Palomita blanca reluciente estrella
   <p>Mas chula y mas bella
   <p>Qu'un blanco jasmin &mdash; 
<QUOTE/>
   <p>I asked Innocencio about the crater I had seen from the
mainland, and the snowy peak I could even now see.
   <p><squote>Yes,</squote> he replied, <squote>Right in the middle of the island is a
huge volcano, a real volcano, quite as active as Vesuvius or
Stromboli. It is called the Bed of Empedocles, and the name is true
of this mountain, and of no other. We try to keep its activities
hidden; we don't often admit even its existence to anyone from the
mainland or even the other islands. When you see a glow in the night
sky and ask us what it is, we tell you it's a fire in the scrub. So
it may be, and very likely the olive trees are burning too; but what
has started the conflagration? We won't tell you anything about those
seething underground cauldrons that threaten to break through at any
moment, and occasionally do so!</squote>
   <p><squote>What does the pharos say, out there at the end of the jetty?</squote>
I asked.
   <p><squote>It flashes a message all night through, long after every other
lamp is out, but not a message of comfort. Keep away, it says, I am
alight, but so is the mountain! Keep away from these dangerous
shores. And from above the inland ranges, I shall be turned into
blood, cries the moon; and the stars wide-eyed with terror sink back
into their cavernous abyss.
   <p><squote>Last eruption the mountain burst like a Bank and flung millions
of pieces of money high into the air. They were scattered over a wide
area of the surrounding hills, and were eagerly searched for and
gathered up by people from the villages. Many a mattress and stocking
now bulges with that extraordinary gold. Such was the explosive force
that a few coins fell even as far away as England.
   <p><squote>But one never knows what a volcano will do next, so it is best
to say nothing about it.</squote>
   <p>Innocencio wandered away, his forehead clouded, as so often his
native peak, by the dark legends of his race. In the afternoon I went
out again, hoping to see him, but could not find the peaceful garden.
I was not far from it, though, for there was sea below me, and I knew
that the garden lay near that part of the estate which included a
strip of coastline edged with precipitous cliffs.
   <p>I was looking down on the beach; was it a festival, that so many
people were about? It must be the day of the sea-sports; my eyes
search the holiday crowd for Innocencio. Shall I recognize him in
this dazzling light? There he is! No, it is someone a little like
him. I look in other directions and then suddenly I see him; he is
walking with one of his companions, and talking of the contest to
come. He is ready for it, wearing his bathing-slip and bonnet. He
does not see me.
   <p>I am on the cliff-tops of my Uncle's domain; it is getting
towards evening, the wind has risen but there are no clouds, huge
waves are crashing on the rocks below. Spectators are gathered on the
opposite cliff, cut off from me by a chasm, and waiting for the chief
event of the sports. Here are townspeople and their visitors, with a
few rustics from the mountains inland. All at once a commotion stirs
them: Innocencio comes in sight round the headland, pulling a boat
with all his strength against the heavy sea. Will he ever reach the
bay? Time after time a powerful undertow sweeps him outward. Then
putting forth a supreme effort he rides inshore on the back of a ninth
wave and is flung beyond the drag of the out-rushing water. He cannot
be seen for spray, but a scream of triumph goes up from the watchers.
   <p><squote>It has never been done before!</squote> someone shouts in excitement,
<squote>No one else has finished the course. He has pulled all the way
from Galva &mdash; how many miles? &mdash; and in the teeth of a north-east
gale!</squote>
   <p><squote>Innocencio! Innocencio!</squote>
   <p>The cries of the people soar higher than the stormy tumult; he
has put them above Galva of the Grasshoppers, their rival port;
Innocencio is their hero for ever, and even the people of Galva will
praise him.
   <p>I look down into his boat, rocking now in a sheltered inlet; he
has brought from Galva where his sister lives a trophy without price.
In the distance and through tears it looks like two little brown
dolls, one bigger than the other and lighter in colour; then I see
that they are shoes from the feet of his sister's children, his elder
sister whose name is future and present and past. Are they made from
walnut-shells and the skin of mouse and mole? They prove that his
boat has been to Galva; they will always be his greatest treasure.
   <p>I look now into the heart of Innocencio; below the proud surf lie
images of the perpetual terror of earth and sea; first the twelve men
he saw frozen stiff in the stranded lifeboat; then more recently the
brothers from Lumio drowned in each other's clasp, the one trying to
save the other &mdash; dragged from translucent depths, so fast were they
locked that no one could separate their last embrace and they were
buried in the same grave; and finally the corpse he had seen
half-eaten by worms at the cemetery. His ribs still echo with the
horror of their tawny hue.
   <p>I open my veins to the east I open the veins of my arm with the
cut of a sliver of silicon. Blood pours out from the left flows out
till it reaches the sea goes on flowing pours inexhaustible through
the inexhaustible sea without chafe or pause till it surrounds the
island a line veining marble a red line in the green sea taut from my
arm making a long arm to his home circling the island a ribbon of
stain in the foam unmixing like a rusty chain to bind him in binding
his home so he never can go nor a boat's prow cut through a crown
renewed without end of mercurial metal from far-away gap whence it
flows only his tooth could mend the gap whence it flows only his
tongue lick up the stream at its source only his tooth and his tongue.

   <p>The Magical Aphorisms of Eugenius Philalethes.
   <p>
   <p>Next day I persuaded the Anchorite to come walking with me in
the same neighbourhood. The coast-scenery was so fine that presently
we stopped to look at it, gazing across a bay to the far side where a
line of jagged cliffs rose against the horizon.
   <p><squote>A year or two ago,</squote> said the Anchorite, <squote>a girl and I were
walking along this road. There was a spring-tide, gone down very low,
as it has to-day; and as we looked across at that rocky shoal in the
distance, we saw the towers and spires of a Gothic cathedral rising
above it. The tide had gone out so far that this cathedral, normally
submerged, was plainly visible.</squote>
   <p>While the Anchorite was speaking I looked out over the expanse of
the bay, and could almost behold the faintly-discernible architecture
that he described. Outlined against the sky, it appeared distinctly
to the mind's eye at least; and I could imagine that it had taken but
little carving of the rocks from which it grew, to turn nature into
art.
   <p>The Anchorite did not tell me who the girl was.
   <p><squote>Just where we are,</squote> he went on, <squote>the coast is so formed that
the water can't ebb as far as it does from the opposite side of the
bay. It's about dead-low now, and as you can see, there are only two
or three hundred yards of sand between the road and the water. Well,
as I was telling you, we were staring at the cathedral, which is
hardly ever uncovered, when a lady stepped out of the sea quite near
us. She appeared just where the sand dividing us from the water was
narrowest, that is, about opposite where we are now. She was tall and
fair and dressed in a robe of yellow silk, the colour between orange
and lemon. She came towards us, and we walked over the wet sand to
meet her.</squote>
   <p>My eyes had come back from across the bay and were now
concentrated upon the waveless touch of the nearer sea and shore. I
could all but see the yellow-clad figure standing at the water's edge;
and it seemed to me that there must have been other of her people &mdash;
sea-men and sea-women, with her or not far behind, though the
Anchorite said nothing about them.
   <p><squote>She spoke to us,</squote> he continued (and I could almost hear the
sea-woman's voice), <squote>telling us her name was Vellanserga, and
inviting us to go with her into the cathedral. I refused; but the
girl went, and was never heard of again.</squote>
   <p>I knew that if the same invitation had been offered to me, I too
would have accepted; and it showed how completely the Anchorite's
movements were in subjection to my Uncle's service, that he had not
done so.
   <p>Seeing that I was engrossed in meditation on his tale, the
Anchorite withdrew.
   <p>Storm is in the air, but distant. Does it echo, or threaten? Is
the air weighted by the melancholy of a tempest subsiding, or the
anxious hush that precedes its first assault?
   <p>On the sea floats a head in profile, of heroic traits, a collar
of violets encircling the severed neck. The flaxen hair, once
looped-up, is now spread upon a watery surface, and tilted by
recurring small waves. Some distant storm, surely, tore this head
from a ship's prow; and the wood still bleeds, oozing a purple growth.
   <p>The salty taste of blood, I mused, comes from the sea, which
being without colour, reflects a tint from the air above while turning
its red globes into sea-anemones; but blood has kept these as a dye.
   <p>Here is the end of the land and the beginning of a country under
the sea; an impalpable region stretches over the last of the earth and
extends a long way under water. It is said that our starvation is
their plenty; that in time of war here, down there reigns the deepest
peace.
   <p>In a douce air above stones and soil, one is not alone; mist is
blown out towards a silvered horizon, nothing perishes. Sometimes
there is a thickening, and a growing menace.
   <p>Round coastal rocks flows a true water, the authentic Atlantide.
It is not the peacock that divides two continents, shrill-voiced but
never terrible; nor that narrow and more deceptive iris strait; nor
yet the electric blue sweeping from Teneriffe to Tory, though a swish
from the tail of the same dragon.
   <p>Under granite the saints lie buried; here a monument measured to
human form still stands, there a tree takes shape from the bones
beneath, an honourable vessel. In yet earlier rock there pulses an
ancient sensual life, but the saints must be roused up first. Their
diadems are bright with Sunday flowers, already they lift head and
shoulders from their covering slabs. When they come alive and walk
their own realm, the kingdom of vegetation, then blood of beasts must
warm the older stones and power will wake from a deeper cave.

   <p>Hardly noticed by Vicky in her grief and her expectant
motherhood, the political scene in Prussia had greatly changed. It
was only after the birth of her second son in August, that she resumed
her old interests.
   <p>Fritz had shielded her from worry in the last weeks of her
pregnancy, but now with her second son thriving, delighted with this
strong and perfect child, Vicky's vitality renewed itself.
   <p>Fritz, she observed, looked harrassed. He seemed unwilling to
talk about current events, but her direct questions broke through his
reserve.
   <p>It appeared that Roon, the only conservative in the otherwise
liberal Ministry, had in accordance with the King's demand, drawn up
plans for an army reform, which the King approved, but the Diet did
not; whereupon the King dissolved the Diet, only to have the newly
elected one also vote against the reform. Furious, by this time, the
King dissolved the second Diet; and the third, although the majority
of its members were still in opposition to the King, suggested a
reasonable compromise.
   <p>In this crisis, Fritz who was at his wit's end, advised
acceptance, and the King then turned upon him, and declared that
sooner than step down from the stand he had taken, he would abdicate.
   <p>The abdication document was already drawn up, though not yet
signed.
   <p>Vicky listened aghast. They had never, she realised been more in
need of the Prince Consort's advice.
   <p><quote>The opinion in the country,</quote> Fritz said bitterly, <quote>is that I
am urging my father to abdicate, in order that I may step into his
shoes.</quote>
   <p><quote>What nonsense, oh, what nonsense!</quote> Vicky cried.
   <p><quote>It seems anything but nonsense to our enemies, my dearest.</quote>
   <p><quote>But who could want to reign under such conditions? How could
you make a success of kingship knowing your father was bitterly
resentful and hurt?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not all sons love their fathers, Vicky.</quote>
   <p><quote>But you do, don't you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes; though not as you loved yours. I doubt though, if our
opponents credit me with filial affection.</quote>
   <p><quote>What will you do?</quote>
   <p><quote>Refuse the crown if it is offered to me. Apart altogether from
my father's feelings, if I accepted it, it might well start a civil
war. If the worst comes to the worst, and the abdication paper is
signed, I shall stand down in favour of Willy.</quote>
   <p><quote>Which,</quote> Vicky said, <quote>would mean a Regency for many years,
and heaven only knows who would be appointed Regent. There must
be some alternative.</quote>
   <p><quote>The present Diet is trying to find a solution,</quote> Fritz told
her. <quote>I have said that I will offer no further suggestions, for any
advice of mine is suspect. Roon has sent for his friend, Otto \von
Bismarck, hoping that he may find some way to end the deadlock.</quote>
   <p><quote>Bismarck? Oh yes, of course, the Paris ambassador.</quote> Vicky
knitted her brows, <quote>Bertie of all people was talking about him, some
time ago. He said he had heard that this man was the hope of the
conservatives; that he was excessively able and ambitious. Bertie, I
gathered, thought he might be a very sharp thorn to us.</quote>
   <p><quote>Odd to think of Bertie being so well-informed,</quote> Fritz
commented.
   <p>Feeling rather proud of her brother, Vicky agreed. Bertie was
much more intelligent than most people supposed. Poor, darling Papa
had under-rated him, which was natural, as they were so very different
from one another.
   <p>Presently, she said:
   <p><quote>If it were not that we should be throwing poor little Willy to
the wolves, and depriving him of his father and mother &mdash; for you may
be sure that we should have no say in his upbringing &mdash; I should be
glad to go into exile. England would not be that for me, of course.
It is you... would it be grievously hard on you?</quote>
   <p><quote>I can imagine worse fates, and unless my father is pacified,
that is what it will come to. Willy would not be the first boy king
in history, and by the time he was old enough to rule, conditions
might have altered for the better. My darling, rather than risk a
civil war, we should have to give him up.</quote>
   <p><quote>Prussia might become a republic,</quote> Vicky hazarded. <quote>The
other States might be co-operative.</quote>
   <p><quote>That I cannot believe. As a whole, Germans are imperial
minded. No, they would insist on a king, if only a puppet king.</quote>
   <p><quote>Is there nothing we can do, Fritz?</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothing but wait. I have no influence over my father, and my
poor mother is in despair. Bismarck is expected to arrive in Berlin
tomorrow, and my father has agreed to receive him.</quote>
   <p>Vicky was silent, unable, though it shamed her, to resist weaving
a roseate dream. What joy it would be to return to England with
Fritz, and to forget these few bitter years as though they had never
been. Even if they had to leave poor little Willy in the hands of
those in authority here, they would have their two younger children,
and when everything had settled down, it might not be an absolute
parting from their firstborn. Victoria would use all her considerable
influence to prevent that.
   <p>It was a dream soon to be dispelled. The next day the King tore
up the abdication document. Bismarck promised him that given
authority, he would get through the army reform, whatever the
disposition of the Diet; whereupon the King conferred upon him the
title and position of Minister President and Foreign Minister of
Prussia.
   <p>Hearing this, Fritz and Vicky scarcely knew whether to be
relieved or otherwise. At least the immediate crisis had been
bypassed, and the King, worn out with the struggle was content to
leave the affairs of state in the hands of his new adviser.
   <p>Queen Augusta, who had hitherto seen little of Bismarck, but who
within twenty-four hours disliked him intensely, wept disconsolate
tears. Her influence over the King had never been great, but now it
was reduced to nil. The new President Minister bluntly announced that
he would not tolerate petticoat government, and in this he included
the young Crown Princess as much as the Queen.
   <p>He would serve the King, Bismarck said, but him alone, and he had
no doubt but that he could serve him to his satisfaction. He swore
that if the King relied on him, he would finally be not only King of
Prussia but Emperor of a United Germany.
   <p>Soon it was realised that the new Minister had an enormous
following and with the King's backing, his authority was paramount.
Within weeks, a new Diet, composed of those who slavishly believed in
him, was completely under his sway.
   <p>Fritz was treated as a weakling enemy. Vicky as his evil genius.
Unpopular before Bismarck came into power, she was now hated. This
hatred took the form of ignoring her whenever it was possible, and had
she not been the Princess Royal of Great Britain, and her mother a
powerful queen, she and Fritz might, she thought, well have been
banished from the country.
   <p>Vicky often wondered that she did not meet with an untimely end.
There were more ways than one of getting rid of an intransigent
princess.
   <p>But it was not Bismarck's policy to so inflame Britain that he
had a war on his hands. It was far wiser to treat Vicky as an
ignorant, hot-headed girl, and while appearing to tolerate Fritz, to
estrange the King from him by various subtle means.
   <p>Finally, however, Fritz was forced into open conflict with his
father.
   <p>Bismarck, though the Diet was now subservient to him, was
constantly criticised by the more liberal newspapers, and he
retaliated by passing an emergency decree, which effectually muzzled
the Press.
   <p>Now, no political opinion could be newspaper circulated without
the approval of the Minister President; free speech was annihilated.
On the other hand, any article in praise of him and his government
was given extravagant publicity.
   <p>Scurrilous attacks were made on Vicky. Nothing was too bad, or
too personally insulting to be written about her. There were now no
objections raised to her visiting England as often as she chose; the
hope was openly expressed that she would never return to Prussia.
   <p>Fritz, whose opinions and principles were outraged, and who was
furiously indignant on Vicky's behalf, came out into the open, and
when at an official reception at Dantzig he was asked outright by the
burgomaster if he had had any hand in bringing about the Press
Ordinance, he replied that he had not. He had, he said, been absent
from Berlin at the time, and had had no part in the councils which had
led up to it. His short speech which followed, showed clearly where
his sympathies lay.
   <p>The burgomaster's question had come as no surprise to him; he had
been warned before the reception that he would be challenged, and
Vicky, who was with him, had implored him to make his position plain.
   <p>They had their own following, she argued, though it might be a
minority following, and Fritz owed it to them to show that he was not
involved in this disgraceful measure.
   <p>Within hours the storm broke about their heads. The King
threatened to cast Fritz off altogether. The Queen Augusta wrote him
an hysterical letter, in which she confusedly sympathised with him,
reproached him, and laid all the blame on Vicky who was proving
herself no friend to her adopted country.
   <p><quote>I am not, I suppose,</quote> Vicky said sadly. <quote>Not to this new
Prussia, which is changed and demoralised. You would be better
without me. Even some of your real, true friends doubt me; they think
you have wedded not only me, but my country; and they would rather put
up with this devilish Bismarck than run the danger &mdash; they think it is
a danger &mdash; of being Anglicised. I don't blame them in the least. I
know how repellent it is to me to be Prussianised. I should never
have loved you, or wanted to marry you, had that been your
attitude.</quote>
   <p><quote>Thank God, it never was,</quote> Fritz said. <quote>All I hoped was that
you would bring the fresh air of your country, to blow upon the
cobwebs in mine.</quote>
   <p><quote>I haven't sufficient breath for that,</quote> and Vicky smiled
wryly. <quote>Oh darling &mdash; I feel so hopeless. Sometimes I am afraid they
will contrive to separate us, dearly though we love one another.</quote>
   <p>To think that, was to believe in the reality of a nightmare
dream, Fritz chided her, and added:
   <p><quote>But I only wish you could get away from her &mdash; you and the
children as well &mdash; until the worst storm blows over.</quote>
   <p><quote>We both ought to get away Fritz &mdash; not permanently, but for a
respite. I, in that way, am strangely free for the first time since I
came to live here, and with the King so opposed to you and your views,
you can scarcely be more than a figure-head in Prussia. Moreover, the
hateful Bismarck will see that you are not.</quote>
   <p><quote>So it seems,</quote> agreed Fritz with a shrug.
   <p><quote>Why not give the King and the country time to tire of him?</quote>
Vicky urged. <quote>What good can you do, as things are? Mamma, poor
darling, has sufficiently roused herself from her grief to be
concerned for us. She has a proposition in mind, though it greatly
depends upon what she thinks of Alix when she at last meets her. If
possible she will bring about that marriage, because Papa so much
wished it, though Bertie seems more or less indifferent. Poor boy, he
has been too miserable to think about his future.</quote>
   <p>The Queen, Fritz opined, was certain to approve of the Princess
Alexandra, whose inherent gentleness would be an enormous asset to
her.
   <p><quote>Well, we shall see,</quote> Vicky said. <quote>The meeting at Laeken
has been arranged, and then Mamma has asked if we could take charge of
Bertie for a while.</quote>
   <p><quote>Take charge of him? In Berlin? He would scarcely enjoy
himself here just now.</quote>
   <p><quote>Mamma knows that. I am sure she would not advocate it.

<text id=LOBK14>
   <p>She glanced once more at the Colonel. He showed no signs of
being interested in what was going on before his eyes, and the shoe
remained, untouched, at his feet.
   <p>It occurred to her briefly (two more prisoners were examined) how
odd it was that of all the people in the convoy who had been held up
by this <squote>Colonel</squote> and his assistant, she and Benvenuto were the
only ones who knew that they could not be what they seemed. And did
Benvenuto know?
   <p>It also seemed to her that the soldier was taking a long time
reaching Benvenuto, but she did not trust her senses. It must be no
time at all, she said.
   <p>Then she heard the soldier shout: ~<squote>Fall out! ~Get back in the
trucks!</squote> and the Colonel add, in their language, ~<squote>And don't waste
any time about it!</squote> and though it seemed impossible to her that she
should have escaped, she could not think of any other possible
explanation for the command. As they started shuffling back towards
the truck she tried to keep walking evenly, in spite of the fact that
one foot was now higher than the other.
   <p>No one moved very fast. She saw Benvenuto get into the truck
among the first without looking either right or left; she saw the
soldier help one of the wounded up over the tail-gate; she saw the
Colonel start to hurry the line along, pushing each man along by the
shoulders; and when she was a few prisoners away from boarding the
truck herself, she saw the Colonel step on her shoe.
   <p>At first it seemed that he would not even notice his discomfort
in his impatience to get on to the next truck. But obviously the heel
of the shoe annoyed him and he got the soldier to point his flashlight
down at the offending object. The soldier picked it up and held it in
his hand, but the Colonel took it from him and methodically wiped the
mud from it so that its red leather shone. Clara meanwhile had passed
him and was in the truck, manoeuvring to be as close to Benvenuto as
possible. When she turned round she could see the shoe in the
Colonel's hand. It looked very small and the Colonel's hand looked
very large.
   <p><squote>What a pretty shoe,</squote> Lescaut said. <squote>What a very pretty
shoe.</squote>
<head>THREE</head>
<head>Liberation</head>
<head>1</head>
   <p>UNTIL the very moment when she was captured Clara had
believed in her heart of hearts that she and Benvenuto would escape.
She did not know how, but she was convinced that it would be so. In
those few hours from noon to midnight of that August day that had been
so filled with the Unusual, she had never ceased to believe in the
Usual, in the day-to-day life she had enjoyed for many years. Today
she was with Benvenuto; tomorrow she would be with Benvenuto. Had it
not always been so? Would it not always be so?
   <p>The more you love, the more you think it likely that the world
must love too. It takes stubborn facts to dislodge belief or habit.
Until the moment, then, that Manon Lescaut picked up the shoe, Clara
was convinced against all appearances that she and Benvenuto must be
saved: because they loved each other, if for no other reason.
   <p>Another thing she had taken for granted was that Benvenuto also
had faith in their escape, for if he hadn't why had he undertaken to
fly with her? In fact, Clara had believed that it was she who
tended to be more realistic in appraising their chances, and Benvenuto
who had been swayed by the o'erweaning optimism of his nature.
   <p>But when their capture was certain, she saw that Benvenuto had
never believed that they would escape. He made this perfectly plain
by his reactions.
   <p>Far from being more frightened than before, his capture plainly
relieved his mind of whatever doubts he may have had. He followed and
obeyed Manon Lescaut as though he was absolutely certain that the
Rumanian knew what he was doing, why he was doing it; and even as
though he thought that the Rumanian probably knew better than he,
Benvenuto, did, what was good and suitable for him.
   <p>Clara was used to following his lead, and within minutes she,
too, began to feel a certain relief that she had been captured. The
moment she realized that she and Benvenuto would not escape, she saw
that everything that had happened in the past twelve hours had
happened just as it had been ordained; and in the same way everything
that would happen to them now would happen as it was ordained. And if
this was so, there was no need to plan anything or to feel any fear.
   <p>Several times, during the hour that followed their capture, when
they were being driven through the back roads in the mountains in a
jeep the Rumanian had commandeered, she looked to Benvenuto to see if
he thought the same way; and whenever she looked, she saw her own
feelings confirmed. Benvenuto's face was deprived of all expression.
It had done away both with its past and with its future; it neither
regretted nor expected. From time to time his large and strong hand
passed under her blanket to meet hers and lie there on her lap; and
even in this he showed neither pleasure nor pain. His hand merely
indicated that he was there next to her and that they were together.
She derived a great strength from this and she and Benvenuto were
able to sustain everything the Rumanian said and did in silence.
   <p>The Rumanian was not cruel, except with his words, and his words
all seemed to deal with someone called the Capit&aacute;n and with times
that had gone by and had no particular relevance at the moment.
Indeed, she could not imagine why he bothered to mention half the
things he mentioned: did he think Benvenuto had forgotten them? or
would deny them? But now that all those things were done, now that
they were over with, what could recalling them serve?
   <p>They were taken to a caf&eacute; in the mountains and told to sit
down on two chairs by the wall, on either side of one of those
football games which are so common, where all the players are on
handles and you make goals by twisting the handles and making the
players kick a ping-pong ball into the goal. Benvenuto sat down on
the side of the red team and she sat down on the side of the white.
   <p>The Rumanian introduced her to a man called <squote>Major Vincent</squote>
and then introduced Benvenuto. They did not get up from their chairs,
nor did the Major, whom she saw as a small, fat, pink man, seek to
shake their hands. She presumed that they were going to be handed
over into his charge, and she was surprised to find that she did not
care. Then a glance at Benvenuto told her that he too did not care.
It was unimportant in whose hands they were; all would happen as it
had been ordained.
<head>2</head>
   <p>IT WAS possible for Major Vincent to misjudge the emotions
of Benvenuto and Clara as he did because from his point of view,
knowing what he knew of their fates, there was very little in their
present appearance to indicate anything else but the most abject fear
and humiliation.
   <p>As he studied them in the fullness of his self-satisfaction,
nothing suggested that the pale, weary, shrunken, wizened old man in
his tattered rags was the same proud Capit&aacute;n who had guided the
destiny of his country for twenty years. In Bassanio's patched and
threadbare uniform Benvenuto looked like an ordinary fugitive from
justice caught in an absolutely futile disguise. Gone was the
habitual arrogance of his expression, gone the proud thrust of his
jaw, the many gestures of the hands; extinct the brilliance and fire
of his eyes. Nor was it possible to see in her an Emperor's mistress,
a pampered Pompadour, as the Major had always imagined her. She
looked &mdash; the expression caused the Major a smile &mdash; like a wife, a
sort of faithful adjunct, a mute copy of her master. She sat in a
slouch with one fine shoe on one delicate foot, in a dress spattered
and stiff with mud: to the Major her cropped hair and thin breasts,
her pale and drawn face and her sleepless-strained eyes brought to
mind nothing more than submissiveness and servility.
   <p>When the Rumanian brought them in, Major Vincent decided that
they were both in the last stages of fear and exhaustion and that he
would have no trouble with them.
   <p>Benvenuto and Clara were not the first prisoners he had taken,
nor would they be the first he would execute. Most of his other
prisoners had behaved in a certain way, and he was confident Benvenuto
and Clara would behave in the same way.
   <p>What he read as fear in their faces he ascribed to the
overwhelming depression of being taken when they thought they would
be free. He thought of Benvenuto as being in the same position as
that prisoner of the Spanish Cardinal during the Inquisition. One
night the Cardinal left the prisoner's door unlocked and through
endless dangers and mounting fear the prisoner made his way to the
very outer wall of the citadel &mdash; only to find the Cardinal waiting for
him there when he had scaled that wall. To be a few steps short of
achieving one's aims, Major Vincent thought, was as terrible a fate as
could befall a man.
   <p>Like that Cardinal, the Major had his methods with prisoners, and
he believed them to be the most modern and most efficient methods, and
relatively without cruelty. What he wanted from the Capit&aacute;n before
he killed him was to see him broken down into absolute zero; he wanted
him to deny ever having been a human being; he wanted him to unthink
every thought he had ever had. If he could succeed in this, he would
have accomplished two desirable aims. First, his own thoughts would
rule supreme and he would feel, as he had felt before, that state of
semi-exaltation in which his own ideas seemed to supersede all others
and have free play with the realities of the world. In that state
there were no cars that did not function, no stomachs with special
requirements and no imperfections of communication. Second, it would
be much easier to kill his prisoner once he had been reduced to
absolute zero. Somehow, he had found, the more afraid a man was, the
easier it was to kill him.
   <p>The Major had his methods for achieving these aims: they had
always succeeded in the past. <squote>The mind is a simple thing,</squote> he
thought. <squote>It is made to feel and understand one thing at a time, so
that you can make it swing like a pendulum. You can make doubt play
with hope, speculation with logic. Ultimately the only relief is in
not caring at all. The mind will take death with ease then, for life
is a burden and a torment and death is a liberation.</squote>
   <p>What the Major did not understand was that Benvenuto and Clara
had reached this point without him. It was the Major's odd vanity to
think that he could impose this on two human beings. In reality, they
were making it necessary for him to follow that path.
   <p>But Major Vincent also had his moments of doubt. It was
impossible, for instance, to calculate what effect the girl would have
on his plans. What ought he to do with her? Wouldn't it be
considered unnecessarily cruel to kill the girl as well? And how
could he reduce her to zero when obviously all her concerns were with
the Capit&aacute;n and she barely thought of herself at all?
   <p>For the moment he sidestepped the thought. I will decide what to
do with her later, he imagined, not thinking that Clara would have
anything to say in his decision.

<text id=LOBK15>
   <p>Yet even this did not yet trouble me very much. The thought
that, whatever my reception, I would see Honor again was, in the
frenzy of need and desire which had now come upon me, enough. I was
perhaps moreover a little the dupe of that illusion of lovers that the
beloved object must, somehow, respond, that an extremity of love
not only merits but compels some return. I expected nothing very
much, I certainly expected nothing precise, but the future was
sufficiently open, sufficiently obscure, to receive the now so fierce
onward rush of my purpose. I had to see her and that was all.
   <p>What had more occupied my mind, as the train drew near to
Cambridge, was wonderment at the nature and genesis of this love.
When had I begun, unbeknown to myself, to love Honor Klein? Was it
when I threw her to the cellar floor? Or when I saw her cut the
napkins in two with the Samurai sword? Or at some earlier time,
perhaps at that strange moment when I had seen her dusty, booted and
spurred, confront the golden potentates who were my oppressors? Or
even, most prophetically, when I had glimpsed the curving seam of her
stocking in the flaring orange lights at Hyde Park Corner? It was
hard to say, and the harder because of the peculiar nature of this
love. When I thought how peculiar it was it struck me as marvellous
that I had nevertheless such a deep certainty that it was love. I
seemed to have passed from dislike to love without experiencing any
intermediate stage. There had been no moment when I reassessed her
character, noticed new qualities, or passed less harsh judgements on
the old ones: which seemed to imply that I now loved her for the same
things for which I had previously disliked her heartily; if indeed I
had ever disliked her. None of this, on the other hand, made me doubt
that now I loved her. Yet it was in truth a monstrous love such as I
had never experienced before, a love out of such depths of self as
monsters live in. A love devoid of tenderness and humour, a love
practically devoid of personality.
   <p>It was strange too how little this passion which involved, so it
seemed, a subjection of my whole being had to do in any simple or
comprehensible sense with the flesh. It had to do with it, as my
blood at every moment told me, but so darkly. I preserved the
illusion of never having touched her. I had knocked her down but I
had never held her hand; and at the idea of holding her hand I
practically felt faint. How very different was this from my old love
for Antonia, so warm and radiant with golden human dignity, and from
my love for Georgie, so tender and sensuous and gay. Yet, too, how
flimsy these other attachments seemed by comparison. The power that
held me now was like nothing I had ever known: and the image returned
to me of the terrible figure of Love as pictured by Dante. El
m'ha percosso in terra e stammi sopra.
   <p>It occurred to me later as remarkable and somehow splendid that
one thing which I never envisaged in these early moments was that my
condition was in any way bogus or unreal. Wherever it might lead, it
was sufficiently what it seemed and had utterly to do with me: I would
not, I could not, attempt to disown it or explain it away. If it was
grotesque it was a grotesqueness which was of my own substance and to
which, beyond any area of possible explanation, I laid an absolute
claim. I had no idea what I would do when I saw Honor. It seemed
quite likely that I would simply collapse speechless at her feet.
Nothing of this mattered. I was doing what I had to do and my
actions were, with a richness, my own.
   <p>I glided, motley and all, into the great checkered picture of
King's Parade. Beyond the slim street lamps the great crested form of
King's chapel rose towards the moon, its pinnacles touched to a pallid
blue against the starry distance beyond. The moon-shadow of the
Senate House lay with a thicker obscurity across the grass until
dispelled by the lamplight. The majesty, the familiarity, of these
buildings seemed to add solemnity to my rite, as when old patriarchs
come to grace a marriage. I felt by now extremely sick again and
practically suffocated with excitement and with something which I
supposed must be desire. I turned into the street where Honor Klein
lived.
   <p>I checked the numbers and could see ahead the house which must be
hers. There was a single light on upstairs. The sight of that light
made my heart increase its pace so hideously that I had to slow down
and then to stop and hold on to a lamp-post while I tried to breathe
evenly and quietly. I wondered if I had better wait a while and
attempt, not to calm myself which was impossible, but simply to
organize my breathing so as to be sure not to swoon. I stood for a
few minutes and breathed steadily. I decided that I must wait no
longer in case Honor should take it into her head to go to bed. I
knew she could hardly be in bed at this hour, and pictured the
upstairs room as a study. Then I pictured her there sitting at a desk
surrounded by books. Then I pictured myself beside her. I advanced
to the door and leaned against the wall.
   <p>There was a single bell. I had not until that moment envisaged
the possibility that she might have lodgers. In any case there was
only one bell and I pressed it. I heard no sound within and after a
moment I pressed the bell again. Still no sound. I stepped back and
looked up at the lit curtained window. I returned to the door and
pushed it gently, but it was locked. I peered through the letter box.
The hall was in darkness and there was no sound of approaching feet.
I held the letter box open and pressed the bell again. I decided
that the bell must be out of order and I wondered what to do next. I
might either call out, or bang on the door, or throw stones at the
window. I stood meditating on these various courses for a little
while, and they all seemed insuperably difficult. I was uncertain
whether I could control my voice sufficiently to produce the right
sort of cry, and the other methods were too brusque. In any case I
did not relish a head thrust from a window, a confused encounter at a
street doorway. What I really wanted was to slink quietly into some
room and find myself at once in Honor's presence.
   <p>It then occurred to me that just this was precisely what I might
be able to manage. I noticed a little gate at the side of the house
which doubtless led into the garden. I tried it and it was open. I
passed down a narrow passageway of mossy bricks which divided the
houses and found myself in a small garden. I stepped back a little.
Above the black shape of a drooping tree the high moon revealed the
back of the house, which was in darkness. French windows of a lower
room gave on to the garden. I tiptoed back across the grass and put
my hand against the windows. Here I had to pause again to subdue a
wave of sheer panic. My breathing, even my heart-beat, must I felt
already be audible through the house like the panting of an engine. I
tried the doors, got my finger into a crack and pushed them sharply
away from me. They gave; I was not sure whether they were unlatched
anyway or whether my violent push had broken some weak fastening. I
opened them wide with both hands.
   <p>A dark room gaped before me, very faintly illuminated by the
remains of an open fire. By now I scarcely knew what I was doing. My
movements took on the quality of a dream. Things melted before me. I
crossed the room and opened a door whose white surface I saw
glimmering in the darkness. I came out into the hall. A little light
from the street lamp in front, coming through the open door of one of
the front rooms, showed me the stairs. I began to mount the stairs,
leaning hard on the banisters and stepping softly. Once on the upper
landing I could see the line of light under the door of Honor's room.
I hesitated only a moment.
   <p>I advanced to the door and knocked. After so much breathless
silence the sound of the knock seemed thunderous. I let it die away
and then as there was no reply to it I opened the door. For a moment
the light dazzled me.
   <p>I saw opposite to me a large double divan bed. The room was
brightly lit. Sitting up in this bed and staring straight at me was
Honor. She was sitting sideways with the sheet over her legs.
Upwards she was as tawny and as naked as a ship's figurehead. I took
in her pointed breasts, her black shaggy head of hair, her face stiff
and expressionless as carved wood. She was not alone. Beside the bed
a naked man was hastily engaged in pulling on a dressing-gown. It was
immediately and indubitably apparent that I had interrupted a scene of
lovers. The man was Palmer.
   <p>I closed the door and walked back down the stairs.
<head>Twenty</head>
   <p>I TURNED a light on in the hall, finding the switch
instinctively, and went back into the room through which I had come.
I turned the switch here and various lamps came on. I vaguely took
in a white book-lined room with chintz armchairs. I went over and
closed the french windows which were hanging ajar. It appeared that I
had broken the fastening after all. I pulled the curtains which were
also chintz. I turned back towards the fireplace. On a low table
before it stood a tray with two glasses, a decanter of whisky, and a
jug of water. I poured out some whisky, spilling a good deal of it on
the table. I drank it. I poured out some more, poked up the fire a
bit, and waited.
   <p>Ever since the moment near Waterloo Bridge when I had come to
consciousness of my condition, I had felt like a man running towards a
curtain. Now that I had so suddenly and with such exceedingly
unexpected results passed through it I felt dazed and in great pain
but also curiously steady. I had entered the house like a thief. I
stood in it now like a conquering general. They would come, they
would have to come, to attend upon me.
   <p>I felt this steadiness, this setting as it were of my feet
sturdily apart; yet with it I was in a confusion amounting to agony.
I had so rapaciously desired and so obtusely expected to find Honor
alone. The simple fact of her not being alone was a wrench almost
separately felt, even apart from the nightmarish significance of who
her companion was. From this there shivered through me a violence
of amazement not distinguishable from horror; and I felt as a physical
pain the shock of what I had done to them. How nai"vely had I
imagined that Honor must be free; I had even, it now occurred to me,
imagined that she must be a virgin: that I would be the first person
to discover her, that I would be her conqueror and her awakener.
Caught in the coils of such stupidity I could not yet even begin to
touch with my imagination the notion that she should have had her
brother as a lover.

There is not much you can do with a mahogany wardrobe except put
your clothes in it. Save perhaps to the simple-minded, a
dressing-table and a gas-fire do not open up endless vistas of
amusement. I saw at a glance that the only possibility of diversion
lay in the bed itself, which stood in the middle of the room, hostile
and unruffled, as though convinced I would never have the courage to
use it.
   <p>But then a thought struck me: the very fact that the room was so
uncompromisingly adjusted to lying down might make this easier to do
when the right moment came. But when was it coming? How would one
recognise it?
   <p>By dismissing the porter with a florin, I brought that moment a
step nearer.
   <p>For the time being, however, it seemed essential to distract
Priscilla's attention from such matters, though I can't think why. I
knew that she was not averse in principle to the loss of that
closely-guarded ladylike secret which has inspired respect in so many
poets, especially those of the old-fashioned type. I speak of her
virginity. Though not a poet, I had respected it myself. But that
does not mean that we weren't both quite anxious to have it out of the
way. It had been playing the part of a fifth parent for far too long,
getting between us whenever we began to slip from sofa to hearthrug,
raising a finger if we reached the feverish point of asking a favour
from it. The time had arrived to get rid of it. Just as our parents
had faded into slightly ridiculous memories gesturing in the
background, so too must virginity give way before the pressures of a
legal marriage.
   <p>But Priscilla, who can be very matter-of-fact at times, was
plainly waiting for me to propose some suitable way of spending the
evening. Why should an item like marriage affect one's orderly mode
of existence? And she was right. A prompt seduction on my part would
land us with the necessity to rise, bathe and dress, chat falsely
about this and that, and emerge into the rest of the evening as though
nothing had happened. As it was, we had a ready-made climax to look
forward to, and it was merely a question of shaping the hours ahead
with tact and artistry. So I suggested we dine.
   <p>But Priscilla wasn't hungry. She had eaten too much of the
smoked salmon at the reception.
   <p>I proposed we visit a few of the places we had known together,
have a few drinks, perhaps dance.
   <p>Dancing, she claimed, would exhaust her utterly. Did I want
that?
   <p>No, I didn't.
   <p>And as for the drinks, she had no wish to be left tossing
restlessly, while I snored my way into a hangover. Did I snore by the
way?
   <p>No, I didn't. But I realised my invention was beginning to
slacken. Now that the tensions of courtship were over, was Priscilla
always going to be so difficult to entertain?
   <p>I next wondered if she would like to bear down on Shaftesbury
Avenue and see a play. Priscilla fingered the knob on the bed and
looked shocked. She thought there was something immoral about going
to the theatre on what was, after all, the only wedding night she was
likely to have for some time.
   <p>It was my turn to look shocked. When, did she suppose, would the
subsequent one take place? If that was her wish, I was prepared to
retire at once and leave the way clear for my successor. No doubt he
was already skulking in the precincts. Priscilla laughed a little.
   <p>At this point I must put down, within inverted commas, the words
Priscilla next chose to use. Luckily I am not introducing her by one
of her more stupid remarks.
   <p><squote>How long will it take you to realise,</squote> she said, <squote>that the
only thing I want to do this evening is what you keep on trying to put
off in such a nasty way?</squote>
   <p>I could have no doubt of what she meant. If we had not been
married, this would have qualified as an indecent proposal. I
experienced a pang of regret that it was Priscilla and not I who had
given voice to the thought. But the regret was quickly overwhelmed by
the stunning knowledge that this, suddenly, was just the right room,
just the right hour, for what we had in mind. The curtains shivered
at the window in a slight breeze. The evening sunlight glowed like
skin on the stuccoed houses opposite. The room was already darkening,
and Priscilla was standing by the bed, one half of her face in shadow,
the other gold with a faint reflection of the sun. A gleam caught the
edge of her lip, the corner of her eye. I could not believe I had
married this quiet breathing creature.
   <p><squote>Well,</squote> I said slowly, <squote>all right.</squote>
   <p>I thought afterwards it was an inadequate reply, but I had no
time now to see it for what it was. Nor, evidently, had Priscilla.
She heaved an enormous sigh, and I thought I saw a tear glimmering
over her eyelash. Her mouth opened slightly to my kiss and moved
beneath it. And that kiss grew with a leap into a mammoth sensation
of the sort our former love-making had always been obliged to
restrain. My hand swam through her hair and pushed her face into the
kiss. Her eyelids dropped under the weight of it, her arms came up
under my shoulders and closed over them, and a low aching cry rose in
her throat. I had never heard anything like it.
   <p>The kiss broke, as kisses do. But this was really the first
ever, because it was no longer an end in itself. We no longer had to
return to embarrassed reality, smooth down our clothes, wipe off
smudged lipstick and suggest putting on another record. It was safe
to dance on the edge of the precipice. We were licensed to jump.
   <p>I have forgotten no detail of the scene that followed: Priscilla
behaved unforgettably. With the assurance of that kiss still between
us, she drew the curtains so that the fading day was narrowed to a
slot of deep amber light, then stood on the opposite side of the bed,
her eyes stark and unpretending and fixed on mine, and began
unbuttoning her blouse.
   <p><squote>I am beginning to take off my clothes,</squote> she said distinctly.
<squote>You are not yet used to this sort of thing.</squote>
   <p>I watched her with care. She might have been giving a cool
demonstration to a class of novitiates. Her movements were precise,
practised and unemotional. I fumbled hopelessly with my tie in a
blurred imitation of her neat and methodical unclothing. She slipped
out of her blouse, unzipped and dropped her skirt, and stepped out of
it as though alighting from a bus. School had taught me that this was
the sort of thing men were normally privileged to watch only through
keyholes. But here I was, my senses involved to the point of
suffocation in the rustling magic of a woman's undressing, and the
fact that impressed me most was the purity of it: the simplicity of
soft white materials, almost as insubstantial as light, which covered
the sweet body in its own shape and slipped off it as quietly as a
shadow covering the sun and left the dark skin beneath. With hair
flopping over her shoulders, Priscilla squatted like an animal and,
thrusting out first one leg and then the other, ran her stockings
smoothly down and pulled them over her ankles. With every garment she
removed, her body appeared to pass more duskily into the shadows until
she stood in the nude, almost negligent in her attitude, not moving
any more, as natural as a tree that has shed its leaves, as casual as
a secretary waiting to take a letter.
   <p><squote>That's what it's like,</squote> said Priscilla. <squote>You'd better get
rid of any other ideas you might have had.</squote>
   <p>Then like a child she climbed clumsily into bed and sat up
shivering with the blankets round her shoulders. I put the coins from
my pocket on the mantelshelf.
   <p><squote>Do you always do that?</squote> she enquired.
   <p><squote>Yes,</squote> I said. <squote>Otherwise, you see, it pulls the pockets of
one's trousers out of shape.</squote>
   <p><squote>I do see that,</squote> said Priscilla.
   <p>She seemed interested, so I explained a few more masculine habits
which she might not have encountered. I informed her about braces: to
save trouble in the morning, one should remove them from one's suit
the night before and lay them out ready to be buttoned to another pair
of trousers for the new day. As my reason for rejecting suspenders, I
said that I had been told by doctors that they were apt to bring up
varicose veins on the legs. Priscilla uttered a groan.
   <p><squote>Let me see your legs,</squote> she said.
   <p>I showed her one. She pronounced it satisfactory. Then I
noticed that she was not looking at my leg at all. I climbed hastily
into bed.
   <p><squote>But I like it,</squote> she said.
<head>5</head>
   <p>PERHAPS we had read too few books. I once knew a man who
took a pride in practising on unsuspecting ladies the advice put
forward by authors of handbooks in respect of trial blandishments,
eccentric positions and so forth. If he did not care for the result,
he addressed witty letters of criticism to the publishers. He was a
wise fellow, and I had been wrong to question his morals. Perhaps, on
the other hand, we had expected too much from an activity which is,
after all, no more than a convenient method devised by nature for
reproducing the species. Anyway, whatever lay behind it, it was all a
ghastly flop.
   <p>To begin with, as we lay side by side like effigies, Priscilla
seemed to have put the whole business out of her mind. She suddenly
began to talk about bicycles, of all ridiculous things.
   <p><squote>When I was a girl,</squote> she said chattily, <squote>I used to ride a
bicycle.</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh, really?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes, and I was quite a horsewoman in my way too.</squote>
   <p>We had always been very much involved in the present during the
old days before the wedding, so this was something I had never
suspected about Priscilla. It was quite interesting. On the other
hand, I could have wished for a more suitable moment to digest such
confidences. My sense of fitness began to tussle with my natural
inclination to listen sympathetically to anything Priscilla cared to
say.
   <p><squote>So it wouldn't be what you might think,</squote> said Priscilla.
   <p><squote>Life never is,</squote> I suggested, in a philosophical tone.
   <p><squote>It would probably be just the strain of gymkhana jumping and
cycling madly all over the place. It can happen.
   <p><squote>Are you thinking of taking up riding again?</squote> I asked.
   <p><squote>No,</squote> said Priscilla.
   <p>I did not reply. There was a decent interval of silence. Then,
rather in a rush, activity took place.
   <p>I hardly like to describe it.
   <p>The bed creaked protestingly. I had visions, not of love, but of
waiters dashing into the room with scandalised expressions. My mind
wandered. The sweat broke out all over us, so that in a trice we were
struggling through sticky intolerable tropics of our own making. My
hair itched and I couldn't scratch it. I ricked my back. Our bodies
jumped nervously away at the slightest touch. Wriggling like an eel,
Priscilla complained of being tickled and her hand, raised in
hysterical defence, caught me painfully in the eye. I pictured a free
fight such as one sees in films and thought how much more manly it was
than this display of total incompetence. Indeed I felt, when for a
moment we paused and sank back on the damp pillows, that a fortnight
of debauchery could scarcely leave me more drained and feeble.
   <p>I had put such agonising effort into the achievement of nothing.
I could feel the veins bulging in my head and my heart beating in
angry frustration.

<text id=LOBK17>
   <p>In the bedrooms the children were preparing to sleep. In
turmoil and excitement probably, because of the strangeness, and being
packed together. What was Thomas doing? He liked to watch them; he
wanted children now; he might be undressing Bobbie.
   <p>And Aunt Mary? She would be alone, as always. She would be
plaiting the iron hair in two stiff little pigtails, and when that was
done she would sit on the edge of the wide, lonely bed she had claimed
for herself, and she would rub her legs, and sigh, and she would pull
over her head the voluminous wincey nightgown with the tucks on the
bodice and the round collar up under her chin. And when at last she
lay down she would rise out of the bed in rigid humps, like a
mountain. She would not lie relaxed and peaceful, as though she were
resting, but iron hard, as though she were still fighting.
   <p>Kate and Thomas came back along the hall, at ease and smiling.
Children on the point of going to bed, freshly washed, are at their
most lovable.
   <p><quote>Hullo,</quote> said Thomas. <quote>It's quiet. Where are the others?</quote>
   <p><quote>Sheila and Hugh are fixing the boat,</quote> said Esther. <quote>Do you
think they can manage?</quote>
   <p><quote>What was wrong?</quote>
   <p><quote>What was wrong?</quote> said Henry. <quote>What do you think was wrong?
Bash, bash on the weatherboards all day! I'm tired of it! I told
him to fix it or take it away!</quote>
   <p><quote>And I told you it was to stay there! Even if it did bang!
What can the boy do about it?</quote>
   <p>Thomas slammed up the window. He climbed out on the verandah
roof, calling <quote>Hugh!</quote>
   <p>The wind washed in a great gob through the house, sending the
curtains up to the ceiling.
   <p>In a few minutes Thomas came back, grasped the sill, and looked
in.
   <p><quote>Where are they? Goddammit, where are they?</quote>
   <p>Nobody answered. Then, ~<quote>What do you mean?</quote> said Kate.
   <p>Thomas climbed in the window, catching his foot on the sill and
tumbling to the floor. He picked himself up in a frenzy, ran into the
blue bedroom, almost knocking Teresa down, hurled up the window there.
The stern mooring line of the little boat hung straight down into the
water. Of the boat there was no sign.
   <p>Thomas rapidly hauled on the line. The end came up. It had been
cast off into the water.
   <p>Thomas ran back to the landing, hung out the window there. The
mast and sail, which he had laid in the guttering were gone.
   <p>He closed the window, turned to the old man, and said in a choked
voice, <quote>I could kill you!</quote>
   <p>For a while it was Teresa they must cope with. She was
completely frantic. She would have attacked her father but that they
pulled her away, and Kate took her into the only free bedroom, where
for a long time she tried to calm her. Julie dragged off shoes and
stockings and searched in the kitchen for aspirin, because there was
none in the bathroom. The water in which she waded was cold, thick
and repulsive, and she shuddered all the time, but it was not only
with distaste of the water and the smell of it which was now
permeating the house. The clammy flood reached to her thighs, and she
could not keep her clothes dry. She had tucked her skirt up, but it
trailed in the water. Dusk was now thickening in the corners, and
outside the water slapped, not below, as when one was upstairs, but
round about, butting about one's ears, pummelling, menacing, with all
too little to keep it out, keep it from engulfing one.
   <p>She found the aspirin at last, and climbed the stairs, to where
Thomas was waiting. He would not leave the old man. He would not let
him out of his sight again until they were all safe. He had wanted to
rush out, to swim to the boundary fence, at least, to see if he could
see them, but there was no sense in it. There was no doubt where they
had gone, downstream, to Sheila's home, which, as Henry pointed out,
aggrieved, wasn't far. There was no reason, he said, why they
shouldn't be perfectly all right.
   <p><quote>But not sailing,</quote> Thomas had said.
   <p><quote>They wouldn't need to sail,</quote> said Henry. <quote>Just drift
there.</quote>
   <p><quote>They have only one oar!</quote>
   <p><quote>They can use it to steer with.</quote>
   <p>All of which was true, and no doubt Sheila and Hugh would be
perfectly safe. Unless they tried to come back. Which they would be
anxious to do, knowing their absence would cause alarm. At the
thought of it Thomas grew cold. Sheila probably knew nothing of
sailing, and Hugh thought he knew it all. There was one comfort, if
Bob Higgins were at home he would stop any such foolhardiness. But
was he at home? That was what Sheila had gone to find out.
   <p>Thomas took the aspirin and gave it to Esther.
   <p><quote>Julie, you're wet. You must change.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll find something. Thomas, its growing dark. Hadn't I
better bring up a primus and some tea?</quote>
   <p><quote>I should fetch them myself.</quote>
   <p><quote>I can manage.</quote>
   <p><quote>Bring some things on a tray. Then you must change.</quote>
   <p>Julie went down again. The shadows were growing deeper, the
water sounded louder, both what was outside and what she was pushing
through. It made such a weight against her thighs, and the cold edge
of it was a knife on her body. Was it as high before, or do I imagine
it? She began to shudder again. Don't be silly. Think what you
need.
   <p>The big tray was on the kitchen table. The primus, too, that
Aunt Mary had used. She shook it. It seemed full. But don't forget
the methylated spirit. Cups. A few will do. We can wash them in the
bathroom. The tea caddy. The biscuit barrel. Both of willow pattern
and as old and familiar as the milk jug, which would be in the
refrigerator.
   <p>She could not open the refrigerator door. The weight of water
against its lower part was too much. Bother, I don't like tea without
milk. But I'd better leave it. To open the door would spoil some
food anyway.
   <p>Thomas has matches. The lamps are upstairs. And the candles. I
don't know what else. Sugar, yes. Bread. And butter. A few knives.
We shan't starve overnight anyway. But can I carry it all?
   <p>It's a good thing we have rainwater tanks. We do have something
to drink. Oh! Kettle and teapot.
   <p>It's awfully hard to walk in the water. Am I tired? It wasn't
so hard before.
   <p>She was lifting the tray before she noticed water washing across
the table. Now fear caught her. The flood was reaching towards her
waist, was covering the kitchen table. Water dripped from the tray as
she lifted it high. Her heart hammering, she began to wade from the
kitchen.
   <p><quote>Thomas,</quote> she said, as he came down to meet her, and took the
heavy tray, <quote>Thomas, the water is deeper. It's nearly up to my
waist.</quote>
   <p>He looked at her, nodded.
   <p><quote>Don't go down again, Julie. For anything.</quote>
   <p><quote>Thomas, I didn't feel another wave.</quote>
   <p><quote>No. But it's risen quickly, all the same. Now go and change.
I'll watch the water. Don't worry.</quote>
   <p>Julie padded off to find some clothes, wondering, in spite of all
the worry and fear and the tiredness which was beginning to clog her,
whether she at all resembled Aunt Mary doing the same thing. Esther
gave her a frock and a warm dressing gown, and she changed in the
bathroom. When she came back Sophie and Esther were sitting
dejectedly, Henry was dozing, and Thomas peering into the dusk. But
of course he could see nothing.
   <p><quote>Are the children asleep, Sophie?</quote>
   <p><quote>More or less. I've threatened them with everything. They're
settling down.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, darling, don't cry.</quote> For Esther had pulled out her
handkerchief.
   <p><quote>Cheer up,</quote> said Sophie. <quote>But all the same, why didn't I
find me a husband at home in Wellington?</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't you use your handkerchief.</quote> Julie tried to joke a
little, and then Kate came back, looking as though she too were ready
to give way. It would be better if the children were here, thought
Thomas. They would pull themselves together.
   <p>He came from the window and lit one of the lamps. The soft
yellow light flickered, then settled, pooling so that the corners of
the landing were still shadowed and remote, and peopled, suddenly, to
Julie, by the ghosts now awakened. First Grandmother, of course,
erect and certain, not fighting like Aunt Mary, but just &mdash; completely
sure of herself. From the tip of her feathered toque to the heels of
her speckless shoes she was groomed, polished, perfect and
unapproachable. And Uncle John who was killed in Flanders, and who
had become a legend and a symbol, someone for Grandmother to pin her
prayers on, so that one never knew exactly what kind of person he was,
and never would. His two brothers who had been a disappointment, and
so were never mentioned, skeletons in the family cupboard. But they
were there now, inhabiting the shadowy, shifting corners of the
landing. Did Esther notice them?
   <p><quote>How is Teresa?</quote> asked Thomas.
   <p><quote>She's lying quietly now,</quote> said Kate. <quote>I think she's all
right.</quote>
   <p><quote>Poor girl,</quote> said Esther.
   <p><quote>Hugh and Sheila are quite safe.</quote> Thomas spoke angrily, as
though trying to convince himself.
   <p>Esther wept again. Kate bent over her and said <quote>Weep now if
you must, Mother, but I ask you, please don't weep for him when
he's dead.</quote> She gestured towards her father. <quote>If you do, I'll
remind you.</quote>
   <p>Sophie looked uneasy, and Esther startled. Then she said calmly
<quote>I'll probably die first.</quote>
   <p><quote>No!</quote> said Kate. Quite suddenly she crumpled into a heap on
the floor, laid her head against her mother's knee and cried as though
she would never stop.
   <p>They were all utterly confounded. Then they became embarrassed,
as though this were something not meant for them to see. Only Esther,
after hesitating a moment, knew what to do. As though indeed Kate
were a child at her knee, Rose or Jane or Sally, she placed her hand
on Kate's hair. She did not say anything, but the gesture was all
that was needed, both to reassure Kate and to increase the feeling, in
Julie and Sophie and Thomas, that they were intruding. They were all
quite quiet and still. Only Henry's head nodded, his eyes were
closed, and his breathing loud and heavy, too loud in the quiet house,
where it was almost dark, and they did not know what the night hours
would bring.
   <p>In Julie the peaks of this day could rouse no more emotion. She
was, she felt, wrung dry and flaccid, like a cleaning cloth. The
sight of Kate at her mother's knee, where not so long ago she herself
had ached to be, should have pierced her to the quick, and in truth
she found tears wetting her cheeks, but by now she was so exhausted
that she felt no jealousy and none of the hate she had resolved to
bear for her sister. Nor pity either. She was worn out, and felt
quite detached, and wished Kate had not broken down in front of them.
   <p>Should I not feel for anyone? she wondered. Is that the only way
to live, the only way to avoid hurt, and make life bearable?
   <p>But she knew that was not the answer. And she thought, perhaps
Mother is stronger than I realised. When she is needed she is there.
Perhaps it is my fault I never sat at her knee.
   <p>I cannot lick the tears away. There are too many. Yet if I
bring out my handkerchief Thomas will notice. And I'm not crying,
really. I feel quite calm and cold. But so tired. So deadly tired.
   <p>Sophie rose at last, and went to the table. She tried
ineffectually to light the primus, and Thomas came to help her.

<text id=LOBK18>
   <p><quote>No, you're a humanist &mdash; so am I &mdash; I think. Words don't seem to
count where real feeling is concerned.</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll only be able to judge of what's happened by the way it
turns out. And you must wait for that.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm so miserable &mdash; waiting ...</quote> she confessed with trembling
lips.
   <p>He swore roundly into his beard. <quote>Listen Nan, our personal
desires can go haywire at times. If we all followed our desire what
kind of a world would we live in? Crime, disease, misery &mdash; no end to
it. There has to be law and order &mdash; and basically we make our own.
Try not to worry so much. Would you like me to have a word with
Stuart?</quote>
   <p>She started up wildly. <quote>No. No. No. Keep out if this,
Doc. You promised ... I'll never forgive you if you speak of it to
anyone ...</quote>
   <p><quote>You can trust me. I wouldn't care to tackle a man on such an
issue. It would be interesting to hear what he is thinking right
now.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, he'll be congratulating himself on a lucky escape,</quote> she
said bitterly. In spite of or because of the confession Nan was
feeling better. Doctor Benson had almost forced it from her, and she
knew that he was right, in spite of wilful desire to hug her
unhappiness to her bosom. His reasoning had given her another train
of thought.
   <p>He went to the cupboard where he mixed them both a drink.
   <p><quote>Drink this, Nan &mdash; and chin up. What can't be cured must be
endured. You'll survive.</quote>
   <p><quote>A more unfeeling remark would be hard to find. Ugh! Whisky.
I hate the stuff. I don't know how you can drink it, Doc.</quote> She
drained the glass however, and handed it back to him, before
uncrossing her legs and going to him.
   <p><quote>Thank you for everything. I think I get the general
impression. I'm still miserable though.</quote>
   <p>They exchanged smiles. <quote>It'll stop &mdash; in time. And if it
doesn't you'll learn to live with it.</quote>
   <p>He sat down by the open window, while Nan went upstairs. She
thought of his words. He knew their truth as few could do. She
remembered the war, when he had his hand on the door of his home when
the bomb fell, taking with it all he held dear. His wife, his child,
and the child to be born &mdash; and he hadn't sought solace elsewhere.
He'd learned to live with pain.
   <p><quote>I'd say he was happy &mdash; most of the time,</quote> she mused.
   <p>Was that because, having made his choice &mdash; he stayed with it, as
he had advised her to do?
<head>Chapter Nine</head>
   <p>NAN WOKE AT dawn prompted by a memory that eluded her at
first. She got up and dressed, and stood by her window, gazing out
across the garden to the road, and beyond that the beach. In the
early light the sands appeared lifeless, ugly, dark. The birds had
started their dawn chorus and it may have been this that had wakened
her.
   <p>Her gaze swivelled towards the yacht, standing far out to sea
like a graceful gull riding the waves. Near at hand was Jimmy's small
rowing boat to which he had recently attached an outboard motor. She
could hear the chugging distinctly in the quietness.
   <p>Two men were aboard ... Stuart and Jimmy. She watched them for
some time, seeing their absorbing interest in what they were doing.
Lobster would figure prominently on the menu at the yacht today. Yet
Stuart was after more than lobster fishing, Nan knew. He was too big
a man to waste time on anyone without sufficient reason.
   <p>Doc had only judged from what she had told him, yet the other
side the story went so much deeper. There could be no sharp division
as one believed when one was young. Nan saw that now. The judging
must come from one's own experience, one's own conscience, and
understanding. What the world thought didn't matter.
   <p>She saw one of the clumsy-looking lobster pots being hauled on
board and its contents taken out. This was repeated several times and
she tired of watching. She would have given much to know the
conversation between the two men as they worked.
   <p>All day she worked, keeping thought at bay, trying to win back to
tranquility. The old house shone with the extra polishing for which
she found time. Mrs. B. was washing, hanging out the clothes on
the line in the back garden, revelling in the soft breeze that had
sprung up. Nan worked herself to a standstill. When night came she
was thankful to relax. Charles and Doctor Benson were both absent
from the house for it was always a busy time for them when so many
visitors flocked to the village. Their surgeries were packed, making
their calls later and later in the day.
   <p>Jimmy brought two lobsters, dressed ready for the table. Nan
laughed when she saw them.
   <p><quote>I saw you out on the water at dawn,</quote> she told him.
   <p><quote>Yes, Mr. Maxwell was keen. He's done deep sea fishing in
Bermuda, Alaska, all over the world.</quote>
   <p>So it was of that they talked? Nan waited, putting the lobster
on a dish. <quote>They are fine ones, Jimmy.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I'm taking on that job, Nan.</quote> He looked at her
expectantly.
   <p><quote>Are you?</quote> she turned away. <quote>Are you glad about it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, It's a step in the right direction for me. Maxwell is a
fine chap. He says he'll help me a lot if I'll stick with him. He
says it will be permanent too. He wants me right away. I'm boarding
the yacht tonight.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, no Jimmy ...</quote> She was aghast at this.
   <p><quote>Sorry?</quote> he asked teasingly.
   <p><quote>Yes. I'll miss you.</quote>
   <p>His face changed its expression. <quote>I'll miss you, Nan, but it
won't be for long. I promise that. I'll be home every chance I get.
Let's have a walk, Nan ... it's our last chance for a while.</quote>
   <p>They spent an hour together, talking nostalgically as they
wandered slowly down the coast road to the village. Nan felt hedged
in by sadness which she tried to dispel for Jimmy's sake. It was only
later that she realised that he might have misunderstood her sad mood,
taking it to himself. He would think she was sad at his going.
   <p>When they returned to the house he stopped her with a gentle
force she could not withstand. <quote>Nan &mdash; you'll wait? Promise you'll
wait. I wouldn't go if I thought otherwise. It's real with me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, Jimmy, I can't promise. I wish I could. I wish I knew.</quote>
She sighed against him. <quote>Try to forget about me. You'll meet lots
of other girls. Why has it to be me, Jimmy?</quote>
   <p><quote>There's no one to hold a candle to you, Nan.</quote> He whispered
the words for he was always shy of expressing his feelings. <quote>You're
beautiful and strong and ... the girl I want.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't be hurt, Jimmy; I can't be tied down yet.</quote>
   <p><quote>Will you give me a definite answer at Christmas?</quote>
   <p>That was what Charles had said &mdash; that it had to be yes or no with
Jimmy. He couldn't understand her hesitation. She felt his eagerness
and was sorry because the failure was within herself. She returned
his kiss because that was all she had to give.
   <p><quote>Yes, I promise I'll give you an answer then. You may be the
one to feel glad that I didn't promise. You may meet someone else.</quote>
   <p><quote>No. We've known each other too long for that.</quote>
   <p><quote>Perhaps too long, Jimmy.</quote>
   <p><quote>Think of me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. Now, you'd better go. Good night &mdash; and good-bye ...
Jimmy ...</quote>
   <p>He left her abruptly. She heard his footsteps on the road,
brisk, sure of himself, and where he was going.
   <p>She turned back to the dark house, where only the light above the
surgery door showed like a pool.
   <p>Stuart stepped into that light, making her start for she had not
known there was anyone near. He must have stayed in the shadows until
he heard Jimmy leaving. There was a moment of silence, hard to break.
Nan felt as if her breath had run out at the top of her head, leaving
her suspended, her lungs helpless.
   <p><quote>Saying good-bye to Jimmy?</quote> Stuart said.
   <p><quote>You saw for yourself,</quote> she was thankful when her voice
followed her will. <quote>Why didn't you speak sooner?</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't want to spoil your last tender moments together.</quote>
   <p>She let this pass because she hated him when he sneered.
   <p><quote>I've been waiting for over an hour, cruising around on my own
in the car, then I knew you must return sometime. Where have you
been?</quote>
   <p><quote>Surely that is my affair.</quote>
   <p><quote>Answer me.</quote>
   <p><quote>We went for a last walk together &mdash; just talking. Any reason
why we shouldn't?</quote> She went ahead of him into the house, switching
on all the lights as she went. There couldn't be too much light at
that moment and she prayed that either Doc or Charles would come soon.
   <p>Stuart followed her. <quote>Not any reason. Charles is with Hilary &mdash;
bidding her good-bye for a while. This kind of thing is
contagious.</quote>
   <p><quote>I hate it when you sneer about Charles and Hilary.</quote>
   <p><quote>I wasn't sneering. I'm just jealous as hell ...</quote>
   <p>She gave him a disbelieving look. <quote>Please &mdash; do you mind? And
while we are alone, will you tell me the real reason why you gave
Jimmy that job?</quote>
   <p><quote>To get him away from here.</quote>
   <p><quote>I thought so. It won't make any difference.</quote>
   <p><quote>I gathered you were making him wait &mdash; too ...</quote> The inference
was not lost on her and she flushed hotly.
   <p><quote>Who told you so?</quote>
   <p><quote>He did, or words to that effect.</quote>
   <p>She turned her shoulder, offended in a way she could not explain
even to herself. <quote>Hadn't you better go?</quote>
   <p><quote>I too, came to say good-bye. I told you it was catching. We
rather missed out on that yesterday.</quote>
   <p><quote>Your fault. Thank you for the flowers by the way. They are
very beautiful, but you needn't have gone to so much trouble. I was
pleased to give Brownie the goldfish on her own account.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, I didn't send the flowers for that reason.</quote>
   <p><quote>No? How is she, by the way?</quote>
   <p><quote>In robust health as usual. Mrs. Tyler is finding it a bit of
a strain looking after her on deck.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm sure. She is such an active child.</quote>
   <p><quote>So &mdash; it's good-bye, Nan. You made me angry but I'm over that
now. I hope you have forgiven me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Quite,</quote> she agreed quickly.
   <p><quote>Then we could do the job properly perhaps.</quote>
   <p>She moved across the room. <quote>No.</quote>
   <p><quote>Scared?</quote> The jibe came softly.
   <p><quote>I think I am. Her compliance closed the way to him completely.
   <p><quote>You don't trust me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Good-bye Stuart. I hope you enjoy the remainder of your
trip.</quote>
   <p>He thrust both hands in his pockets and lounged closer, a pulse
beating intermittently in his temple.
   <p><quote>I'm taking Brownie back home, then going to America. I'll be
away some time, Nan. This is something I must do.</quote>
   <p>She wondered why he was at such pains to explain his movements.
It had nothing to do with her. He could go round the world and she
would not care &mdash; much. She glanced secretly at the clock, wondering
how to get him out of the house. She felt uncomfortable as she stood
with her hands on the back of the old chair.
   <p><quote>Would you like some coffee?</quote> she offered, hoping he would not
accept.
   <p><quote>Thank you. That would be nice.</quote>
   <p><quote>I won't be long.</quote> When she reached the kitchen he was close
behind her. He watched as she measured the coffee, and she wished she
had a fund of small talk with which to keep him entertained. It was
obvious that he had come to say more than good-bye.
   <p><quote>I left something in the car,</quote> he said, and went out the back
way. While he was absent she prepared the tray with cups and saucers
and sugar.
   <p>If only he'd go ... she thought desperately. The ordeal was
more than she could bear at that moment. The peace she had gained in
Jimmy's company was fast being dispelled.

<text id=LOBK19>
Here he checked the mare's pace to a gentle amble, and round a bend
in the road they came upon a low and elegant little house, standing
back behind a red brick wall with creepers that scrambled over it by a
small, green-painted gate.
   <p>In the road outside the gate a young and pretty governess was
just setting out for a morning walk with her charges, a little boy and
a little girl. The children had hoops in their hands, and it was with
the greatest difficulty that they were restrained from bowling them
into the mare's legs.
   <p>Hudson brought the gig to a stop and raised his hat to the lady.
Then, tossing the reins to the groom, he swung himself down into the
lane beside her.
   <p><squote>Good morning, Miss Greenwood,</squote> he said, and Horatia thought
she had never heard so much feeling put into such a prosaic greeting
before.
   <p><squote>Oh!</squote> said the little governess, blushing deeply. <squote>Good
morning, Mr. Crankcroft.</squote> Then she turned to the children. <squote>You
may bowl your hoops to the corner and back,</squote> she told them brightly.
<squote>And see which can get back to me first. But no cheating, mind!
Sam, you are not to trip Sukey as you did last time... And Sukey,
you are not to bowl your hoop into Sam's deliberately...</squote>
   <p><squote>No, Miss Greenwood,</squote> they cried, and they were off, their
small legs flashing down the lane, the little boy's long white
trousers not quite as quick as his sister's frilled pantaloons in
spite of her long skirts. In their absence the little governess
turned breathlessly to Hudson.
   <p><squote>Mr. Crankcroft!</squote> she said urgently.
   <p><squote>Hudson... You know we agreed that it should be Hudson,
Sophy!</squote> His teasing voice was tender as well.
   <p><squote>Hudson then!... This is madness. I told you not to come here.
The children will talk and I shall lose my situation, and your father
will find out that you are meeting me and he will be furious with you.
I cannot be the cause of a quarrel between you and your father, and
you must not be the cause of my dismissal. We must not meet any
more.</squote>
   <p><squote>But we are going to meet, and as often as we can.</squote> Hudson's
voice was firm. <squote>Sophy... darling, dearest Sophy, I must go on
seeing you because I shall die if I don't. And you would not like me
to die, would you, from such a cause?</squote>
   <p>He was teasing again, but he was serious, too. The children had
reached the corner of the lane and were arguing hotly before starting
back again, and the little governess caught at his arm.
   <p><squote>Don't you see,</squote> she cried, <squote>a governess, even in such a
kindly household as the one I am in, has no life of her own? She must
not. Her only reason for being in the house is to look after the
children and to teach them their lessons.</squote> She glanced back at
Horatia, sitting there in the gig in her funereal garments. <squote>Better
you should forget me,</squote> she said gently, <squote>while there is time.</squote>
   <p><squote>But there isn't time,</squote> he replied. <squote>Because I have already
fallen in love with you, Sophy.</squote> He introduced Horatia to her,
stressing the fact that she was a young friend of Lady Wade. <squote>I am
afraid I have made her a catspaw this morning,</squote> he explained. <squote>But
you need have no fear of her. She is a very kindly catspaw, and I
know that if she can she will fish our chestnuts out of the fire for
us.</squote>
   <p>Horatia beamed her approval from the depths of her bonnet, and
Sophy gave her a timid little smile. But the children were coming
back, their hoops racing ahead of them, and she could only implore
Hudson to leave her before she met them. As they flung themselves
upon her she told them they had both won, and neither was an inch
before the other, and then she took them away for their walk in the
opposite direction, without another glance at her lover.
   <p>Hudson drove back to Regent's park in silence, and Horatia felt
sorry for him. A hopeless love affair was almost as bad as having
coping stones on your head.
   <p>But the March morning was sunny and blustery and the buds were
thickening in the trees. There was a freshness in the grass, too,
promising that April was in the wings waiting for the signal to take
the stage, and as they entered the park Hudson asked his companion
what she thought of his charmer.
   <p><squote>Is she not the loveliest creature you have ever seen?</squote> he
asked. He was obviously head over heels in love with his Sophy, and
Horatia was able to oblige him by agreeing with him.
   <p><squote>She is very pretty,</squote> she said. <squote>And she looks
sweet-tempered and gentle and kind. I congratulate you, Mr. Hudson.
Do you intend to marry her?</squote>
   <p><squote>I do indeed. I have never met another girl like her, you see,
and I do not suppose I shall ever meet such a one again. Therefore I
dare not let go the chance, and directly I can prevail upon her to do
so I shall make her my wife, though I have nothing to offer her except
debts. We shall have to live on bread and cheese and kisses.</squote>
   <p><squote>I have heard that it is a satisfying diet,</squote> said Horatia
demurely, and he shot a quick glance at her and grinned.
   <p><squote>I say,</squote> he said, <squote>you know what is in their minds, I
suppose? Lady Wade and my father, I mean?</squote>
   <p><squote>No.</squote> She looked blank. <squote>How could I?</squote>
   <p><squote>Why, they've got the idea that you and I ought to make a go of
it. Hadn't you twigged it?</squote>
   <p><squote>But...</squote> Horatia coloured. <squote>That is absurd. Why, your
father has met me but once in his life!</squote>
   <p><squote>That doesn't matter. He would not care if he had never met you
at all.</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh, now I understand!</squote> She was mortified. <squote>It's that
wretched money again!</squote>
   <p><squote>Quite so. That wretched money, as you say. Isn't it a
peculiar thing that half the world suffers from having no money, and
the other half from having too much? And of the half that has too
much I'd say that half of them again love money and the other half
hate it.</squote>
   <p>Horatia agreed that it was all extremely unfair. Here was
Hudson, only wanting to marry his pretty Sophy and having no money to
do so. And there was herself, only wishing to live quietly in the
country among horses, without coping stones falling on her head, and
being heiress to a fortune that everybody appeared to want, and
because they could not get at it without her, suffered her as well.
It was neither a flattering nor a gratifying prospect.
   <p><squote>Mr. Hudson,</squote> she said earnestly, <squote>I apologize. It is the
first time you have taken me out, and I promise you that it may be the
last.</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh, please don't say that!</squote> He apologized in his turn. <squote>I
was clumsy in the way I put it, but I wanted to be frank with you,
Miss Horatia, because you are such an honest sort of person that I
could not be anything else. But, indeed, if you really wish to be my
friend, you will accompany me tomorrow, and the next day and the
next.</squote>
   <p>Her mortification left her and she laughed.
   <p><squote>And all so that you shall meet your Sophy in her country
lane!</squote>
   <p><squote>You've hit it, ma'am.</squote>
   <p><squote>But you will be raising your aunt's hopes and your father's
anticipations to a cruel degree.</squote>
   <p><squote>If they are foolish enough to have such hopes and anticipations
it is scarcely my affair.</squote>
   <p>Horatia laughed again.
   <p><squote>Well, I cannot say that I approve. You must remember that I am
taking your aunt's hospitality, and, if your plans go right, on
entirely false pretences. I will come with you tomorrow, but more
than that I cannot promise.</squote>
   <p>They turned away from Oxford Street towards the British Museum,
and presently clattered over the cobbles into Bounty Street, and in
front of Number Eleven they were surprised to see a phaeton drawn up &mdash;
a very new and expensive phaeton &mdash; with a pair of fine horses in the
shafts that Horatia recognised at once.
   <p><squote>Why,</squote> she cried gladly, <squote>I believe it must be Mr. Latimer!
I'd know that cattle anywhere!</squote>
   <p>Hudson glanced at her oddly, but he said no more than a mild,
~<squote>A friend of yours, Miss Pendleton?</squote> as he pulled in his little
mare behind the vastly superior equipage in front of his aunt's door.
   <p><squote>He gave us a ride into Brighton in his carriage after the stage
had left us stranded in Lewes,</squote> she explained hastily, and did not
wait for the little groom to help her down. She put her foot on the
wheel and dropped easily to the ground, and came up the steps to
Number Eleven just as the front door opened and Mr. Latimer himself
came out, a look of deep displeasure on his handsome face.
   <p>
   <p>Horatia and her escort had been gone about half an hour when old
Lady Wade, indulging in her usual occupation of watching her
neighbours from behind her parlour curtains, observed a new phaeton
turn into the street and stop outside her own front door, and although
she did not recognize it or the horses she knew the driver at once.
   <p>She was sharp enough to know that a morning visit in such a brand
new carriage &mdash; evidently brought there to impress the sadly
inexperienced Miss Pendleton &mdash; would not be paid for the sake of
herself: an enquiry and the formal leaving of a card would have been
sufficient for her. But Mr. Latimer had given the reins to his man
and was mounting the steps of Number Eleven himself, and she had no
doubt that it was the news in the morning's paper that had sent him
after Horatia.
   <p><squote>Once they know where she is, all the fortune-hunters in London
will be after her like flies after bad meat,</squote> muttered her ladyship,
scowling darkly through the curtains at Mr. Latimer's broad back,
and was in two minds as to whether she would receive him before
telling Josiah to show him in.
   <p>If her visitor was disappointed that Horatia was not with her he
did not show it.
   <p><squote>I came to assure myself that neither your ladyship nor Miss
Pendleton were any the worse for your journey last week,</squote> he said.
   <p>She looked him up and down.
   <p><squote>I took no harm from the journey, thank you,</squote> she said
disagreeably. <squote>But I'm afraid I cannot answer for Miss Pendleton, as
she is not here.</squote>
   <p>He flushed and his eyes glinted with temper, but his voice was
controlled and courteous enough as he replied:
   <p><squote>Come now, madam, I'm not an emissary from the young lady's
uncle, that fire-eating Sussex squire. But she is young and
inexperienced in the ways of the world, and I wanted to be certain
that she is safe and in good hands. If she has left your house,
perhaps you will be kind enough to tell me where she has gone.</squote> And
without being asked, he sat himself down as if the whole day was
before him.
   <p>Her ladyship was alarmed. She did not wish him to be there when
Horatia returned; she thought quickly and she thought hard and then
she said sharply:
   <p><squote>I can relieve your mind on that score then, Mr. Latimer.
Miss Pendleton is still with me. When I said she was not here I
meant to say that she was not in the house: she went out for a drive
with my nephew in his new gig.</squote> And here she glanced out of the
window at the phaeton as if to say that he was not the only man to
have a new carriage that morning. <squote>She was looking a thought pale &mdash;
the effect of the London air, I daresay, after the country.</squote> She
gave a shrill cackle of laughter which the parrot behind her echoed
with great veracity.

<text id=LOBK20>
   <p><quote>What!</quote> he cried, like a man astonished, <quote>have you loved me
and I been so inconsiderate as to make myself unworthy of your
love?</quote>
   <p><quote>Did my eyes never tell you what I looked for in yours?</quote>
   <p><quote>I never had the boldness,</quote> he answered, <quote>to make any such
construction of your looks.</quote>
   <p><quote>Your fear was the effect of indifference,</quote> I said, <quote>still,
no more of what is past. Tell me now; can you love me?</quote>
   <p><quote>Rather ask me, Ma'm,</quote> he confessed, <quote>if all the affection of
my soul can merit your love? And whether the Earl of Leicester, whom
you design to make the happiest man on Earth, shall not carry the day
from me.</quote>
   <p><quote>The Earl of Leicester,</quote> I explained hastily, <quote>was but a
pretence to make you speak; I told you then the thoughts I truly had
of you. My trouble was not small, both in your absence and since your
return; but all is now forgotten.</quote>
   <p>He answered me with some disorder which I imagined the effect of
sudden joy. I thought it time to be no longer scrupulous, that it was
in vain to have any reserve when I had said so much.
   <p><quote>I will not let you go under any uncertainty,</quote> I proceeded,
<quote>but to convince you clearly of the truth of what I've said take this
ring, as the highest mark of my favour. Keep it as a pledge of my
love, which I charge you to preserve, and on that condition I promise
never to deny you anything you shall desire when you shew it; though
it cost me my life!</quote>
   <p>His joy at receiving the ring was in appearance extraordinary and
unparalleled, and attended with promises of as high a nature.
   <p>He left for Ireland in a few days leaving me fully persuaded his
thoughts were wholly taken up with me. But he had scarce advanced
upon the rebels than he was charged with all the crimes that brought
about his imprisonment, together with that of the Earl of Southampton.
Then it was I began to repent I had not given ear to the wholesome
advice Cecil would have given me concerning the secret conduct of the
Earl of Essex. In a word, while my thoughts were wholly employed to
make his fortune he was plotting with the Earl of Tyrone to surprise
and make me prisoner!
   <p>You know the rest: his obstinate resistance, his want of respect
for my orders, his imprisoning my ministers, his murdering my
soldiers, and his intolerable pride in all his misfortune.
   <p>So ended the Queen's confession, which having called fresh to her
mind all that had passed between her and Essex made her more troubled
than ever.
   <p>The Countess of Nottingham had listened with keen interest, for
she, as well as the Queen, had been in love with the Earl of Essex!
But newly understanding the reason for his coldness it added
infinitely to her former resentment.
   <p>She had no mind to condemn the Queen's weakness knowing herself
guilty of the like, nor was she inclined to speak in favour of a man
who had grown so much the more odious to her as she had formerly loved
him. She thought it sufficient to comfort the Queen with words that
seemed to proceed only from loyalty, when in truth her thoughts were
wholly bent for the ruin of an ungrateful lover, who, in her eyes
deserved nothing but hatred.
   <p>Though the Earl of Essex did not fall for the Countess of
Nottingham, yet another was her admirer, whose character did in a way
make her amends. It was Secretary Cecil, who, amidst his great
offices and the gravity that became them, discovered in the beauty,
ingenuity, and personal charm of the Countess of Nottingham an
attraction that made him capable of strong feelings for her. This was
heightened by their mutual hatred of Essex, Cecil having always looked
upon him as an invincible obstacle to his ambitious pretentions,
whilst the Countess had against him all the rage of an aversion that
usually succeeds rejected love.
   <p>They were glad of the imprisonment of the Earl of Essex, but the
favourable inclinations the Queen expressed alarmed them.
   <p>The Countess had no sooner taken leave of the Queen than she gave
Cecil an account of all she had learnt.
   <p>Having considered the consequences they concluded it necessary,
while their sovereign pined secretly for the prisoner, that ways
should be found, without their appearing conspicuous, to take away the
mercy which love might well inspire her with.
   <p>Cecil, for the first step, pressed the Queen to bring Essex to
trial, and caused certain news of his death to be spread throughout
England.
   <p>Essex, meantime, was busied with thoughts of more weight than
those of his life. He knew well enough the Queen loved him, also that
he had deceived her, and that she might with a great deal of justice,
not only reproach but condemn him.
   <p>The Queen had not seen him since his departure for Ireland, but
not having the power to give him up to his ill-fortune she resolved to
go to his house, where he was prisoner, to reproach him as he deserved
and endeavour if possible to find him innocent.
   <p>It was not far from Whitehall to Essex House, and the Queen so
arranged the matter that no notice was taken of the visit, having been
introduced by her confidants. Essex was very surprised at the arrival
of the Queen, and the languishing condition she was in made her weak
in his presence. All was in his favour, the victory seemed easy. He
addressed her with the utmost respect, but upon doing so she broke
down, crying bitterly for some minutes.
   <p><quote>Well, Robert,</quote> she began, after a pause, <quote>you see what I do
for you, notwithstanding all the crimes I can reproach you with. I
have come with a design to hear you, to see if you have anything to
say to justify yourself. I have loved you too well, and wish it above
all things; but I would that Heaven were pleased your justification
might be realised even by the most precious thing in my power!</quote>
   <p><quote>My greatest crime is that I thought myself too secure, Ma'm,</quote>
replied the Earl, desperately.
   <p><quote>Had you rested there!</quote> said the Queen, <quote>I should have been
too well satisfied. But to believe yourself secure, was it necessary
you should betray me? And did you have need to use violence, to make
yourself master of a fortune I was willing to share? What reason had
you to seek protection from the Kings of Scotland and Spain? Did any
interest force you to correspond with Tyrone? And was it for the
safety of my person you designed to make me your prisoner, and his?
   <p>All you have done since to my subjects, against my orders; are
these the expressions of your respect? Is it by this murder and
treason that you shew your devotion to me and the public? Or is all
we have seen and heard of you but an illusion?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, Ma'm,</quote> he said, <quote>those accusations of treason and evil
design have run me upon the desperate resistance I made. You have
been pleased to heap favours upon me, and I too proud of what I so
little deserved flattered myself with the expectation of a thousand
pleasures, which you had not forbid me to hope for. This let loose
the envy and jealousy of others against my good fortune. They abused
your Majesty with misinformation and I had the misfortune to be
assured you had ordered my arrest, although my innocence would have
persuaded me to the contrary. I confess, I was enraged to see my
enemies gloat over my downfall, being abandoned by your Majesty and on
the point of suffering, perhaps, a shameful death. I thought it
neither good for my reputation, nor your Majesty's honour, that I
should die as a criminal. This forced me to those ends they reproach
me with and the resolution I took to go out of England in hopes to
confound my accusers. But I found all ways of escape closed, and must
acknowledge that in so desperate a condition I took revenge on your
ministers. They, Ma'm, and only they, were the object of the
rebellion I am charged with. My design was that those who had so
industriously laboured to make me appear guilty should do me right in
declaring my innocence, and permit me to lay it, and my life, at your
Majesty's feet. I never doubted that your Majesty would have done me
the honour of a fair hearing. And that by a clear discovery of the
truth I should have certainly frustrated them. But their malice has
had success: to see me a prisoner, hated by my sovereign, despised by
the world, and made a sacrifice to their rage. And now, what remains,
that I receive the sentence of death pronounced by them, and see
Cobham, Cecil, Raleigh, and their fellows, share the favours you
honoured me with?</quote>
   <p><quote>Be assured I do not hate you,</quote> said the Queen, interrupting
him, <quote>but shall I believe you? Yet should I not believe? Can I give
you up to your ill fate?</quote>
   <p><quote>I shall never murmur against your Majesty's orders,</quote> replied
the Earl, <quote>but submit to them readily whatever they may be.</quote>
   <p>The Earl of Essex knew the weak side of the Queen, and easily
revived in her that love he had formerly inspired her with.
   <p><quote>No,</quote> she said, having paused a while, <quote>you shall not die.
Make use of your advantage, triumph over a heart whose inclinations
you very well know. I will believe your intentions less criminal than
they appear, but, Robert, I warn you by that love of which you have
particular experience that you give me no cause to repent of it.
Trouble not yourself for your reputation and honour I will take care
to repair it, and before two days be over I will restore you to the
highest place you ever held.</quote>
   <p>Essex, overcome with joy by the success of this meeting, affected
the Queen so much that he restored her spirits to perfect tranquility.
At parting she promised to call the Council on the following day,
and, in an ostentatious manner, declare him innocent.
   <p>As soon as it was daylight, she sent for Cecil; the Countess of
Nottingham attended her. Having told them in a few words of a great
conflict between her Justice and her Mercy, she concluded for the
latter, and ordered Cecil to summon the Council that she might declare
to them the design she had to set Essex at liberty, assuring him she
had invincible reasons for doing so. This was a mortal blow to the
ambitious Cecil and the Countess of Nottingham; they looked at one
another perplexed, as if they would have asked each others 
advice on what course was to be taken. Afterwards they spoke to the
Queen in hopes to divert her, but she was inflexible; Cecil was forced
to order an Extraordinary Meeting of the Council.
   <p>But while the Earl of Essex's enemies thought his good fortune on
the point of being reconciled to him chance laboured for them with
unexpected success.
   <p>As the Queen was going to Council word was brought that the
Countess of Rutland desired an audience. The Queen blushed as she
remembered what was past, and looking on the request as unreasonable
and unlucky she was minded to put off the Countess to another time.
But considering that she never denied any person access, and that the
Countess of Rutland was a Lady of the highest repute, she commanded
her to be admitted.
   <p>Though her face was sad, her dress and gait very careless, yet
her beauty was outstanding. Moving forward she threw herself at the
Queen's feet.
   <p><quote>Madam,</quote> she cried, <quote>I come to implore your Majesty's
goodness for the unfortunate Earl of Essex!</quote>
   <p><quote>For the Earl of Essex?</quote>

<head>JOE JOE'S NOTICE-BOARD</head>
<head>BY B. A. McPHEE</head>
   <p><quote>Un paquete de cigarillos, sen&oacute;r,</quote> said the man
with the small cloth cap, the white arms and the cheery tourist smile.
   <p><quote>You mean a packet of cigarettes,</quote> Joe Joe replied in English,
first regretting his abruptness, then on instant reflection not
regretting it but thinking that perhaps he should have been even more
curt. These tourists were trying on one's patience at times, with
their vague ill-pronounced Spanish and their standard benign smiles.
   <p>Joe Joe had once thought of putting up a notice reading ~<squote>A
LITTLE ENGLISH SPOKEN HERE.</squote> He had actually obtained the board,
and his friend Jos&eacute; Puerett&eacute; had gallantly volunteered to paint
it for him free of cost. They had set to work early one evening,
Jos&eacute; with a large tin of purple paint, which he said he'd found on
the wharf, and a strong brush borrowed from Carlo Berrano, the owner
of the only hardware shop in Pasto Del Sol. However, the word
<squote>SPOKEN</squote> had presented an unsurmountable problem. Joe Joe had
to admit that the spelling of the word was beyond him, and he knew no
one that night who could help him in any way. So the work had stopped
there; for Jos&eacute; had to get the paint back to the wharf before
morning, in case, as he said, <quote>the person who owns it wants to use
it.</quote>
   <p>In point of fact, Joe Joe was glad that the notice-board had
never been completed and that it was instead cast into the back of his
shop with the empty wine-bottles and the vegetable-bags &mdash; dust-covered
and useless. He had discussed the matter at length with Sen&oacute;r
Juarez, who had once been on the town council and who was able (so it
was said) to combine aesthetic appreciation with a fine business
brain &mdash; a rare quality in any man. It was also widely known that
Sen&oacute;r Juarez had composed a poem, and a few close friends of his
had heard this poem recited, but only after a lot of persuasion on
their part and a lot of \vinos on the part of Sen&oacute;r Juarez.
Sen&oacute;r Juarez had advised that it was unsound practice to deprive a
tourist of the pleasure of trying to speak a little Spanish. He had
been told once, he said, that some English tourists took courses in
Spanish especially for their annual holidays, and these people must be
humoured and encouraged to use this knowledge of which they were
secretly very proud. If they weren't pampered in this way they could
find no justification for a fortnight's idleness in the sun, and
indeed their main sense of purpose was destroyed &mdash; they thereby
suffered a slump in morale and concluded that Pasto Del Sol was an
ungrateful place and would determine to go to Italy for their holidays
next year.
   <p>Although Joe Joe could not understand all of what Sen&oacute;r Juarez
had said, there was no doubt that one should accept the advice of an
experienced and educated man, and especially one who had been on the
town council and had written a poem.
   <p>Life was difficult, Joe Joe reflected. Sen&oacute;r Juarez was not
afflicted with a temper such as his, nor did he run a little shop
which, during the summer, was often filled with tourist people who all
smiled at you widely in the same tourist way, and expected you to
smile widely back at them in such a manner as to indicate that you
were pleased that they had smiled at you.
   <p>Joe Joe made up his mind to see Father Brenes at the little
church on the hill about his problem. It wasn't that he liked
burdening Father Brenes with his minor worries, but the good and kind
Father had assisted him once before about the same thing, and hadn't
he said, <quote>If this occurs again, Joe Joe, then please come to see me:
I'm always ready to see one of our little flock.</quote> That was the time
his wife Maria had called him an <squote>under-grown donkey</squote> and after,
when he had restrained himself from saying anything in reply, she had
thrown a melon at him, and this when his back was turned and he was
looking out of the window for guidance.
   <p>Then he had all but lost his temper. As he said to Father Brenes
at the time, <quote>I nearly swore at her, Father. It was only by
clasping the window-sill and clenching my teeth that I saved myself
from uttering a blasphemous word.</quote>
   <p><quote>You did right, my son,</quote> Father Brenes had said. <quote>You did
right to clench your teeth and clasp the window-sill and utter not a
word. But you were wrong in even contemplating using such a word,
because the proper Christian attitude is one of patience, tolerance
and understanding, and two wrongs don't make a right.</quote>
   <p>So now he hoped that he would not feel any similar temptations,
but it would be especially difficult if Maria threw another melon at
him when his back was turned.
   <p><quote>...And two boxes of matches,</quote> the white-armed tourist
continued, the laughter having gone from his voice. Joe Joe cut a
piece of brown paper with the large wooden-handled all-purpose knife,
wrapped up the cigarettes and matches and handed them to the now
somewhat disinterested customer.
   <p><quote>\Gracias,</quote> acknowledged the white-armed one, a suggestion
of a smile returning to his lips.
   <p><quote>\Adios, \sen&oacute;r,</quote> Joe Joe said.
   <p>Maria called down the steps that descended to the shop from the
two rooms above, which formed their little home.
   <p><quote>Joe Joe,</quote> she shouted, <quote>when are you going to close the shop
and clean the fish which are making my kitchen smell like a
fish-shop?</quote>
   <p><quote>I am going to close the shop now, Maria,</quote> he answered
resignedly, <quote>and I will then clean the fish which are making your
kitchen smell like a fish-shop.</quote>
   <p>Maria was sitting in her usual position in a heavy and ornately
designed wooden chair given to her by her mother at the time of her
marriage to Joe Joe. Since then it had occupied a large area of the
small kitchen. She had an almost irritating habit of shuffling her
feet on the bare boards as she sat and sewed. She was carefully
embroidering a lace handkerchief, as she had been doing for six weeks
now.
   <p><quote>I can't smell anything,</quote> Joe Joe commented as he came up the
stairs sniffing loudly.
   <p><quote>It's all right for you,</quote> his wife replied sharply, <quote>down in
that shop all day while I'm stuck here with two uncleaned fish for
company.</quote>
   <p>Joe Joe nearly said, ~<squote>Why didn't you clean them yourself, by
Saint Christopher?</squote> but remembered Father Brenes and instead picked
up the fish and began scaling them with the all-purpose knife.
   <p>He glanced over at Maria as she sat there in her formidable
high-backed chair with her six-weeks' lace handkerchief on her knee,
and as he put one fish down and picked up another, his mind drifted
back to the night, many years ago, when he and Maria had together sat
on the little pebbly beach that adjoins the beach of Pasto Del Sol.
He and Maria had been courting then. She had stolen away from her
Mama (a significant woman) to meet him below the cliff-face at the far
end of the bay. Together they had sat throwing hard, round pebbles
into the dark waters, and there was a moon that was not a full moon
but was nevertheless the finest moon that Joe Joe had seen up until
then.
   <p>Maria had long black hair when she was young. It reached down
her back in a broad sweep. It was her pride and joy, and the pride
and joy of her Mama, and the talk of the lads at the Market Square on
Saturday nights. Her eyes were deep and dark, and her waist one of
the slimmest in the village. It was possible to wind the cane band at
the top of a lobster-pot round it with ease.
   <p>That night he had trembled. Trembled at the calm, dark waters,
the moon and the pebbly beach. Trembled when he touched her long warm
fingers and heard her soft low pebbly-beach voice. Then he had kissed
her red lips, once, clumsily but strongly. The night had been still
and silent and even the waves slumbered.
   <p>He had said to her, as they sat there mute together, ~<quote>Maria, my
lovely Maria, I want you to marry me,</quote> and she'd replied with a
spontaneity which amazed him.
   <p><quote>I will, Joe Joe, my darling little Joe Joe, but we must wait
until your father lets you have his shop for yourself and then we may
make our home in the two rooms above the little shop. It is best Joe
Joe, and Mama would think so too.</quote>
   <p>Joe Joe had been so elated and the months succeeding had been so
blissful that he had become less and less aware of Maria's four large
front teeth, which protruded from her mouth very sharply, and which
also were the talk of the lads at the Market Square on Saturday
nights.
   <p>Now the ebony black hair was discoloured with grey strands and
tied in a tight and severe bun. Her eyes were still deep and dark it
was true, and flashed, it was also true, but somehow in a different
way. Now it would be impossible to wind around her waist even the
lowest band of a lobster-pot, and the voice of the pebbly beach was no
more.
   <p>Joe Joe finished getting the fish washed and laid them neatly on
a large flat plate. He cleaned the all-purpose knife with the long
wooden handle and put it away carefully. Taking up his sombrero and
with a quick ~<quote>\Adios</quote> to Maria, who did not take her eyes from
her sewing (for strict concentration was required), he walked out of
the door with his hands deep in his pockets. It was Joe Joe's custom
to keep his hands in his pockets on the way to the Caf&eacute; Del Costa,
since he could count the coins he had there as he walked along and
thereby gauge the number of cognacs he would be able to purchase.
   <p>At the caf&eacute; he met his friend Jos&eacute; Puerett&eacute;, as he did
every evening, and the two friends shook hands warmly and sat at their
usual place at a table in the corner.
   <p><quote>Well, Joe Joe, my friend,</quote> Jos&eacute; said; <quote>the fish were not
biting today, but the water was calm and the sun was hot and my
brother and I were not greatly disappointed.</quote>
   <p>Jos&eacute; and his brother were the joint-owners of a fishing-boat
which, laden with nets, set off from the beach every morning just as
the sun peeped over the mountains at the back of Pasto Del Sol, in an
almost fruitless search for fish.
   <p>It was said (allegedly by rivals) that the Puerett&eacute; brothers,
who had not been fishermen for long, lacked the native instinct of the
others whose fathers and whose fathers before them were fishermen of
the bay, and that this accounted for their singular lack of success in
obtaining hauls. Others said that they spent too much time in siesta
and that they would pull round one of the rocky inlets to the north of
the bay and anchor there, sleeping, munching bread and drinking wine.
   <p>Joe Joe did not really believe this latter story which he
suspected was invented by Jos&eacute;'s wife, a hardworking but mean woman
with sharp cheek-bones. In fact, Jos&eacute; was a resourceful and
practical person who, one afternoon when the boat had started to fill
up with water from a large leak, had calmly awakened his brother and
then had swum ashore to enlist help, leaving his brother to tread
water so as to mark the spot where the boat had sunk. With the aid of
other boats the craft had been brought to the surface and towed
ashore, and Jos&eacute; had that night accepted many congratulationary
cognacs proffered him by those who admired his quick thinking and
coolness in a crisis.

<head>Never speak to strange men</head>
<head>BY DIANA ATHILL</head>
   <p>Conversation, as Oscar Wilde might almost have said, is the
easy art of losing friends and alienating people; if you've ever been
inescapably bound by the threads of conversation of two such gentleman
as Mr. Ball and Mr. Baring, you're likely to agree. If you
haven't, take warning and plan an escape route in advance.
   <p>
   <p>THERE are often too few chairs on steamers which visit
Adriatic islands, and those few are shackled together, to be queued
for until a morose sailor consents to unlock them. This gives them
rarity value. Uncomfortable though they are, it seems a privilege to
have one, even if you would rather be leaning on the rail. So if two
men insist on giving up their hard-won deck-chairs to two women, it
would be ungracious of the women to refuse.
   <p>That was how I and my cousin Laura met Mr. Ball and Mr.
Baring.
   <p>They came from Oldham, had been visiting a Trade Fair, and were
now on a spree, intending to spend one night in the town for which we
were bound. Mr. Ball, who boomed and had three strands of hair
trained across his skull, was about fifty-five. Mr. Baring, who
whispered and wore pince-nez, was seventy if he was a day. They
were probably the kindest men we shall ever meet and they were both
mines of information on draught-proof floor coverings and plastic
paints.
   <p>Mr. Ball was also widely travelled and had brought back from
Malaya, Peru, Queensland, and the Friendly Islands an astonishing
collection of statistics concerning measurements. He could &mdash; and
did &mdash; describe how high, wide, deep, thick and heavy was any object
you might like to name in any of those places.
   <p>Mr. Baring was less enterprising. This Trade Fair had been his
first journey abroad and his preoccupations were chiefly dietary.
   <p>By the end of the first morning Laura, who has less sense of
social obligation than I have, had sidled out of her deck chair and
was sitting on a hatch beside a medical student with a guitar. I was
still stuck, and trying to view the experiences as a salutary
discipline. I hope that Laura and I travel to see new places and
enjoy new beauties in nature and art, but it is true that when we have
encounters we like them to be worth having. The encounters I had
imagined for this journey were certainly remote from Mr. Ball and
Mr. Baring in everything but sex (if, in this context, you could
call it that), but I reminded myself of how kind they were and I told
myself that anyway it would be over when we reached our destination.
   <p>That was the first day. On the second I was beyond thought. I
was not suffering, but I had become numb in all my faculties ... a
point of boredom I had never reached before. When lunch came round
again it seemed to be by immemorial custom that I was listening, as I
ate, to an account of the exact dimensions of Mr. Ball's verandah in
Kuala Lumpur (some eighteen inches longer than his verandah in Lima),
and the weight of the largest and the smallest sweet potato he had
ever eaten.
   <p>Meanwhile, as inertia crept up on me, the venerable Mr. Baring
was becoming more lively. At first he had been slightly oppressed by
his companion's sophistication, but when the talk turned to food he
perked up to the extent of telling me which breakfast cereals his
grandchildren preferred.
   <p>The journey ended that evening. As the gang-plank went down,
Mr. Ball said to me, <quote>I suppose you have a room booked?</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> I said, without thinking. <quote>We'll get an address from
the tourist office.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're in luck!</quote> exclaimed Mr. Ball. <quote>Look what I've got.
A letter from the tourist chief in the capital to his man here,
telling him to look after us. You just stick with us and you'll be
all right.</quote>
   <p>Laura began to edge backwards against the surge towards the
gangway. I began to babble about being a nuisance &mdash; but it was too
late. The porters had been unleashed, Mr. Ball had caught one and
handed over our baggage as well as his own, and there we were on the
quay with our benevolent friends, obviously <quote>together.</quote> Other
people were borne off in large numbers towards adventure. Laura and I
(not, I suspected unhappily, on speaking terms) got meekly into a taxi
with Mr. Ball and Mr. Baring, the last traces of our initiative
vanishing as we did so.
   <p>We were visiting a small, thickly walled and lovely town with
straggling outskirts. The straggle was long and thin &mdash; the mountains
came too close for it to spread backwards &mdash; and unless you were
careful, we knew, you could find yourself staying some way from the
old town. We had hoped to find rooms within the walls, or only just
outside, and before Mr. Ball got to work on the tourist chief we
said as much.
   <p><quote>Oh no,</quote> he said, shocked. <quote>You wouldn't like that. You
wouldn't like the noise.</quote>
   <p><quote>But cars aren't allowed inside,</quote> I pointed out.
   <p><quote>It isn't cars. It's the talking and the music &mdash; they go on all
night in these places. And besides &mdash; the drains. We'll find a nice,
clean, modern place, don't you worry.</quote>
   <p>We were not worrying, we were panicking, but I was still numb and
Laura was speechless with rage. We could not think of words that
would not have been rude and wounding to this kind, kind man. So
before long Mr. Ball, Mr. Baring, Laura and I were being welcomed
to an eminently respectable, exquisitely clean, comfortable, modern
house, a good half-hour's walk (the trams did not go that way)
outside the walls. And then, before the night was out, the rains
came.
   <p>It rained and blew for five days without stopping. Since it was
August, widely advertised as the Adriatic's most benign month, we had
not stopped at bringing no raincoats and no umbrellas: we had brought
no coats and no sensible shoes either.
   <p>Had we been staying in the town itself we could each day have
darted across into the City Caf&eacute; where it was possible to live a
full life for hours on end without setting foot out of doors; we
should have had a choice of eating places within a few yards; we could
have danced every evening.
   <p>As it was, on the rare occasions when the rain diminished to a
drizzle we would hurry out in an attempt to reach the town before we
were drenched. Once or twice we did reach the town &mdash; but never before
we were drenched, and about the only amenity not provided by the City
Caf&eacute; was a drying room.
   <p>All this, as an act of God, might have been borne. The truly
testing aspect of the situation was that no aeroplane could take off
from the airfield, and Mr. Ball and Mr. Baring had planned to
return to their Fair, after only one night, by air.
   <p>The local inhabitants, anxious for their district's reputation
for clemency, had decided that the best thing to do about all this
rain was to belittle it. Yes, of course, they said every morning at
the airline office, <quote>It will stop tonight, planes will certainly be
leaving tomorrow.</quote> So our friends did not change their plans and go
by boat. No. They were immured with us in that spotless house for
five of the longest days I have ever lived through.
   <p>We expected them to be fretful at this grave hitch in their
plans, but they did not seem to mind it. Mr. Ball had known far
longer and &mdash; incredible as it seemed &mdash; duller delays on savannah and
prairie, about which he now had time to tell us in detail, while Mr.
Baring, though gently distressed at first, in the end found his
imprisonment positively rewarding. To begin with, his digestion was
upset, and this led him to the discovery of yoghourt: a discovery
which he was clearly going to recall throughout his declining years as
an important event; though perhaps not always at half-hourly
intervals, as he did at the time.
   <p>However long we stayed in bed every day, we had to get up at
last &mdash; and there they would be, cheerful and kind, ready for talk and
paper-games involving arithmetic of which, it turned out, the
resourceful Mr. Ball knew a great many. When they said charming
things to us &mdash; how grateful they were for our company, how pleased to
have found us such a nice house &mdash; we could not meet their eyes.
   <p>Mr. Baring sometimes made it worse by taking us aside and
whispering that if we wished to go out and enjoy ourselves, to escape
from two old fogeys, we must not hesitate to do so. Conscious of our
bilious rage, suppressed, we feared so badly, we were driven by guilt
(not to mention the rain) to effusive protests. Good heavens no, what
nonsense, we would say, and settle down to another paper game.
   <p>The climax of each day came at dinner time. We might have been
listening to wild music, we might have been dancing, we might have
been meeting young men with bold, flashing eyes; and instead, because
our landlady served no meals, we would splash across to the next-door
pension under umbrellas held by Mr. Ball and Mr. Baring,
there to eat Wiener schnitzel at a long table with seven
middle-aged married couples from Wuppertal.
   <p>Relief came on the sixth day. Having learned that bits of purple
storm cloud look deceptively like blue sky when seen through the
chinks in shutters, we had not bothered to consult the sky. The first
we knew of the weather's change was when Mr. Ball knocked on our
door and told us that a taxi had come to take them to the airport.
   <p><quote>Well, young ladies,</quote> he said, <quote>we have shared an interesting
experience. The rainfall in these last five days has been half as
much again as the average for the four months June to September,
inclusive.</quote>
   <p>As the taxi bumped away we collapsed on our beds and exchanged
the first look we had dared to give each other since our arrival. We
still had five more days in this legendary place.
   <p><quote>We'll move this morning,</quote> said Laura. <quote>We'll move right
into the very middle of the town and we'll find a room above a caf&eacute;
which has music, looking on to the market place.</quote>
   <p><quote>And what's more,</quote> said I, <quote>we'll hardly ever be in it. I'm
only going to stop swimming in order to eat, and stop eating in order
to talk, and stop talking in order to dance.</quote>
   <p>But as we spoke our landlady came in. She carried a tray on
which were two little glasses of cherry brandy and two big slices of
home-made sponge cake. <quote>Sun, yes?</quote> she said. <quote>I am so
'appy for you,</quote> and she beamed with pleasure. Not only was she
the mistress of a respectable, clean, modern house, but she, too,
was &mdash; oh ominous word &mdash; as kind as kind can be. How could we possibly
run out on anyone so admirable, for no definite reason?
   <p>Thus, though our holiday had begun at last, we were still under
the wing of Mr. Ball and Mr. Baring. Try as we might, no harm was
going to come to us. In the small hours of each day left to us, after
some nineteen hours of sight-seeing, swimming, talking, drinking, and
dancing, we still had to leave those bewitching noisy streets; we
still had to trudge for half an hour back to our eminently respectable
lodgings. And so respectable were they that once we had reached the
door our escorts &mdash; those, that is, who were stalwart enough still to
be with us &mdash; never dreamed of doing anything more than shake our
hands.

   <p>Here, in this country village, she had spent her childhood.
Here she had first been in love.

<text id=LOBK23>
   <p>The white people seized on the slightest word, Nature took the
lightest footfall, with fanatical seriousness. The English nurses
discovered that they could not sit next a man at dinner and be
agreeable &mdash; perhaps asking him, so as to slice up the boredom, to tell
them all the story of his life &mdash; without his taking it for a great
flirtation and turning up next day after breakfast for the love
affair; it was a place where there was never a breath of breeze except
in the season of storms and where the curtains in the windows never
moved in the breeze unless a storm was to follow.
   <p>The English nurses were often advised to put in for transfers to
another district.
   <p><squote>It's so much brighter in the north. Towns, life.
Civilisation, shops. Much cooler &mdash; you see, it's high up there in
the north. The races.</squote>
   <p><squote>You would like it in the east &mdash; those orange planters.
Everything is greener, there's a huge valley. Shooting.</squote>
   <p><squote>Why did they send you nurses to this unhealthy spot? You
should go to a healthy spot.</squote>
   <p>Some of the nurses left Fort Beit. But those of us who were
doing tropical diseases had to stay on, because our clinic, the
largest in the Colony, was also a research centre for tropical
diseases. Those of us who had to stay on used sometimes to say to
each other, <squote>Isn't it wonderful here? Heaps of servants. Cheap
drinks. Birds, beasts, flowers.</squote>
   <p>The place was not without its strange marvels. I never got used
to its travel-film colours except in the dry season when the dust made
everything real. The dust was thick in the great yard behind the
clinic where the natives squatted and stood about, shouting or
laughing &mdash; it came to the same thing &mdash; cooking and eating, while they
awaited treatment, or the results of X-rays, or the results of an
X-ray of a distant relative. They gave off a fierce smell and kicked
up the dust. The sore eyes of the babies were always beset by flies,
but the babies slept on regardless, slung on their mothers' backs, and
when they woke and cried the women suckled them.
   <p>The poor whites of Fort Beit and its area had a reception room of
their own inside the building, and here they ate the food they had
brought, and lolled about in long silences, sometimes working up to a
fight in a corner. The remainder of the society of Fort Beit did not
visit the clinic.
   <p>The remainder comprised the chemist, the clergyman, the
veterinary surgeon, the police and their families. These enjoyed a
social life of a small and remote quality, only coming into contact
with the poor white small-farmers for business purposes. They were
anxious to entertain the clinic staff who mostly spent its free time
elsewhere &mdash; miles and miles away, driving at weekends to the capital,
the north, or to one of the big dams on which it was possible to set
up for a sailor. But sometimes the nurses and medical officers would,
for a change, spend an evening in the village at the house of the
chemist, the clergyman, the vet, or at the police quarters.
   <p>Into this society came Sonia Van \der Merwe when her husband had
been three years in prison. There was a certain slur attached to his
sentence since it was generally felt he had gone too far in the heat
of the moment, this sort of thing undermining the prestige of the
Colony at Whitehall. But nobody held the incident against Sonia. The
main difficulty she had to face in her efforts towards the company of
the vet, the chemist and the clergyman was the fact that she had never
yet been in their company.
   <p>The Van \der Merwes' farm lay a few miles outside Fort Beit. It
was one of the few farms in the district, for this was an area which
had only been developed for the mines, and these had lately closed
down. The Van \der Merwes had lived the makeshift, toiling lives of
Afrikaans settlers who had trekked up from the Union. I do not think
it had ever before occurred to Sonia that her days could be spent
otherwise than in rising and washing her face at the tub outside,
baking bread, scrappily feeding her children, yelling at the natives,
and retiring at night to her feather bed with Jannie. Her only
outings had been to the Dutch Reformed gathering at Easter when the
Afrikaans came in along the main street in their covered wagons and
settled there for a week.
   <p>It was not till the lawyer came to arrange some affair between
the farm and the Land Bank that she learned she could actually handle
the fortune her father had left her, for she had imagined that only
the pound notes she kept stuffed in the stocking were of real spending
worth; her father in his time had never spent his money on visible
things, but had invested it, and Sonia thought that money paid into
the bank was a sort of tribute-money to the bank people which
patriarchal farmers like her father were obliged to pay under the
strict ethic of the Dutch Reformed Church. She now understood her
cash value, and felt fiercely against her husband for failing to
reveal it to her. She wrote a letter to him, which was a difficult
course. I saw the final draft, about which she called a conference of
nurses from the clinic. We were wicked enough to let it go, but in
fact I don't think we gave it much thought. I recall that on this
occasion we talked far into the night about her possibilities &mdash; her
tennis court, her two bathrooms, her black-and-white bedroom &mdash; all of
which were as yet only a glimmer at the end of a tunnel. In any case,
I do not think we could have succeeded in changing her mind about the
letter which subsequently enjoyed a few inches in the local press as
part of Jannie's evidence. It was as follows:

   <p>Dear Jannie there is going to be some changes I found out what
pa left is cash to spend I only got to sine my name do you think I
like to go on like this work work work counting the mealies in the
field By God like poor whites when did I get a dress you did not say a
word that is your shame and you have landed in jale with your bad
temper you shoud of amed at the legs. Mr. Little came here to bring
the papers to sine he said you get good cooking in jale the kids are
well but Hannah got a bite but I will take them away from there now
and send them to the convent and pay money. Your Loving Wife, S.
Van der Merwe

   <p>There must have been many occasions on which I lay on my bed on
summer afternoons in Worcestershire, because at that time I was
convalescent. My schooldays had come to an end. My training as a
radio-therapist was not to begin till the autumn.
   <p>I do not know how many afternoons I lay on my bed listening to a
litany of tennis noises from where my two brothers played on the court
a little to the right below my window. Sometimes, to tell me it was
time to get up, my elder brother Richard would send a tennis ball
through the open window. The net curtain would stir and part very
suddenly and somewhere in the room the ball would thud and then roll.
I always thought one day he would break the glass of the window, or
that he would land the ball on my face or break something in the room,
but he never did. Perhaps my memory exaggerates the number of these
occasions and really they only occurred once or twice.
   <p>But I am sure the curtains must have moved in the breeze as I lay
taking in the calls and the to and fro of tennis on those unconcerned
afternoons, and I suppose the sight was a pleasurable one. That a
slight movement of the curtains should be the sign of a summer breeze
seems somewhere near to truth, for to me truth has airy properties
with buoyant and lyrical effects; and when anything drastic starts up
from some light cause it only proves to me that something false has
got into the world.
   <p>I do not actually remember the curtains of my room being touched
by the summer wind although I am sure they were; whenever I try to
bring to mind this detail of the afternoon sensations it disappears,
and I have knowledge of the image only as one who has swallowed some
fruit of the Tree of Knowledge &mdash; its memory is usurped by the window
of Mrs. Van \der Merwe's house and by the curtains disturbed, in the
rainy season, by a trifling wind, unreasonably meaning a storm.
   <p>Sometimes, on those restful afternoons, I was anxious. There was
some doubt about my acceptance for training as a radio-therapist
because of my interrupted schooling. One day the letter of acceptance
came by the late post. I read the letter with relief and delight, and
at that same moment decided to turn down the offer. It was enough
that I had received it. I am given to this sort of thing, and the
reason that I am drawn to moderate and tranquil motives is that I lack
them. I decided instead to become a hospital nurse and later to
follow my brother Richard, who was then a medical student, to Africa,
and specialise, with him, in tropical diseases.
   <p>
   <p>It was about a year after my arrival at Fort Beit that I came
across Sonji Van \der Merwe and, together with the other nurses, read
the letter which was about to be sent to her husband four hundred
miles away in the Colony's prison. She posted the letter
ritualistically the next afternoon, putting on her church-going gloves
to do so. She did not expect, nor did she receive, a reply. Three
weeks later she started calling herself Sonia.
   <p>Our visits to the farm began to take the place of evenings spent
at the vet's, the chemist's and the clergyman's, to whose society
Sonia now had good hopes of access. And every time we turned up
something new had taken place. Sonia knew, or discovered as if by
bush-telegraph, where to begin. She did not yet know how to travel by
train and would have been afraid to make any excursion by herself far
from the area, but through one nurse or another she obtained
furnishings from the Union, catalogues, books about interior
decoration and fashion magazines. Travel-stained furniture vans began
to arrive at her bidding and our instigation. Her first move,
however, was to join the Church of England, abandoning the Dutch
Reformed persuasion of her forefathers; we had to hand it to her that
she had thought this up for herself.
   <p>We egged her on from week to week. We taught her how not to be
mean with her drinks, for she had ordered an exotic supply. At first
she had locked the bottles in the pantry and poured them into glasses
in the kitchen and watered them before getting the house boy to serve
them to her guests. We stopped all that. A contractor already had
the extensions to the house in hand, and the rooms were being
decorated and furnished one by one. It was I who had told her to have
two bathrooms, not merely one, installed. She took time getting used
to the indoor lavatories and we had to keep reminding her to pull the
chain. One of us brought back from the capital a book of etiquette
which was twenty-eight years old but which she read assiduously,
following the words with her forefinger. I think it was I who had
suggested the black-and-white bedroom, being a bit drunk at the time,
and now it was a wonder to see it taking shape; it was done within a
month &mdash; she had managed to obtain black wallpaper, and to put it up,
although wallpaper was a thing unheard of in the Colony and she was
warned by everyone that it would never stick to the walls.

<head>The Toothache</head>
   <p>Toothache on top of all this was too much. He had always taken
great care of his teeth, even as a child. A child. His marriage was
two months old and he wished that he was. Fifty years had passed in
as many days. That made him seventy three. Another two to go. His
life was almost over. He had come to the right place. The door was
divided, like a stable door, into two equal leaves. He knocked on the
upper leaf, a frosted glass panel with the name and profession in
heavy black capitals. The upper half opened. A clean, florid face
appeared and disappointment pricked him.
   <p> &mdash;Yes?
   <p> &mdash;Would you... attend to this for me, please?
   <p>The slip of paper was carefully scrutinised. Himself. The
paper. Himself.
   <p> &mdash;Are you the father?
   <p> &mdash;Yes.
   <p> &mdash;Come in.
   <p>The lower half of the door was unlatched to admit him into a room
which seemed half church, half office. The ecclesiastical half was
neat and shining, the official half untidy, strewn with papers.
Nameless brass projections hung on the walls and looked as if they
had been looted from a church. There were glossy photographs of the
rest chapels in the city's crematoria. The funeral director busied
himself among his littered papers, and, in a few minutes, with the air
of having solved a problem, pronounced, as if he expected his client
to haggle:
   <p> &mdash;That will be three pounds ten, young man.
   <p> &mdash;Yes.
   <p>He drew four new pound notes from his wallet, crossed the room,
and placed them emphatically beneath the undertaker's eyes.
   <p> &mdash;It will be tomorrow. Will anyone attend?
   <p> &mdash;No.
   <p> &mdash;Has it got a name?
   <p> &mdash;No.
   <p> &mdash;Shall I inform you of the place of burial?
   <p> &mdash;No... thank you.
   <p> &mdash;Some people like to know, but best forgotten. 
   <p> &mdash;If the child had lived only a few days or weeks it would have
had a name. And a stone.
   <p>He felt he was apologising for not bringing better trade.
   <p> &mdash;A different matter. But best forgotten.
   <p>He seemed to have solved a problem.
   <p> &mdash;It doesn't often happen these days.
   <p>He wondered how much a child of a few months would cost.
   <p> &mdash;Right. I'll see to it tomorrow for you.
   <p> &mdash;Thank you.
   <p>He turned to go. The business completed, the undertaker moved
from the official to the ecclesiastical side of the room, and took his
hand.
   <p> &mdash;Put it there. I know what it is. I'm a family man myself.
   <p>With his other hand the undertaker held out a small receipt for
three pounds ten and a crumpled ten shilling note. He took them and
went through the divided door.
   <p> &mdash;Good afternoon.
   <p> &mdash;Good afternoon, young man.
   <p>It had been the same with the registrar of births and deaths,
when he had collected the certificate for disposal at the hospital
that morning. Names. Dates of birth. 1937. 1937. Professions.
Schoolteacher. Schoolteacher. The registrar wrote the date of the
stillbirth. 19 February, 1960.
   <p> &mdash;When were you married?
   <p> &mdash;December the Sixteenth.
   <p> &mdash;Nineteen Fifty Eight?
   <p> &mdash;No, last year.
   <p>The registrar smiled. Who had selected him to endure this?
Time? Like an ever rolling stream. There was comfort in that. His
tooth ached. No comfort. There was time to kill before his dental
appointment. There was always time to kill. You stood in the present
and watched either the last moment die or the next being born. As
they were ejaculated into being, his mind, like a spermicide, killed
off the seeds of time. All his moments were dying. When you were
seventy three you could only look behind you. At that age you walked
backwards into the future. There was time to kill before his dental
appointment, before he died. He would walk.
   <p>To reach the dentist's, which he had not thought to change, he
had to walk from Town to Beeston, up the long hill that overlooked the
rest of Leeds. It was very near his old home. Since he had left so
abruptly he had not returned. The lack of forgiveness would remain
mutual. His resentment would consume his guilt. Supposing he was
seen? Let them see him. Supposing he saw his mother at the
greengrocer's on the corner? He would ignore her. He had written a
terse postcard to tell them about the child and that was all. They
would say it was a judgement. Besides if you were seventy three, your
parents would be dead. All the names that had been heaped on them!
All the fragments of morality that had fallen about their heads! The
fifth and the seventh commandments. They had burned his photograph
and the Bible he had kept at his bedside. Such as he had no right to
possess that, let alone read it. It had only been an ornament anyway.
A tit bit. A miniature edition, inscribed Joseph Carson, 1841.
He had picked it up in the market for a few pence, buried under the
battered copies of Marie Corelli, Ouida and Hall Caine.
   <p>
   <p>After only two months of absence the familiar streets showed
signs of considerable change. Instead of the lines of gas lamps he
was shocked to find overhead sodium lighting, and there was demolition
in progress on a row of terrace houses, almost the same as his own
street. He stopped to watch. There was time to kill. Ahead of him a
man on crutches stood watching the houses being torn down. That had
not changed. The afternoons were always peopled by mothers and
children under five, or by the aged and the maimed. All the
able-bodied, like the demolition men, were at work. He himself would
be back at school tomorrow morning. After his slight indisposition.
A chill? A bilious attack? The blood on the stair, the floor of the
ambulance, the attendants' hands. At his feet on a pile of broken
bricks, open at page 305, lay the grey remnants of The Beauties of
British Poetry:
   <p><squote>The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
   <p>And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;</squote>
   <p>He turned the stiffened pages with his foot. Another by Lord
Byron. Mrs. Hemans. Hogg. Two men with sledgehammers were poised
on a high fragment of surviving wall. They might easily fall and kill
themselves. This part of the city had worn badly. It was good to see
it go. How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people!
Seventy three. Fifty years had passed. You could expect changes
in fifty years. Every change after fourteen years was for the worst.
A plaque on the site testified that the work was being carried out by
a member of The National Federation of Demolition Contractors. On
it was a badge with a map of the British Isles. Great Britain and
Ulster were in black. On the circumference of the badge, surmounting
the Outer Hebrides, was a contractor's crane. A shovel intersected
Sligo and traversed Ireland as far as County Cork, where it emerged
into the ocean. A pick in the North Sea had its point curved towards
some coastal town beneath the Firth of Forth. A crowbar, its point of
balance opposite the Isle of Wight, floated in the English Channel,
extending, at a rough guess, from Plymouth to Brighton. Beneath all
this was the date, 1941, (he was four), and beneath that the motto,
\RESURGAM. The cripple had moved off. He overtook him quickly,
imagining the cripple's envy at his straight, retreating legs. He
turned round. The cripple's head, as if it always had, hung, like a
cartoon Christ's, upon his breast.
   <p>
   <p>He was nearer to his old home. You could see almost all of Leeds
from the crest of Beeston Hill, the roofs, the chimneys and the
steeples, the higher civic buildings, the clock of the black Town
Hall, to which he had listened, in his attic bedroom, striking the
small hours of those mornings immediately before he left. The
slightest earth tremor could level them. He could see the familiar
landmarks that he had passed on his way up. The Salem Institute,
Hudson's Warehouse, formerly Wesley Hall, the gas cylinders, the
truncated pinnacles of Christ Church. Some time ago, these had become
insecure and the constant passage of heavy and rapidly increasing
traffic had made them a danger to the community. The incumbent had
sat for weeks at a trestle table, with placards ranged about him and
fixed above the church porch on either side of what seemed to be a
tinted photograph of Christ, beneath which was written in white
capitals, COME UNTO ME. Who would go to that? The faded figure
held out its arms in a gesture of welcome. AN APPEAL FOR
RENOVATIONS TO THE FABRIC OF THE CHURCH. &pound;10,000 URGENTLY NEEDED.
PLEASE GIVE GENEROUSLY. SAVE YOUR CHURCH. Hardly a tithe was
raised and, with no regard for proportion, the dangerous finials and
crockets were removed, leaving four stunted growths of stone,
projecting from a square tower. They should have left them to fall
down. Nearer to him was the large dome of a building, formerly The
Queen's Theatre, The Music Hall, the Queen's Cinema, now an unwanted
fixture, described as an excellent site for future development,
becoming more and more dilapidated, devoid of players, stars or
audience. Of the advertisement board above the entrance, between what
had been two giant tulips, there remained only the word, TODAY.
Just visible below, however, the Palace Cinema, formerly The
Tabernacle, was still assertive. Its prices had risen, so they said,
from fourpence to one and six or two and three. It had risen in the
world. The city was senile too. Let the everlasting stars go out.
They would all pass away as one, a slow driftage of stardust,
crumbled brick and plaster, powdered flesh and bone.
   <p>
   <p>The dentist had his surgery in Cemetery Road on the very brow of
the commanding hill. In the congested burial ground on his left the
remains of his family from seventeen something were laid at rest, the
butchers, the publicans, their wives, and some of their children. His
father took flowers there almost every week and sometimes came home
with the stains of clay on his trouser knees. The five sons, now
dispersed in various parts of England, sent every year, with their
Christmas Cards, a subscription towards an elaborate wreath.
   <p>From the chair, as he was having his teeth tested and found
wanting, he fixed his attention on the landmarks below him, to
distract his mind from the pains of the dentist's probe. Four of his
teeth required treatment. Three new fillings and one about twelve
years old that needed repair. He had forgotten about that. The tooth
that ached was not to be extracted. It would just be possible to fill
it. Of course, they were paid more for a filling.
   <p> &mdash;Do you still clean your teeth regularly?
   <p> &mdash;Yes, of course. After every meal.
   <p> &mdash;And you don't eat sweets?
   <p> &mdash;No.
   <p> &mdash;Or a lot of biscuits?
   <p> &mdash;No. No.
   <p> &mdash;Mm. Your teeth are poorly resistant to decay.
   <p>
   <p>They gave you nothing to numb the pain of drilling. No cocaine.
No laughing gas. The drill began. He stared at the heavens and the
higher landmarks. He pinched his hand beneath the protective sheet.
Birds circled within his vision, circumscribed by the tilted position
of the chair, seagulls fleeing the storms on the North Sea or the
Irish Sea, sparrows, starlings circling the stunted pinnacles of
Christ Church, the dome of the Queen's Theatre, the Music Hall, the
Queen's Cinema, the derelict, wheeling backwards and forwards above
the Gas Works cylinders, the Salem Institute, and, nearer, settling on
the houses on the hill immediately beneath the window. Concentrate.
Transfer the pain into the hand. The birds soar as the pain is sharp
on the crumbling tooth. They settle and it is subdued. The drill.
The drill. They rise, they wheel and turn, around the stunted
pinnacles, poorly resistant to decay, the Queen's Theatre, poorly
resistant to decay, the Queen's Cinema, poorly resistant to decay, the
derelict, the excellent site for future development, for future
buildings, future derelicts, that will survive my teeth, my flesh and
bone, my son, who died before he saw the broken world, that may
survive my second or my third, their first, or be demolished,
excavated, filled, plucked out, root and all, teeth and children torn
out of their roots, the nameless flesh interred in nameless ground,
the dead to judgement torn, Christ torn from the tomb, the roots, the
judgement, the welcoming, the faded Christ, poorly resistant to decay.

<head>Maiden Offering</head>
<head>Short Story by MAVIS FOREMAN</head>
   <p>She supported the dying hero's head in her lap. <quote>Have no
fear, we shall meet again</quote> he murmured. Belinda smiled through her
tears for she too believed that true love reaches beyond the grave.
   <p>The End.
   <p>
   <p>I wrote with a flourish, the tears coursing down my cheeks as I
looked up triumphantly into my dressing table mirror. I am fifteen
and have just completed my first real story. I have written it all
sitting like this before my mirror apeing every expression of my hero
and heroine, sharing their every joy and weeping at their many
sorrows.
   <p>It is such a sad story I cannot stop crying, so it must be good.
A story has to be sad and very mature and frank to succeed these days
and I feel that mine is quite fearless. In a way the heroine is
myself and the hero, Ben, is the boy I am rather keen about although
he doesn't take much notice of me. Of course he is quite a bit older,
nearly twenty I believe.
   <p>My story has two thousand and one words. I know because I have
counted every word &mdash; two thousand and one!
   <p>Now I must dry my eyes and go and tell someone about it. I am so
excited I just cannot stop crying. It is reaction after all my
effort.
   <p>
   <p>It is now two days since I finished <quote>Death at Sundown</quote> and I
am not quite so happy about it although I still believe in it and in
myself. But everyone has pulled it to pieces and I feel the heart has
gone out of it. I think I shall do what Grandpa advised...
   <p>When I first broke the news to the family they were all very
thrilled and Mother said I must read it to them as soon as we'd
finished supper. My young brother, Billy, was rather fed up as he did
not want to miss his serial on the Radio and Father did not seem all
that keen either. Mother, I could tell, was really interested and so
was Grandpa. He did not say much but he kept looking at me and
nodding his head.
   <p>During the meal Billy kept trying to find out what it was about.
   <p><quote>Is it rip-roaring?</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>You'll have to wait and see. It will spoil it if I tell
you.</quote>
   <p>My Father looked at me then.
   <p><quote>I didn't know you were a writer, Julia</quote> he said.
   <p>Grandpa chortled.
   <p><quote>Takes after me &mdash; stories by the dozen once and a book</quote>.
   <p><quote>Really, Grandpa</quote>, I breathed. <quote>How many words?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, fifty or sixty thousand, I can't remember.</quote>
   <p><quote>Golly!</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>How many has yours?</quote> said Billy.
   <p><quote>Two thousand and one.</quote>
   <p>Everyone looked impressed and Mother said proudly, <quote>Julia's
going to be clever. I had a letter published once myself in some
woman's magazine, I forget which one. A household hint it was,
something to do with pegs.</quote>
   <p><quote>Pegs!</quote> said Grandpa. <quote>Did you say pegs?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, pegs</quote> said my Mother crossly. <quote>It was quite a good
washday hint. I can't remember just what now, it was a long time ago.
I got ten and sixpence for it though. It was the time we were trying
to get enough together to send you to that good school,</quote> she added
reminiscently to me.
   <p><quote>How much will Julia get for hers?</quote> Billy said.
   <p><quote>They pay quite a bit for a really good story,</quote> Grandpa cut
in.
   <p>Billy looked interested.
   <p><quote>Enough to buy a record player?</quote>
   <p><quote>Hm. It would have to be pretty good to get that much,</quote>
Grandpa said.
   <p>By this time they were all intrigued. Even Father seemed quite
keen to hear it.
   <p>So, after supper, we all settled round the fire while I read the
tale out to them with much dramatic feeling and, once again, there
were tears in my eyes when I came to the sad ending, but this time I
managed to keep them from tumbling down my cheeks.
   <p>There was quite a moment's silence when I finished and I took it
that all their hearts were too full to speak. Then they all said
together, ~<quote>Yes, it's good, very good,</quote> and Grandpa added, <quote>A
stout effort.</quote>
   <p>Only Billy remained quiet and when I looked at him pointedly he
said.
   <p><quote>It's a bit like that silly film we saw last week with that
smashing cowboy one.</quote>
   <p><quote>You are too young to appreciate it,</quote> I said haughtily. <quote>It
is written for grown ups, not boys of nine and a half.</quote>
   <p><quote>They seem to spend a lot of time making passionate love,</quote>
Billy said.
   <p>Mother coughed.
   <p><quote>Yes, I thought perhaps that was rather...</quote> she tailed off
lamely.
   <p><quote>Oh, but Mother</quote> I flared, <quote>everything has to be like that
now or it doesn't have a chance &mdash; risqu&eacute;, they call it.</quote>
   <p>Father grunted.
   <p><quote>I should have thought they would have caught their deaths of
cold lying about in the snow like that</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>Oh, but it wasn't snowing then.</quote>
   <p><quote>But it was the day he was killed. You said something about his
<squote>red blood on the white snow</squote>.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, yes,</quote> I said, <quote>but that was another day.</quote>
   <p>I was beginning to feel cross now and slightly disheartened.
   <p>There was a further silence; then Father said, <quote>I'm afraid
there are several bits regarding the Army that just would not
happen &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Grandpa cut in quickly, <quote>That doesn't matter in a story. One
doesn't expect one hundred per cent accuracy. If it's a good tale you
can get away with that.</quote>
   <p><quote>In one bit you said she was a beautiful maiden of twenty and
then later you say she has a squint,</quote> Billy said.
   <p>I glared at him furiously.
   <p><quote>I said no such thing.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, cross-eyed is the same.</quote>
   <p><quote>I said wide-eyed. All innocent maidens are wide-eyed.</quote>
   <p><quote>She didn't really behave like an innocent maiden,</quote> said my
Mother mildly.
   <p>Suddenly, I had had enough and with a gulp I jumped up and ran
from the room, my story clasped to my breast.
   <p>The tears came angrily to my eyes again as I slammed my bedroom
door. Why couldn't they have left it alone, saying they liked it and
then pulling it to pieces. Now, it would not seem right to me. Maybe
I should alter it to fit in with their criticisms.
   <p>Then Grandpa came in. He did not knock as he usually does, just
walked straight in. He went to the window and stared out not looking
at me and not saying a word. I gazed at his dear old back in the
shabby, tweed suit and the funny little bald patch peeping from around
the white tufts, a bit like a poached egg I thought irrelevantly, and
said sadly,
   <p><quote>I'm going to alter it the way they suggested.</quote>
   <p>Grandpa flew round then his old face shining and red.
   <p><quote>You do no such thing,</quote> he said. <quote>It wouldn't be your story
any more. Leave it be child. It's your very own creation. It's fair
enough. You'll do better, but it's fair enough for a start. You may
use my typewriter to type it out if you like.</quote>
   <p>My heart was too full for words. This was indeed an honour!
   <p>So I typed my story on Grandpa's typewriter. It is a very old
typewriter and some of the keys are rather crooked. I can only type
very slowly as I am quite a beginner so it took me a long time. I am
afraid there were a few mistakes but I altered them all in red ink and
Grandpa says it doesn't matter how badly a story is typed; if it has
real merit it will sell.
   <p>It was a wonderful moment when I pushed the paper clip into the
pages and folded it into a foolscap envelope. I put another in with
my name and address on it just in case. But, oh, I am sure it will be
published. It's just got to be...
   <p>
   <p>For several days I have been walking on air imagining my story
printed in the magazine &mdash;
<head>DEATH AT SUNDOWN</head>
<head>By Julia Lane</head>
   <p>Then this morning I heard the plump of the letters on the mat and
somehow I knew immediately that this was my moment. I raced out into
the hall but, quick as I was, Grandpa was before me. He was
straightening up and there was a long, foolscap envelope in his hand.
I could see my own writing on it.
   <p><quote>Shall we go to your room?</quote> Grandpa said very quietly.
   <p>I followed him with an aching heart; all the life seemed to have
drained out of me. Grandpa sat down slowly on the bed.
   <p><quote>I'm afraid it's a return,</quote> he said.
   <p>I bit my lip miserably and nodded.
   <p><quote>You mustn't mind too much,</quote> Grandpa said. <quote>Even the most
famous writers started like this, some have years and years of
frustration before they make the grade. Some never do,</quote> he added
under his breath. <quote>Shall I open it?</quote> I nodded dumbly and he slit
the envelope.
   <p>Yes, there it was, my beautiful story and the paper clip had
gone. I threw myself on to the pillows beside Grandpa and sobbed my
heart out. He let me cry for a little then tugged me upright and
handed me his handkerchief.
   <p><quote>Blow,</quote> he commanded. I did so and felt better.
   <p><quote>You mustn't let this beat you,</quote> he said. <quote>Try again, write
something better. One day you will go to the door and there will be a
little envelope with a publisher's name on it; in that moment, you
will feel it was all worth while. And look,</quote> he opened up my story,
<quote>your very first rejection slip.</quote>
   <p>I took it from him and read, THE EDITOR THANKS YOU FOR
SUBMITTING THE ENCLOSED MS BUT REGRETS HE IS UNABLE TO USE IT.
   <p><quote>He thanked me,</quote> I said in wonder, <quote>that was nice.</quote>
   <p>Grandpa nodded thoughtfully.
   <p><quote>Keep it,</quote> he said. <quote>One day you may be able to laugh at
it.</quote>
<head>Up the Elephant</head>
<head>Short story by ROY BOARDMAN</head>
   <p>AFTER tea Mum and Dad gave me the look they always gave me
after our first meal when I returned to London at the end of the
college term. They knew I was going out for the evening. Action and
conversation followed the usual pattern. I yawned, surveyed the
cramped room &mdash; the littered table, two armchairs, old football pools
and bills stuffed behind the alarm clock, the dominating television
screen &mdash; and said, <quote>Oh, well, I'd better go and let everyone know
I'm back.</quote>
   <p><quote>Where you goin', son?</quote> asked Mum.
   <p><quote>Up the Elephant, I think.</quote>
   <p><quote>You look after yourself, son,</quote> said Dad lighting one of his
hand-rolled cigarettes and leaning back in his chair, his striped
braces straining over his striped shirt. <quote>You know what the Elephant
and Castle's like. Mind you don't get up to nothing.</quote>
   <p><quote>I might go and see Pete.</quote>
   <p>Pete was the <quote>nice young man</quote> Mum approved of. We had been
contemporaries at the local secondary school until I had gone to
college, he into Local Government, <quote>He's a nice young man,</quote> said
Mum hoping to begin a conversation. But I had my jacket on and my
hand was on the doorknob.
   <p><quote>Well, see you later.</quote>
   <p><quote>Nice of you to 'ave dropped in,</quote> said Dad with terrible
sarcasm. <quote>Come again sometime.</quote> I heard the knob of the telly
click as I went down the stairs, and when I reached the front door a
blast of music hit me in the back.
   <p>It was twilight. The street was deserted and there were few
lights in the windows of the two regular lines of houses that enclosed
me. It was telly time for everyone. A few knife-edges of light slit
the shrouded sky. I stood on the doorstep a while watching it, trying
to decide where to go. A visit to Pete certainly didn't attract me,
the conversation would die too quickly. But I wanted to talk to
someone. Every time I returned from college I felt the need to meet
people I used to know, to see the life I had known, to re-evaluate and
see if I could feel some of the old desires.

<head>ALL THE GIRLS LOVE A SCHOLAR</head>
<head>Short story by Malcolm Bradbury</head>
   <p>ONE FINE DAY in late August, a little more than a year ago, I
put on some clean socks, pressed my trousers, and made my way across
the downs to Southampton, where I was to take ship for America. After
governmental minions had knotted my suits together and counted the
contents of my wallet, under the pretext of facilitating my
embarkation, I went out onto the dock, and there she was, the
R.M.S. Grand Cham, a huge wedding cake of a ship, sturdy yet
pleasantly worn after yeoman service on the transatlantic run. I
paused and scratched my ear, touched by the moment; I was going to
America, safe in this titan of the deep &mdash; and what leisurely, playful,
and even possibly lascivious hours lay before me! I gathered up my
hand baggage, which consisted of a portable typewriter and a briefcase
containing a full-size X-ray photograph of my chest and a crisp mint
copy of my Master's thesis, on the Influence of Dryden on Anybody,
which I had just completed.
   <p>I came fresh from two years of research, spent among the high
stone pillars and solemnly dedicated atmosphere of the British Museum.
I am essentially a provincial lad, lost in the vast, unwieldy city of
London, and the British Museum was the only place I knew. I used to
take the small red trains of the London Underground as far as
Tottenham Court Road station and emerge into the grey heady airs of
Bloomsbury. Then I would wend my way between the bookshops,
publishers' offices, and espresso bars, taking care not to go
off course into the void, until I reached the British Museum. I would
go into the Reading Room, where solid silence was packed hard and
green up as far as the bowl of the dome, and walk over, always, to
desk D-4. (After a few months, people knew that D-4 and Bradbury went
together; I was a member of a very exclusive club.) I would settle
down there amid the smell of leather bindings and leather desks and
the strange aromas of unguents worn by Middle European &eacute;migr&eacute;s,
who notoriously used to repair to the British Museum to write
seditious pamphlets. Sometimes I would go down into the basement
lavatory, where small men could be seen from time to time washing
their hats. Such eccentricities were commonplace in this high world
of scholarship which I now frequented, and my urbanity grew daily. So
this, then, was living.
   <p>At eleven, I would go out for coffee; at twelve-thirty for
lunch; and at three-fifteen for tea. In these interstices, I
conducted a love affair with a large, flamboyant, and rather rich girl
from Sheffield, who was also writing a thesis. I never saw her save
during the daytime, and our relationship was conducted largely by
correspondence within the museum. Notes would arrive saying <squote>I'm
mad at you. You said you'd have lunch with me yesterday.</squote> Notes
would leave saying <squote>Sorry, my tutor came. &lsqb;My tutor would often pop
in, and we would retire to a nearby teashop, eat buns, and discuss my
thesis, at the same time feeding crumbs to the mice that kept
appearing out of the wainscoting.&rsqb; But how about today? I'm your
friend.</squote>
   <p>When I accepted a fellowship in America, the notes came thick and
fast; she was very mad at me. I had that day taken my thesis to a
little bookbinder up Gower Street, who had hit the edges with a hammer
and put a binding on it, I felt very proud. So I took her out to
dinner in Soho, then to a theatre, and finally I took her home on the
Underground. We sat on a bench in some gardens near the river. A
sign saying <squote>HOVIS</squote> kept flashing at us from across the river,
but we didn't look at it. The seat was wet, and ants kept taking
things back and forth along it, but we didn't mind. At last, I
ushered her to her door and promised never to forget her.
   <p>Now I was off to America to face a more rigorous r&eacute;gime. I
was going to the Middle West to teach a course on gross illiteracies
to freshmen. The gross illiteracies didn't sound very interesting.
They included such deviations as the Unjustifiable Dangling Modifier
~(<squote>If thoroughly stewed, the patients will enjoy our prunes</squote>) and
the Fused Sentence ~(<squote>His bus was late he missed his train</squote>). I
realised that I was now finished with the cosmopolitan gentlemanly
days of English research; no more men washing their hats in the
lavatory, no more eccentrics talking on economic theory to the stone
lions in front of the British Museum. Now, if I wanted to do research
work, I had to take courses and acquire credits for a degree. But
first, I told myself, forget scholarship and the academic life for a
while: revel in the joys of a cruise.
   <p>Flunkies ushered me aboard the Grand Cham, and eventually I
found my cabin. It was a tiny cabin, no bigger than a good-sized
coffin, and it contained four berths, a communal set of drawers, and a
hand basin about the size of the bowl of my pipe. My three cabin
mates had arrived already; they were long-faced, dark-haired English
youths who looked exactly like me. One of them pointed out to me a
package from Interflora. It was white heather from the British Museum
girl, and the card said, <squote>I'M YOUR FRIEND</squote>. I then began to
unpack my briefcase. I lifted out the X-ray photograph and the
thesis, and carried them to a convenient shelf. Then I noticed a
curious thing. Already on the shelf, there lay three X-ray
photographs and three fat Master's theses. I looked at my cabin mates
inquiringly. They nodded. We were all on the same errand.
   <p>Bursting with bonhomie, we sat at the same table at dinner and
talked about Dryden and George Eliot and the criticism of F. R.
Leavis. Suddenly, in a pause in our conversation, we observed
something strange. The people at the next table were also talking
about Dryden and George Eliot and the criticism of F. R. Leavis.
So were the people at the table beyond that. Soon everyone was
turning round to look at everyone else, and it quickly became evident
that the vessel was largely given over to American intellectuals
returning from a year's stint in Rome or Paris or London and English
intellectuals going for a year's stint to the Folger or to Stanford or
to the palaces of cultivation in the Middle West. There were
English-Speaking Union Fellows, Commonwealth Fund Fellows, Henry
Fellows, and Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellows. There were
Guggenheims and Rockefellers, Fords and Gulbenkians. <squote>My
goodness,</squote> remarked someone, <squote>what a blow for the human
intelligence if this ship should sink.</squote>
   <p>It was a sobering thought. Perhaps, someone else suggested, we
should have been shared out among several vessels, so that some of us,
at least, should survive. As one of my cabin mates remarked, the
incidence of scholars was more than random; it was statistically
significant. <squote>You know,</squote> he said, <squote>the historians of race
migration have missed this. There's a thesis in it.</squote> I hastened to
assure him that with a passenger list of this sort no potential
subject for a thesis would be likely to go begging. <squote>Oh, good!</squote>
said my companion. <squote>I'm relieved. Because it isn't really my
field.</squote>
   <p>Already I was beginning to suspect that the passenger list of the
vessel was not my field either, and during the next day or two I could
not help but feel that the atmosphere was growing claustrophobic.
There were a few passengers without even their Master's degrees,
going to visit relatives or get married in the States, or returning
from a tour of Europe. You saw them occasionally, walking about
defiantly carrying copies of novels by Nevil Shute, and I, for one,
never let them go by without sparing them a few kindly words. By and
large, though, the passengers gathered in groups on the boat deck each
day in informal seminars, keeping alive the tradition of academic
debate during this tough, fallow spell while they were cut off from a
university and out under the open sky.
   <p>One evening, my roommates and I were sitting in our cabin
deluging our nostrils with heather pollen when there came a tap at the
door and a young American scholar we had already met (he was a
Swinburne man) entered. <squote>Hi,</squote> he said.
   <p>We said ~<squote>Hi</squote> back at him, and he explained that a meeting had
been held and it had been decided to formalise the discussions on the
boat deck by holding daily seminars devoted to comparisons of American
and European life and thought, which would keep our minds from rusting
and at the same time serve as an orientation programme for those
unfamiliar with various lands. People would contribute papers, and
discussion would be encouraged. <squote>You know, this is the greatest
opportunity we'll ever have,</squote> he said. <squote>We can't let an
opportunity like this go by.</squote>
   <p>There was, he had to admit, one painful drawback. <squote>We aren't
authorised to award credits toward any degree, but we don't think this
should stand in our way, and we hope it won't deter you from
coming.</squote>
   <p>We congratulated him on being so infected with the joy of pure
scholarship. He thanked us and adjured us to be present at ten-thirty
the next morning.
   <p>For some strange reason, possibly a decline in my metabolism, I
couldn't quite relish the prospect. I went to the meeting the next
day, however, and an eminent professor from Emmanuel College,
Cambridge, gave a paper on the cheapest way to buy potatoes in
England, and then there was a discussion about how to get off a
turnpike in the States. It was good, searching stuff, well presented
and well delivered, and showing the stamp of original minds, yet
somehow I didn't seem up to it, and when the Swinburne man, who was in
general charge, assigned us Moby Dick, to be read before the next
class, I felt I'd almost rather take an Incomplete in the course.
   <p>Fortunately for me, my fears of being bested in a debate on
Melville were relieved by a chance encounter, at the dance that
evening, with an elegantly proportioned American nurse, tanned as
brown as a berry by a two-month tour of Italy. I had no business
being at the dance at all, with so much reading to do, but I thought
perhaps he wouldn't call on me in the quiz. Looking on this
unqualified specimen of American womanhood, charming even without her
M.A., I found myself spiritually closer to her than I did to many
a scholar. I was, in short, tempted into silken dalliance. The
desire for knowledge, the desire to learn all there was to know about
the Weltanschauung of the female in America, egged me on.
   <p>I began my course of study the next day. I was, as I have said,
a modest and provincial English youth, but my companion seemed
inclined to thaw me. <squote>You're so polite,</squote> she said. <squote>It's cute,
but you won't snow an American girl that way.</squote>
   <p>She was telling me, in the late afternoon, how to snow an
American girl, when the Swinburne man appeared. <squote>Say,</squote> he said,
<squote>we missed you today.</squote> I apologised for my absence.
   <p><squote>We had a great class on how to use an Automat,</squote> he said.
<squote>Then one of the guys in your cabin talked about how to get
shillings to put into English gas meters. It was very interesting.</squote>
<squote>I'm sure,</squote> I said. <squote>I'm sorry I missed it.</squote>
   <p>Next morning, the Swinburne man was at our cabin early, looking
for me. I told him that I should most surely have joined the group
that day were I not working on a project of my own. He left, a trifle
dejected, and my project came along shortly afterward from her cabin,
where she had been putting on a swimsuit, and we went to the pool.

<text id=LOBK27>
<head>The Stile</head>
   <p>The mirror had a bevelled edge, so that by tilting it carefully
he could cut his eye in half quite painlessly. Now he had three eyes
and a harelip. He squared the mirror, made a cruel gesture with his
mouth, then put his hand down the front of his trousers to see if he
had more hair than Falkirk yet. Suddenly he noticed some flecks of
scurf that must have fallen on the mirror when he was combing his
parting. He began to worry about that instead.
   <p>The waiting was intolerable. And yet he knew it shouldn't be.
The bed was a secure island where he was immune from time. That was
why before going back to school, or before going to the dance as now,
he would set aside a whole hour for lying on his bed. It was a
rational device for delaying fear. When he panicked, and he had been
panicking for more than a week, he could say to himself, <squote>There is
still the hour. There is no excuse for worrying before the hour.</squote>
The strategem never worked, but he still enforced it rigidly because
the hour was the time for thinking.
   <p>Now he felt silly lying on the bed in his blue suit and his
ridiculous patent-leather shoes with silver buckles. He strained his
ears to hear his mother backing the car out of the garage; all the
time his breathing coming faster.
   <p>The other thought came back.
   <p>He bit his lip and cut his eye in half again with the mirror. He
rather wished the down would disappear altogether. Last term had been
bad enough. Their voices were still in his ears like trapped bees.
   <p><squote>Morton has a forest!</squote> <squote>With a waterfall in it!</squote>
<squote>Morton! Morton! Morton!</squote> <squote>Look at the Jelly Roll!</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm precocious,</squote> he said carefully, and aloud to the ceiling,
turning away wearily from the sound of their voices.
   <p>He wondered dazedly whether the term after next at his new school
everyone would have hairy Dings and it wouldn't matter so much. What
if his trousers fell off tonight and all the girls at the dance
started shouting... He reversed the mirror quickly, and as an
additional safeguard closed his eyes, so that he wasn't. But it was
not an easy thing to pretend: in no time at all he was again.
   <p>Then what about the doctor at last term's medical inspection? He
was still wondering about that.
   <p><squote>Stand up straight much?</squote> the doctor asked, and he began
tapping his teeth with the tongue-depressor he had in his hand.
   <p>Peter drew himself to attention and said, <squote>Sir?</squote> They had to
call him that; it was good manners.
   <p><squote>Play about a bit?</squote> the doctor said. He seemed
absent-mindedly to be cleaning his teeth with the tongue depressor
now; then he stopped that and looked at his fingernails.
   <p><squote>Football practice.</squote> Peter shrugged. <squote>And camp-fires in the
woods mostly.</squote>
   <p>Then he left the room for the next boy, wondering why the matron
who was usually helping the doctor had disappeared.
   <p>They were backing out the car. He panicked. Leaping off the bed
he scrabbled through his drawers. He must have something in his
pocket to show people. To talk about. He grabbed his bullet.
   <p>Then he saw his hairbrush. At school boys hit their chests with
hairbrushes to look like measles. His hand hovered over the brush.
His father would see through it though. It might start him on one of
those speeches about, <squote>When I was a shy lad, Peter-son.</squote> Then his
mother would say, <squote>You're a very pretty little boy, darling, people
love you. Be brave, lamb.</squote>
   <p>He shuddered, feeling weaker than ever, and made a tough, twisted
face into the mirror. He felt its contours carefully, and determined
to keep it there all evening. No; he couldn't because he loved
Rosemary.
   <p>Suddenly he knew he had been thinking about the Ding and the
scurf in his hair so as not to have to think of her. His legs might
melt away if he thought about her now. They couldn't make him go to
the dance though if he suddenly had to walk on his knuckles like the
pavement artist outside the National Gallery. He thought about
Rosemary, but her picture wouldn't come into his mind. He watched his
legs in their sharp trousers, but they only shook like the cotton
sails of a Firefly when the wind veered.
   <p>In the car he said nothing. His mother was going on to one of
her dotty parties, so she was practicing dotty remarks on him. She
was practicing smoking cigarettes too, because she only smoked them at
parties.
   <p>He had to be casual; even bored about the dance. If his mother
knew about Rosemary he would probably have to wear a paper bag over
his head for the rest of his life; if he didn't fall through the floor
of the car first and get crushed. He thought about that sort of death
for a moment or two.
   <p>His fingers moved from pocket to pocket of the stiff new suit
until they found the live bullet. If he held it against his head and
prayed, or scratched the tiny soft pimple of lead, it might go off.
<squote>Peter is dead,</squote> his mother would have to say. <squote>If there are
spare sausages and things I expect Rosemary will like them cold for
lunch tomorrow.</squote>
   <p>He thought about Rosemary's house. It didn't seem to have a real
existence in a real place like his flannel in the bathroom, or his
bicycle in the shed. He wondered how his mother would find it.
Anyway, she didn't seem to be able to keep a car going in a straight
line for very long, as other cars he'd been in managed to do. He
lurched against the car door, but the bullet didn't go off.
   <p><squote>Tipsy taxi,</squote> his mother called happily.
   <p>Peter was thrown forward. If he wasn't being pushed about by
people he was being bounced around inside cars like a rag doll.
Everyone else had the power. He began to feel limp, exhausted,
calmer; almost to enjoy alternately having his head banged against the
windscreen, and his neck dislocated on the back of the seat. He was a
punch-drunk boxer sticking it out. No; a Christian being thrown to
the lions.
   <p>He tried to feel himself dancing with Rosemary. Or rather to
feel himself stumbling clumsily after her as she led him with
movements light as an angel. The lurching of the car had dazed his
brain. Perhaps this year, dancing with her, he would get that strange
feeling he got that time when he crashed down on the tiny drip Hunter
in the rugger match and somehow just hadn't wanted to get up again, or
let go of him, though the whistle was blowing furiously.
   <p>Peter jerked suddenly upright in the car with his face on fire
and his hands shaking. The shock of the idea raised a lump in his
throat like a mole-hill thrown up in an instant of time. There did
seem to be something alive and scratching there too. He was in love
with Rosemary. It would be dirty to think of hugging her, whilst a
kiss...
   <p>He wanted to go to the lavatory, and laid his hand on his
mother's arm. She was wrestling with the steering-wheel like Tarzan
with the Wolf Girl and didn't notice. He forgot all about the
lavatory, and instead decided that if there would be any time in his
whole life when he could convert a try from the twenty-five yard line
it was this very second. Of course it would be with the Baby Game
rugger ball, not one of the full size ones.
   <p>He was beginning to hear the music of the first Paul Jones in his
head now. He knew it would leave him facing Rosemary, but that he
would immediately seize one of the forty fat ugly girls who stood each
side of her. Probably he would start to sulk in the middle of the
dance and have to pretend to be very interested in the pattern of the
wallpaper. Perhaps they would think he was an artist. The whole
thing might be bearable if her mother didn't sit there all the time on
the sofa like a queen with silver hair. She watched him too. And her
father could be just like his and say things like, <squote>Your playing
fields flood last term? My youngest lad's did, you know. Now do pull
yourself together and dance with the girls. Come along! Want a spot
of whisky? Ho! Ho! Ho!</squote>
   <p>Peter found that he was out of the car with unfamiliar gravel
under his feet. His mother wasn't kissing him. There was light in a
great glass house; shadows moving with music and laughter. Now a
brighter rectangle of light appeared in the centre of the confusion
and he was stumbling towards the open door.
   <p>Rosemary's mother was holding out her long hand like the branch
of a willow tree over the river. Her hair couldn't really be
thunder-sky blue. Peter took the drooping hand, and looked at her
just long enough to be polite, and to see if she was really like she
always seemed to be in his dream. She said something, and then
somehow willed him in to the dance room.
   <p>Music and movement was all around him, bumping against the walls.
He was snatched in to a revolving chain of boys; not, though, before
he had had time to notice that they all had real dinner jackets.
   <p>The music stopped. In the inner circle of girls Rosemary was
facing him exactly. She smiled. So he did. Then he shifted his feet
and looked at the floor. Now he was doing it; taking one of the fat
ugly girls on her left. He thought he saw Rosemary lift her chin in a
funny way. But he knew she must like one of the boys on his either
side better than him. He couldn't just take her like that
straight away.
   <p><squote>How old are you?</squote> the fat girl asked. <squote>Thirteen,</squote> said
Peter.
   <p><squote>You must be one of Rosemary's friends not Jane's then.</squote> The
girl was looking at his suit now. <squote>I have a little sister who
crashes my parties and asks kids of her own age,</squote> she added.
   <p><squote>How old are you?</squote> Peter asked stiffly.
   <p>The fat girl stared at him; pulling him around the floor as if he
were a sack of something. <squote>You don't ask a girl things like that.</squote>
   <p>Peter was exasperated. <squote>Well how do you know how old they
are?</squote>
   <p><squote>That is just the point,</squote> the girl said carefully. <squote>It
isn't intended that the male should know.</squote>
   <p>Then she let go of Peter promptly, though the music hadn't
stopped.
   <p>The music began again, and he was dragged into the revolving
circle of <squote>males</squote> inside which the smaller circle of girls was
spinning in the opposite direction.
   <p>This time Rosemary was nowhere to be seen and an ugly thin girl
grabbed him with more haste than was really polite. Peter
determined to get in first.
   <p><squote>Where do you go to school?</squote> he asked, pretending to be
interested and sort of intense the way his mother was at her dotty
parties.
   <p>The ugly thin girl told him. <squote>Why's it called a ladies'
college?</squote> he said. This time he actually was intrigued. <squote>Are
you very &mdash; are you grown up, I mean. At Cheltenham university?</squote>
   <p>The girl just giggled and pressed him nearer to her breasts.
Peter swallowed twice very quickly. Then the music stopped again and
he began to think there was something unsatisfactory about a
succession of brief relationships that were imposed and dissolved
wholly at the discretion of a loud gramophone record.
   <p>He caught a glimpse of Rosemary and at once fell into a trance.
It occurred to him that now he had seen her the vision might be made
to last another year, and so there was no reason why he should stay at
the dance any longer.

Finally Julian re-crossed his legs, and concentrated on the news.
When Janet brought in tea he said:
   <p><squote>Tell her we've got too many people coming, then. It won't
deceive her, but it will please you.</squote>
   <p><squote>No,</squote> said Janet, tired, <squote>I shall ask her. You'd make us
miserable if I didn't. I shall ask her. Have you taken your pill, by
the way?</squote>
   <p>He smiled and felt hastily in his waistcoat pocket, apologetic
with victory. Janet drank her tea and compressed her lips, warming
her legs at the large coal fire.
   <p>
   <p>They were assembled in the hall that was large enough to be a
room, drinking sherry before dinner, on Christmas Eve. Julian's
mother, small and stout, in a lavender woolly and lavender skirt,
smiled at each member of the family as they came up to talk. She
alone sat down, a dignity due to age. Janet's widowed sister, Doris,
trotted in and out with more glasses: a robust, sensible woman,
similar to Janet in appearance. The elder grandchildren drank
self-consciously. Julian's brother, Paul, leaned on the back of old
Mrs. Harford's chair, and avoided his wife, May. He had been
drinking too much again. Julian wondered why, and was too afraid to
find out. The youngest children were in bed, ready to wake at 3
a.m. and open their presents. Someone had given John a drum,
blast them. And Celia had telephoned in the afternoon, breathlessly,
saying that the car had broken down and she was bringing a friend &mdash;
was that all right?</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm not putting them in the same room,</squote> whispered Janet
furiously. <squote>I won't countenance cheap affairs at Christmas, with a
house full of impressionable young people!</squote>
   <p><squote>It might be a girl-friend,</squote> said Julian rationally,
untruthfully.
   <p>Janet gave a swift, sharp snort and flounced past him.
   <p>Julian's eldest daughter, the one person he loved as much as
Celia, was coming downstairs. She was happy to be home for Christmas,
and this time with her first baby to steal attention. Julian patted
her as she walked past.
   <p><squote>Everything all right, Sue?</squote>
   <p>She nodded and smiled. He hoped her husband, a nice enough young
chap, was good to her. She seemed to like him, anyway. They were
usually squeezing each other's hands and sidling together. Perhaps it
would work out, but time made a difference. Celia and that Forster
fellow had been wild about each other. Julian put up the money for
their elopement and never told anyone: it rankled with him.
   <p><squote>I don't think we should keep the dinner back much longer, do
you?</squote> said Janet, on a rising tone.
   <p><squote>No, dear. Of course not,</squote> said Doris, who agreed with her.
   <p><squote>Celia won't mind, I'm sure,</squote> said Julian, nervous for her
reception.
   <p>Paul smiled into his sherry as though it were having a private
joke. Old Mrs. Harford began stiffly to rise, helped by her sons.
   <p>Julian's head ached as he lead his mother into the dining-room.
All these people, he thought, and I don't care much for any of them.
What a stupid, expensive hypocrisy, family Christmas. If Sue wasn't
here, if Celia wasn't coming &mdash; nothing in it for me. Nothing in it at
all.
   <p>He looked down the double row of family faces, eating, drinking,
talking, and wondered whether they felt the same. And he counted the
people he had really loved, in his life: the ones he would die for,
gladly. There didn't seem to be very many. It was a bit of a waste,
spending your life with people you didn't want. Why not collect round
you the odd few you loved, and spend it with them instead?
   <p>A commotion in the hall. Julian's heart beat rapidly and he bent
over his soup and pretended not to notice.
   <p><squote>That will be Celia,</squote> said Janet, and scraped her chair back,
her napkin clutched in her large capable hand.
   <p>A flutter passed visibly round the table. Celia was a
disturbance, pleasant or unpleasant according to taste. The door was
flung open and Julian felt her presence a few feet behind him. Her
light, quick voice pattered out a vague and charming list of woes.
   <p><squote>Hallo, hallo,</squote> said Julian, pushing back his chair. <squote>Merry
Christmas, C.</squote>
   <p>He got up and took both her hands in his, kissed her cold cheek.
Her voice bubbled past his ear as she answered and kissed him, but he
could not have told what she said. Janet and Doris were looking
stuffy and mottled in their tight best dresses.
   <p><squote>Everybody's so smart!</squote> wailed Celia, throwing her fur coat on
a side table. It fell, with a silky thud, on the carpet. Someone
picked it up.
   <p><squote>I just came as I was,</squote> said Celia, and had contrived to make
the others feel over-dressed, <squote>in my old sweater and skirt. But I've
brought you lovely, lovely presents. Let me show you &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>After dinner,</squote> said Janet briskly. <squote>Do come and sit down,
Celia. And what have you done with your friend?</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh my God!</squote> said Celia, <squote>I forgot. Yoo-hoo. Mark, sweetie.
Come and meet my lovely family.</squote>
   <p>She was determined in her gaiety, in her clinging to a style of
prettiness which had suited her when she was young.
   <p><squote>Come on!</squote> she called, nervous and laughing. <squote>He's shy.
Poor Mark.</squote>
   <p>Perhaps he sensed that he was de trop before he came in
because his entrance was both dignified and defiant. A universal gasp
among the family. Celia had done it again. Lean, tall and personable
though Mark was &mdash; he was an African.
   <p><squote>What a terrible thing,</squote> whispered Doris, <squote>and mother the age
she is, too.</squote>
   <p><squote>At Christmas,</squote> said Janet.
   <p>Celia held Mark's hand and smiled into his face. She had the
ability to concentrate herself on one person at one time and it took
some of the uncertainty from his expression.
   <p><squote>They're awfully glad you've come,</squote> said Celia to him, as
though the room were empty. <squote>He plays the trumpet,
professionally,</squote> she said, turning to them. <squote>I made him bring it.
After dinner he'll play the blues. Markie,</squote> she said, touching her
throat with a gesture that tore Julian, <squote>just gets me when he plays
the trumpet.</squote>
   <p>Still the family had not come up to scratch. Her wide-spaced
blue eyes garnered and sorted the message. Her smile wavered.
   <p><squote>We're awfully hungry,</squote> she said, <squote>awfully hungry, Julian.</squote>
   <p><squote>Delighted,</squote> said Julian, jerked by her appeal into shaking
Mark's hand. <squote>Do sit down, both of you. You must certainly play for
us, if you will, Mr. er &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Just call him <quote>Mark</quote>,</squote> said Celia. <squote>Second names are so
unfriendly, and his is unpronounceable. How is everybody? Darling
Mummy, always so sweet. Doris. Janet. May. Sue, have you brought
little poppet? I must see him. Do you adore him frantically? &mdash; lucky
you. And dear Paul &mdash; oh, Paul.</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes,</squote> said Paul, <squote>I'm drinking too much, C.</squote>
   <p><squote>But why?</squote>
   <p>Julian wished he could have asked this, but he listened.
   <p><squote>Because,</squote> said Paul, <squote>a family is like a bloody great pillow
on your face. Suffocation. And I drink to forget that terrible
fact.</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh, Paul!</squote> everyone said, laughing to cover up the truth.
   <p><squote>I'm surrounded,</squote> said Paul, <squote>by people I wish well. I do
wish you well. And I wish you well away. You're all lovely. Good,
clean-living, strong-minded, short-sighted salts of the earth. There
is no spot in you. But for Christ's sake why can't you be salty
without me? Why don't you let me alone?</squote>
   <p><squote>We'll have a long talk afterwards, Paulie,</squote> said Celia,
touching the back of his hand. <squote>Eat your dinner, darling.</squote>
   <p>Comforted, keeping himself fastidiously from contact with his
wife or his wife's chair, he began to cut his meat into smaller and
smaller pieces.
   <p>Julian formed a picture of Celia by frequent glances. She must
be touching up her hair, it never used to be quite that auburn shade,
more of a russet. She had noticeable lines round eyes and mouth and
her neck was hollowed. In repose her face showed her age, but Celia
was rarely still. She was dressed in some pretty, fuzzy material:
dark, soft blue and no jewellery.
   <p><squote>You're looking well, C.,</squote> said Julian, and cleared his
throat.
   <p>A cross-current of conversation prevented her reply.
   <p><squote>But I always put my babies on pots right away,</squote> said old
Mrs. Harford, reprovingly.
   <p><squote>But it's such a waste of time, the book says...</squote>
   <p><squote>...and it saved nappies and got them into good habits.</squote>
   <p><squote>Put a pillow on his face and get him out of it,</squote> said Paul to
himself, <squote>it's kinder in the long run...</squote>
   <p><squote>I know you don't like sprouts,</squote> said Doris, flustered, <squote>but
you've no need to make such a fuss. One would think you were seven,
instead of seventeen.</squote>
   <p><squote>More gravy, Mother?</squote> said Janet.
   <p><squote>Staying in England long, Mr. er &mdash; Mark?</squote> asked Julian
courteously.
   <p><squote>I don't quite know, sir,</squote> said Mark.
   <p>His deep voice jolted the family, and two rows of heads ducked to
their plates, silenced.
   <p><squote>He's staying at my flat just now,</squote> said Celia, and they all
started to talk at once.
   <p>Julian, exchanging glances with Paul, caught a curious look in
Celia's eyes, of irony and sadness.
   <p><squote>I hate family Christmas,</squote> said Paul, loudly.
   <p>She leaned forward, at once aware of him: a child to be
comforted.
   <p><squote>Never mind, sweetie. Never mind.</squote>
   <p>And Mark could play. Licking his purplish lips, first, then
raising the trumpet as though it were a taste of wine: setting his
mouth to it as though it were a girl to be kissed. His long back and
legs, his narrow hips, arched into one effortless curve: an attitude
for the trumpet. And he played. The younger ones and Celia urged him
on. He drank water, rested, smiled, and played again. His music ran
in their ears, darker than his skin, sweeter than honey. They sat on
the stairs, listening. Old Mrs. Harford fell asleep. Paul,
stupified, shut his eyes. Julian stood, a little awkwardly, against
the newel post, and applauded loudly. He had little knowledge of
music but he wanted Celia to feel that he approved of her friend. She
squeezed his arm and smiled, translating him. Doris and Janet
disappeared, alienated, to discuss to-morrow's Christmas lunch, and
Celia's latest gaffe. Sue thought her baby was crying, though
no one else noticed. She hurried up the stairs: in the earliest stage
of loving him. She would have carried him about with her all the time
if it were socially permissible.
   <p><squote>Now, sir,</squote> said Mark to Julian, in his dark, slow voice,
<squote>what can I play for you?</squote>
   <p>He implied compliment and Julian was flustered, afraid of failing
him. Celia leaned forward, her hair swinging past her brother's bulky
waistcoat.
   <p><squote>Play <quote>Savoy Blues</quote>, Markie, darling. Jule doesn't know the
name but he knows the tune.</squote>
   <p>Mark began to make melancholy love with the trumpet and Julian
was stricken as by Celia's pathos at dinner. His eyes sharpened for
an instant with tears which he was concerned to hide.
   <p>What's wrong with me, this Christmas? he wondered, finding no
answer. Only it seemed to him that he was suddenly middle-aged and
had never possessed what he truly desired.
   <p>Composed, he turned to smile at Celia and found his mood
reflected in her face. He concentrated again on Mark, and clapped
louder than anyone else when it was over.
   <p><squote>Again, sir?</squote> said Mark, absorbed, respectful.
   <p>He had noticed something. Dignified beggar.
   <p><squote>No, no, thank you. I enjoyed it, though. Tremendously. Old
favourite of mine. Thank you very much.</squote>
   <p>Mark bowed and stood silent.
   <p><squote>I think we'll have some family carols now,</squote> said Janet in a
high, bright voice, <squote>and Mama must go to bed. Come along, darling.
Where's Sue got to? That baby of hers will be ruined. She picks him
up every time he cries.</squote>
   <p>As Janet passed Julian she stared through him; her powdery skin
flushed on the cheekbones; her best court shoes uncomfortable and
smart. She trod on Celia's fuzzy skirt as she sat, rapt, at the foot
of the stairs.
   <p><squote>Sorry, Celia,</squote> said Janet heartily, <squote>but we're getting Mama
to bed.</squote>

<head>Christopher Hollis</head>
<head>The Wind of Change</head>
   <p>THE FIRST white settlers came to the Highlands in 1904 and
therefore an old man like Kungo could remember a time before there was
a white man in the land. He had seen the Serkali, as the Kikuyus
called the British Government, come, and if he could only manage to
live a few years longer, there seemed every likelihood that he would
see them go. The whole business was turning out to be that of but one
long lifetime. Kungo sat outside his \thingira &mdash; his bachelor's
hut &mdash; and watched the hot equatorial sun going down the sky. He had
called to his senior wife to bring him some beer. She made her beer
out of sugar-cane and he preferred her brew to that of any of his
other wives. She brought him a calabash and he sat drinking it, and
as he drank, he meditated. The memories of a life came back to him.
   <p>The first white men to come to Nanyuki were the missionaries, and
the first of them whom Kungo ever met was Father McCarthy. That was a
very long time ago &mdash; more, far more, than a hundred seasons &mdash; for
Kungo always reckoned his time by the seasons of six months, since the
rains and the crops come every six months. He did not reckon in years
as the white men so absurdly do. Kungo remembered Father McCarthy
well &mdash; a tall, white old man with piercing eyes. He was a good man
and a kind man, and he and his fellow priests had taught Kungo and the
other tribesmen some lessons which they had been glad to learn. They
had shown them how they could plant their crops and tend them so that
the yield would be increased. They had cast a spell on the tsetse fly
so that it did not eat their herds and they could now drive their
herds into districts where herds had never been able to go before.
They had shown them how to build up their land on the hillsides in
terraces, so that the rain no longer washed all their soil away. All
these were good lessons. Once when his first wife was ill, Father
McCarthy had taken her to Nyeri to a bad-smelling house called a
hospital, where a white witch-doctor had cut her open with a panga and
snatched out from her stomach the devil by which she was bewitched
within. He had then sown  her up with a needle, and, after a
time she had come back to him cured and able to bear more children.
This, too, was a good thing to have done, and seemed to show that the
white witch-doctors &mdash; their \mundumugu &mdash; had more powerful spells
than had the \mundumugu of the Kikuyu. If so, it must be that
their God was more powerful than the Kikuyu's Ngai, and indeed Kungo
had for a time accepted the God of Father McCarthy &mdash; had become a
servant of the Bwana Jesus &mdash; and had defied the old law of Ngai. It
had seemed to him clear when his wife came back from the hospital that
it was the Christian God who now sat on Kerinyaga in place of Ngai.
But in his old age he did not feel so sure. A hyena had left its
droppings near his \thingira. He looked at them with disgust and
with terror. Father McCarthy, he well knew, would have said that a
hyena's droppings were a hyena's droppings and nothing more. But all
the Kikuyu believe that there is a \thahu &mdash; a curse &mdash; in a hyena's
droppings. Would it not be as well to go to the \mundumugu, to
kill a goat and get purification from the \thahu? He did not say
that the Bwana Jesus was not powerful for evil, as Father McCarthy had
taught. But was that any reason why Ngai should not be powerful, too?
Might it not be that there were many gods, all of whom had their
power for evil? and was it not sensible prudence to avoid offending
any of the gods?
   <p>Besides, though Father McCarthy was a good and kind man and
taught lessons which they did well to learn, he also said things which
it was less easy to believe and which Kungo had never been able to
find sensible. When Father McCarthy came, Kungo was still a young
man. He had just bought his second wife. Father McCarthy told him
that he should not have more than one wife. <quote>What then should he do
with the second wife?</quote> he asked. Should he just turn her out to
starve? If he sent her back to her parents, they would certainly not
return the bride-price with which he had bought her. Oh, no, said
Father McCarthy, he should keep her, but he should not use her as a
wife. This was plain madness.
   <p>
   <p>IT HAD seemed to him plain madness, but at least he had
imagined that, mad or not, it was the custom of the white man. Father
McCarthy and the other priests with him had a special \thahu,
placed upon them by the Bwana Jesus, which forbade them to lie with
women at all, but he soon learnt that this \thahu did not fall
upon all white men &mdash; that some white men did lie with women &mdash; and
indeed when, shortly afterwards, a white man, Bwana Dillon, came and
built a shamba and set up a farm amongst them, he brought a memsaab
with him and for a time he lived with her. Among the white men, Kungo
was told, a man has one single wife. It seemed a strange custom and
it was hard to see for what purpose a man would trouble to make
himself rich, if he could not buy more women with his riches.
Nevertheless, if that was the white man's custom, he had said, so be
it. Kungo was not greatly concerned to understand. Then after a time
Bwana Dillon's memsaab went away. They said that she had left him and
had gone over the sea to a country called England. For a time Bwana
Dillon lived, it seemed, alone. Then one day, he too went away, and
when he came back he brought with him another memsaab. He had, so
Kungo was told, been what was called divorced and had married a new
wife. Indeed after a time he divorced that wife too, and married a
third. Father McCarthy had left by then, so Kungo was not able to
consult him to find if he had understood it rightly, but it appeared
that among the white men it was possible for a man to have as many
wives as he liked, provided that he only had one at a time. This
surely, Kungo thought, was not a sensible arrangement. It was much
better for a man to have all his wives at the same time, as then the
wives could share out among themselves both the burden of the work and
the burden of child-bearing. The white man's arrangement did not seem
to him to be fair on the women. It is right that women should control
their desires. For that reason, said Kungo, do we circumcise them,
and, if one of my wives runs away to lie with another man, then, as is
the custom, I bind a hot stone beneath her knee-caps to cripple her
tendons, so that she can never run again. This is obviously common
sense. But how can one expect a woman to control her desires if she
is the only woman who can serve her man?
   <p>Kungo of course had, like all Kikuyu, ever since his boyhood,
lain with any girls wherever opportunity offered. Since Ngai had
given him his desires it was but natural and right to satisfy them.
He had always been careful in obeying the custom of the tribe. He
knew well that it was wrong to impregnate an unmarried girl, for to do
so would reduce her bride-price and would thus be an injustice to her
parents. Therefore he had never sought to lift the second apron which
all unmarried girls wear in copulation to guard themselves against
being impregnated. But to lie with a girl could not be wrong.
Indeed, if there were no fornication, how could the girls tell which
men they liked and which they disliked? Yet Father McCarthy told him
that fornication, too, was wrong &mdash; that it was wrong to lie with any
woman unless a man was married to her. This also he found strange and
once again, when he came to know other bwanas &mdash; bwanas who had not,
like Father McCarthy, fallen under the \thahu which forbade them
to lie with women &mdash; he found that this custom was by no means a
general custom of the white man. Bwana Dillon had after a few years
got tired of farming. So he started instead what he called a Country
Club for the rich bwanas and for bwanas who came from over the sea,
where they could go and get drunk when they got tired of looking at
the wild animals. Bwana Dillon hired Kungo to come and work in that
Club, and it was thus that Kungo came to learn something of the ways
of the white man. He had seen how in their dances the white men and
women held one another obscenely, the arm of the man around the woman
as if she was a whore, and as he brought them their drinks he would
often hear the white men talking easily and casually of the women with
whom they had lain. They did not know that he understood English and
therefore talked before him without restraint, but, though he did not
know all English words, he had early got to know the words which the
English most commonly used &mdash; such as those for food and drink, the
Government, and fornication, and motor cars &mdash; which were the subjects
upon which they mainly talked.
   <p>
   <p>WHAT Kungo could not for some time understand was why, though
those bwanas lay with unmarried girls and though the girls did not use
a second apron, yet it did not seem often to happen that the girls had
children. It was not until he was an old man that one day his son,
who, as was the way of the world, had left the shamba and gone to work
in a hotel in Nairobi, explained to him that the white women did have
a second apron of a sort, which they put on when they lay with men and
which guarded them against pregnancy. Or sometimes it was the man who
brought the apron as a gift when he came to lie with the woman. The
white woman's second apron was, said his son, a small apron of rubber.
He had often seen it among the luggage of the guests at the hotel and
a friend had explained to him its purpose. Kungo had then understood
why white unmarried women were not more often pregnant, but, if so,
why did they object to the Kikuyu girls if they wore a second apron,
which was surely in every way a more seemly and decent habit and in
accordance with the custom? White people, it seemed, when one looked
into it, did much the same things as Africans, though in a less
reasonable fashion. It was only that they talked differently and
pretended to act differently.
   <p>It was natural that a man should wish to beget as many children
as possible, and the more wives he had, the more children could he
beget and with the less inconvenience. A rich man &mdash; it was only
reasonable &mdash; would buy as many women and as fat and with as broad
pelvises as he could afford. Besides, since it was forbidden for a
man to lie with his wife for twenty-four months after she had born him
a child, for fear that her milk would fall on him and cause a
\thahu, or when a cow was about to calve, it was necessary that he
should have more than one wife.

   <p>He did well. He got in touch with the woman Pete was passing
off as his mother. Starmouth managed to win her confidence. It seems
that she was an honest enough woman, only her mind wasn't as clear as
it could have been. She showed him photographs. He found out that
the name of her house &mdash; Grand Greve &mdash; was taken from a bay in one of
the Channel Islands. One of the small ones. Sark, that's it. The
Caxtons used to have their holidays there. Starmouth went there. He
dug out some people who remembered the family. In the end he pieced
it all together.
   <p>The Caxtons had two boys &mdash; Michael and Derek. Pete first met
them at school. It was a good school I sent him to, one of the best.
He was a boarder. He could always turn on the charm when it suited
him. The whole family came to like him. The real Michael &mdash; he was
the same age as my son &mdash; died of pleurisy when he was eighteen. Soon
after that Pete staged his drowning. He was always a smooth liar. He
invented some plausible story or other and threw himself on the
Caxtons' generosity. They accepted him as a kind of substitute for
the boy they had lost. Outside the family he began to pass himself
off as Michael Caxton. The father was well-off and easy-going. He
was easy meat for Pete. He sponged off him until he died just after
the war. Then Pete had to look around for some other security. He
found it &mdash; Dackson's Wharf, and Dackson's daughter.
   <p>Mrs. Caxton's other boy, Derek, had been killed in the war.
After her husband died her brain began to fade. At times she thought
Pete was really her own son. Other times she remembered that both
Michael and Derek were dead. She couldn't work it out. She was
heading for a complete breakdown, Starmouth said.
   <p>Then Starmouth found out that Pete was engaged to Geraldine
Dackson.
   <p>(Up to this point Jesty had told his story in a flat, though
jerky, monotone. Now he grew more and more agitated.)
   <p>The time for my revenge was just round the corner. I told
Starmouth to keep on watching Pete.
   <p>Last Monday evening &mdash; a week ago to-day. God, only a week! &mdash; he
came to me. He had seen my son and another girl in intimacy.
   <p>(Jesty's voice became shrill; his body began to twitch and jerk.)
   <p>My chance had come at last. I had to take it. I was going to
smash him as he had twice tried to smash me.
   <p>(His eyes, wild and frightened, were fixed on Tong. Tong guessed
that they did not see him.)
   <p>I told Starmouth to go at once and report exactly what he had
seen to Dackson and his daughter. He did as he was told.
   <p>(There was a thin trickle of moisture at the corner of Jesty's
lips, but his speech was parched and unsteady.)
   <p>I thought that Dackson would ruin my son. I did not think he
would kill him. I swear that I did not want Dackson to kill my son.
I wasn't at the wharf at any time on Wednesday. That is the truth,
so help me God.</quote>
<head>12</head>
   <p>Carol Carstairs, interviewed by Passon and Tong for the second
time, began by agreeing that she could have been mistaken about
the precise minute of Dackson's visit the previous Wednesday, and
ended by admitting that he was in fact at least half an hour late for
his appointment with her.
   <p><quote>There it is,</quote> Passon commented afterwards. <quote>She is a
business woman. No doubt he paid her well for stretching the truth a
bit. She was his second alibi, of course. The first was the
television set &mdash; and a daughter loyal enough, or distressed enough, to
lie for him.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm more sorry for Geraldine than anyone,</quote> Tong said.
<quote>Unless it's Ella Marsham.</quote>
   <p><quote>When you think it over, Harry, it's difficult to imagine any
visitor to the wharf other than Dackson himself persuading Caxton
to step out on to the quay on such a bleak night. Caxton could hardly
fail to obey his employer &mdash; and prospective father-in-law.</quote>
   <p><quote>Pete Jesty, alias Michael Caxton,</quote> Tong said. <quote>Think we
would have got the truth from his father if it hadn't been for old Sam
Toberson?</quote>
   <p><quote>Who knows? At least Sam was one of the factors the commander
didn't bargain for.</quote>
   <p><quote>Another was the body fetching up on the mooring-hook &mdash;
practically where it started from.</quote>
   <p><quote>And you finding out about the spy at the Marshams',</quote>
Passon said.
   <p><quote>Just a stroke of luck, sir,</quote> Tong said.
   <p><quote>Luck or not, Harry, it was the real turning-point for us. Must
be true what they say. <squote>Tong can't go wrong!</squote> </quote>
   <p>Coming from Long Dick this was praise indeed. Tong laughed
happily.
   <p><quote>I'm a good dart-player too,</quote> he said.
<head>13</head>
   <p>The long brutal winter ended at last. The plane trees in
Southwark Park were wrapped in a delicate mist of bursting buds; mild
sunlight played with the grey face of the river; the railway
embankment along Railside Terrace was thinly carpeted with upshooting
leaves of new weeds and grass; and a revolution had come to the
Toberson household.
   <p>When Nick returned home he found that his mother was seriously
ill. She had pneumonia. The sight of her youngest son, the doctor
said, was the only thing that saved her; it gave her the strength she
needed to fight for life. Soon she was out of danger, but the doctor
told Dan that she would have to remain in bed for some time and that
thereafter it was essential that she should not have to exert herself.
Dan, not knowing which way to turn, took a desperate course. He
wrote to Rose beseeching her to help.
   <p>The First Flower made a prompt appearance on the scene, bringing
the baby with her. She announced happily that her husband, with the
help of the eldest daughter, would be able to manage very well, and
that there was no reason why she shouldn't stay at Railside Terrace
indefinitely.
   <p>With Grace helpless Rose set up her own autocracy. Her
squeaking, querulous accents were heard without intermission. They
rose over the baby's interminable howling and were directed at
everyone in equal measure. She was a poor and unpunctual cook.
Normally indolent, she was now and again seized with unpredictable
bouts of energy in the grip of which she swept through the house with
a fury that disarranged everything and left a trail of havoc behind.
Only the old man's room was too much for her. Once she put her head
round the door, and Sam shouted:
   <p><quote>You get right out of this, Rose. You leave me in peace.</quote>
   <p>Rose took one breath of the stagnant air.
   <p><quote>You &mdash; you polecat!</quote> she screeched, and retreated without
argument.
   <p>Her r&eacute;gime, hated alike by all the men, produced one
extraordinary result.
   <p>One day Fred met Nick at the front door as they were both about
to enter the house. Fred grasped his brother's elbow.
   <p><quote>Nick, I can't stomach this much longer.</quote>
   <p><quote>Nor me. What's the answer? Mum's picking up, but she'll never
be her old self again.</quote>
   <p><quote>That First Flower's driving me nuts,</quote> Fred said. <quote>I'm going
to put a stop to it.</quote>
   <p><quote>What with &mdash; arsenic?</quote>
   <p>Fred fixed his small eyes on his brother, beckoned him to stand
closer, and whispered into his ear the most unexpected words Nick had
ever heard.
   <p><quote>I'm going to get myself married,</quote> Fred said.
   <p>The next day he brought home a woman in her middle thirties and
took her straight to his mother's bedside.
   <p><quote>Mum, this is Maggie. I'm going to marry her, and I'd like her
to come and live with us.</quote>
   <p>Maggie was plump and plain with a pleasing smile, a placid
nature, and a slow-moving but methodical mind. For twenty years she
had worked in the bottling-store at the brewery, and Grace heard with
astonishment that Fred had known her on and off for nearly as long.
Grace, well aware of the turbulence that Rose was creating, was as
anxious as the rest of the family to find an alternative solution.
She took to Maggie at once; and at once began working on the problem
of how to accommodate Fred and a bride within the limited space
available. As always, old Sam was the stumbling-block. It was the
same dilemma she had to face when there was a prospect, now vanished
for ever, of Nick marrying Ella Marsham.
   <p>It was Nick who found the answer.
   <p><quote>Only one thing for it, Mum,</quote> he said, sitting on the edge of
the bed and holding one of her hands in his. <quote>Let Fred and Mag have
the two upstairs rooms between them. Sam will have to come out of his
kennel. The two of us will sleep in the front room downstairs.</quote>
   <p><quote>You won't ever shift him.</quote>
   <p>Nick patted her.
   <p><quote>We'll manage. Just you take it easy. We'll sort it out.</quote>
   <p>Nick went at once to his grandfather, and found him buried in his
bed with his head barely visible upon the pillow. Sam spent much of
his time in bed these days. He argued that it was the only place
where he could be safe from Rose.
   <p><quote>See here, Sam,</quote> Nick began. <quote>You know Fred's getting
spliced.</quote>
   <p><quote>Gone soft in the head,</quote> Sam said. <quote>Same as I've always
said, women rule the roost and no man's safe from 'em. Ought to be a
better way of doing things. Take trees.</quote> He rattled on very
happily. <quote>Trees have got the right idea. A tree's got more sense
than some people think. A tree don't have to worry. Just stays put
right where it was born.</quote>
   <p><quote>Sorry, Sam, you're no tree, and you've got to shift from this
room.</quote>
   <p>The old man was so incensed that after a good deal of wriggling
and twisting he managed to get his shoulders clear of all
restrictions. He propped himself on one elbow.
   <p><quote>You can't do it to me, Nick. I've worked this room up to my
way of thinking like I'd educate a child. This room and me
understands one another.</quote>
   <p><quote>Sam,</quote> Nick said firmly, <quote>either you and me share downstairs,
and we have Mag, or you stick it out up here and we all get saddled
with the First Flower for ever.</quote>
   <p>Sam sank back on his pillow.
   <p><quote>Oh, my God! All right, you win!</quote>
   <p>With that settled Fred was soon married. The First Flower
snatched up her infant and departed, muttering sarcasms. The whole
household listened to the dwindling screams of the baby with relief.
Maggie soon proved her worth, and after a time Dan summed up the
general approval by saying:
   <p><quote>She's as good a worker as you could wish for. She speaks our
language. Mag's one of us.</quote>
   <p>Nick and his grandfather shared their bedroom amicably. The old
man, though fighting a grumbling rearguard action, permitted himself
gradually to become a little cleaner and tidier. In his heart he was
well satisfied to have Nick's company. When they were alone together
he often explained all over again how shrewd he had been in
discovering Alf Jesty's secret. <quote>Imagine it, Nick, just that bit of
information Fred picked up about Pete Jesty always touching his nose,
and me remembering from that snap you once showed me that this Caxton
had some sort of a scar there. Just an idea to begin with, mind you &mdash;
then click! and I'd got it. That was smart work, say what you
like.</quote>
   <p><quote>It certainly was, Sam,</quote> Nick would agree, and go on to say
with a touch of self-importance: <quote>No wonder he tried to have me
suffocated back last summer. Must have thought I'd rumbled him right
from the start.</quote> By this time Nick was certain in his own mind that
he had really seen Caxton's hand snatching at the prop holding the
barge's hatch open, though he could never prove it, and it would not
be of much use if he could.

<text id=LOBL02>
But that was less important than the news that Sir Cedric had
visited Haines at the flat in Jarvis Street. Sir Cedric had never
spoken of such a call on the murdered man.
   <p><quote>Off-hand</quote> said Tarrant in reply to Oxenham, <quote>I can't think
of any of my friends who fits that description.
   <p><quote>Then you suggest that the information that you were seen in the
company of this man in Brighton is untrue?</quote>
   <p>Tarrant was irritated by Oxenham's tone as well as frightened,
and he made his reply as offensive as he could.
   <p><quote>You asked me whether I knew the man and I told you I did not
recall anyone who tallied with that description. Only a perverted
mind would say that I had suggested your informant was a liar.</quote>
   <p>Oxenham's face flushed slightly.
   <p><quote>I find your remark offensive,</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>That leaves me quite indifferent,</quote> snapped Tarrant.
   <p>Commander Rodgers felt the situation was getting out of hand.
After all, he reflected, the police had nothing against Tarrant.
True, he had sponsored Bianca Poravia, who had lied about her
knowledge of Haines, but what had that to do with Tarrant? Also,
Tarrant's car had been seen near Battersea Bridge, but the explanation
offered seemed reasonable enough and could not be disproved on present
information. Rodgers knew that Oxenham was merely fishing when he
suggested that Tarrant might be the limping man who had been at
Brighton. Plenty of people walked with a limp, and no link had been
discovered between Tarrant and the white-haired man who had shown an
interest in Haines.
   <p>Rodgers decided that the questioning must be brought to a close
immediately and he rose from his chair. He told himself that the only
reason he was stopping Oxenham from probing further was that he knew
Tarrant so well and trusted him. Not, Rodgers repeated, because
Tarrant was a senior director of the Ministry who was expected to
become the next Deputy Director General and who, even in his present
rank, exercised influence on the department's policy towards Scotland
Yard. Anyhow, he thought, it would be foolish to antagonise a man who
could be very awkward. The Commissioner of Police would not thank his
staff for precipitating a conflict with a highly respected and
responsible official of the Ministry of Security.
   <p><quote>We seem to have gone off at a tangent,</quote> said Rodgers. <quote>If
you should think of anything that will help us in the Haines case, I
know you'll give me a ring.</quote>
   <p>Tarrant gave a stiff bow and went out without a word. He felt
ashamed of his behaviour. He knew he had made use of his position in
the Ministry and his friendship with Rodgers to bulldoze his way
through and that almost any other witness who had behaved so
scandalously to the police would have been quickly pulled up. But he
had to protect Sir Cedric and himself, and to find an excuse to cut
the questioning short. It was no time to be tactful and considerate
of others. An insulting superiority had been his best defence.
   <p>The Yard, he reflected with satisfaction as he waited to cross
the road to the Ministry, had discovered nothing about the forgery of
Bianca Poravia's papers. That was a weight off his mind. He had been
prepared for Rodgers to say that the police knew of the fraudulent
application and to have the file placed before his eyes with a demand
for an explanation. That danger was not yet past, but at least for
the present no one suspected him of forgery.
   <p>But did the police really believe, he wondered again, that he
might be concerned in Haines's murder? Tarrant smiled &mdash; the idea
seemed too ridiculous. Yet the questions had seemed to him to
indicate that Oxenham suspected him. At one time Tarrant had felt
almost sure that the C.I.D. must have learned of his meetings
with Haines and know about the blackmail. He had been right to deduce
that, if they had done so, Rodgers would not have stopped the
questioning.
   <p>It was silly to feel indignant about being a suspect, Tarrant
reminded himself, when the truth was that he might have killed Haines.
He had intended to do so, and only his own lack of courage had made
him surrender the idea.
   <p>He had found it a disagreeable experience to have to wriggle and
be wilfully obtuse and indeed engage almost in a kind of juvenile
brand of impertinence, but how would it have helped the investigation
if he had told the truth? He could have saved the Yard trouble
perhaps by disclosing that he was the source from which Haines had
amassed the six hundred pounds and by identifying his father-in-law as
the white-haired man who had enquired in Brighton about the
blackmailer. But he had withheld nothing that would have assisted
Scotland Yard in tracking down the murderer.
   <p>He pondered on the significance of Sir Cedric Barker's visit to
Haines on the evening of the murder. The first thing to do, Tarrant
decided, was to warn his father-in-law. He could not depend on
intercepting him when he left the British Museum, and Tarrant made up
his mind to wait in the office until Sir Cedric would have reached
home.
   <p>Miss Paynter came in with a pile of papers when Tarrant had
seated himself at his desk, but he pushed them aside carelessly. When
he heard that Manning wanted to see him, Tarrant shook his head but
changed his mind and told Miss Paynter to ask him to come along. It
was an effort to discuss official work but Tarrant thought that he had
hidden his perturbation. Manning was not very observant, too wrapped
up in his own affairs to pay much attention to others.
   <p>When Manning had gone, Tarrant sent Miss Paynter home. He strode
up and down his room until it was time for Sir Cedric to have reached
his flat. He was relieved when he heard his father-in-law's voice
over the telephone. Another bout of probing by Lady Barker would have
been too much to bear.
   <p>Tarrant asked Sir Cedric to meet him and his father-in-law
grudgingly agreed to have a drink in a hotel close to the Barkers'
flat. When he arrived at the rendezvous, Tarrant had to wait for him.
He ordered a drink and took it to a table in a secluded corner.
Though he told himself it was impossible that Sir Cedric could have
had any part in the murder, he could not dismiss the thought from his
mind. Tarrant remembered how close he himself had come to killing
Haines.
   <p>When he saw Sir Cedric making his leisurely way into the hotel
bar, his light-coloured overcoat flapping round his legs, Tarrant
jumped up and went to meet him.
   <p><quote>You must get rid of that coat,</quote> he said urgently.
   <p>Sir Cedric stroked the material of the coat affectionately.
   <p><quote>It's got a lot of wear in it yet,</quote> he said, <quote>and I don't
really feel the cold.</quote>
   <p>Tarrant helped Sir Cedric to take off the overcoat and bundled it
on the chair, with the lining turned outwards. When he had brought
another drink, Tarrant repeated at length the exchanges which had
taken place in Scotland Yard. Sir Cedric sat apparently unmoved, but
at the close of the recital, he gave a loud chuckle.
   <p><quote>You were a bit rough,</quote> he commented. <quote>I suppose it might be
called bureaucratic licence.</quote>
   <p><quote>It seemed the easiest way to end the inquisition. You didn't
tell me you had visited Haines, Cedric.</quote>
   <p><quote>I felt it better you shouldn't know,</quote> said Sir Cedric
defensively. <quote>I hoped the police wouldn't question you but I foresaw
the possibility. I didn't want them to get the information out of
you, for I knew it would look suspicious.</quote>
   <p><quote>And why did you visit him on the night of the murder?</quote>
   <p>Sir Cedric looked rather shamefaced.
   <p><quote>I asked him his terms for keeping quiet about your forgery.</quote>
   <p><quote>But that was senseless! Whatever Haines might have promised
before he took your money, there was no way of making him keep his
word.</quote>
   <p><quote>I wasn't quite so simple, Bob. I told Haines that before I
handed over any cash, he would need to sign a statement confessing to
a crime for which he could be prosecuted. Then if he ever used his
knowledge against you, he'd know I could produce his confession and
he'd go to gaol.</quote>
   <p>Tarrant stared at his father-in-law unbelievingly.
   <p><quote>You really expected him to agree to that?</quote> he asked. <quote>I
never looked on you as a romantist!</quote>
   <p><quote>I was willing to try anything to end the threat. You couldn't
have gone on as you were doing, Bob. Even if Haines had kept quiet,
you'd never have known any peace and you'd have broken within a few
weeks &mdash; I could see it. You remember I asked you how much you would
give to buy his silence and you told me almost everything you
possessed. Well, I thought I'd make him an offer that would tempt
him. I told him he could have ten thousand pounds if he agreed to my
terms.</quote>
   <p>Tarrant gave a soft whistle.
   <p><quote>It would have been worth it,</quote> he said. <quote>But Haines wouldn't
play?</quote>
   <p><quote>I think he was tempted. But he was eaten up with bitterness
against you and this woman Bianca. He raved at me as if he were
unbalanced.</quote>
   <p><quote>He was a bit, you know.</quote>
   <p>Sir Cedric took a sip at his sherry.
   <p><quote>A pity somebody saw us at Brighton,</quote> he said. <quote>The police,
though, can't be sure or they'd have clamped down on you.</quote>
   <p><quote>I felt they couldn't be certain about my being there, but they
have your description and it isn't far out. That coat is dangerous,
Cedric. You must get rid of it.</quote>
   <p>Sir Cedric promised to carry the coat over his arm on the way
home, and when he went to the British Museum on Monday. Then he would
leave the coat in the Reading Room and let his wife believe it had
been lost.
   <p><quote>Best place I know to hide anything,</quote> he pointed out. <quote>I'll
stuff the coat behind a set of old religious sermons which no one ever
looks at.</quote> He patted the material gently. <quote>I shouldn't like to
part with it altogether.</quote>
   <p>If he had been asked, Tarrant would have said at once that Haines
could not be bribed. He had seen, particularly at the last meeting
with the blackmailer, that Haines was determined on revenge. The idea
that he could be induced to accept money &mdash; even though the sum was as
high as ten thousand pounds &mdash; as the price of keeping quiet was based
on a complete failure to understand Jim Haines's warped and twisted
mind.
   <p>And when Haines had rejected the proposal, what had Sir Cedric
done? Had he determined to kill Haines if he could not be silenced
otherwise, and, when the offer of money had been rejected, had he
steeled himself to murder?
   <p>Tarrant looked across at Sir Cedric on the other side of the
table and felt a rush of affection for him. He realised how fantastic
it was to imagine that his father-in-law could have had anything to do
with so brutal a murder.
   <p><quote>I'd begun to suspect you, Cedric,</quote> he apologised.
   <p><quote>That was pretty obvious,</quote> smiled Sir Cedric, <quote>and I admit I
once had doubts about you. The only thing that worries me is your
forgery of the immigration papers. I read that someone had left a
letter to be sent to the police two months after his death, and Haines
may have done something of the same kind.</quote>
   <p><quote>You read the wrong sort of newspapers, Cedric,</quote> laughed
Tarrant, but he felt less confident than he sounded.
<head>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</head>
   <p>OXENHAM FELT incensed that Tarrant should have been treated so
leniently and been permitted to dodge questions. The chief inspector
could not argue with Commander Rodgers, but, when Tarrant had left the
room, he showed his irritation at the way the interview had been
conducted.

<text id=LOBL03>
The nose is one of the most pain-sensitive organs in the human
body &mdash; and Malone was discovering the truth in scientific detail.
   <p>Kennan had only seconds left. He jumped forward to the far limit
of his chain, his right hand chopping edge-downwards in bone-jarring
force. The blow took the writhing thug a fraction above the boney
knob which landmarked the cervical plexus, the vital nerve-centre
which a long-ago Marine instructor had declared the pinnacle of
unarmed combat targets. The thug collapsed with a whistling moan, and
Kennan tore the Luger from the man's suddenly limp hand. There was no
time for rejoicing, but the hard, firm shape of the automatic sent a
new confidence surging through his body.
   <p>Shouts, and the clatter of feet meant Goldie and Leo Grundy were
on their way. Kennan pulled the manacle chain taut, and blasted two
shots at the link which tied him to the ring-bolt in the rock. The
nine-millimetre bullets smashed the chain as if it had been plastic,
and, free, though the chain still dangled, he threw himself across the
floor towards the entrance.
   <p>Leo Grundy materialized there at the same second, his gun
throwing down for a target. Kennan squeezed trigger first, and the
bullet, taking the other with blasting muzzle-velocity at close range,
high in the chest, smashed him back and downwards while Grundy's shot
bit splintering rock from the wall feet away, then whined in a double
ricochet. With scrambling intensity, Kennan hurdled the man as he
fell and was in the main gallery, looking for the last of the trio.
   <p>Goldie Lord was running, back down the rock-walled corridor, past
the tangle of camp-beds, stove, and collection of crates which marked
their base, towards the far end of the tunnel where the lights stopped
and a deep blackness marked the start of the way towards the surface.
Kennan aimed, then lowered the gun and began sprinting instead. He
couldn't, even in his present mood, shoot the man in the back. For
Goldie had no gun, only the open razor held in his right hand, close
by his side.
   <p>Suddenly the other man tripped and went sprawling, one foot
tangled in the rubber-armoured wire which snaked across the gallery
from the midget power generator. The lights flickered, then held
steady. Goldie lunged to his feet again, the razor flashing in a
frantic sidestroke as his pursuer loomed over him. Kennan threw
himself to one side to avoid the slicing metal, and swung the manacle
chain like a flail, reaping a bloody swathe across his opponent's
face, following it up with a blow from the gun-barrel which smashed
the man's forearm, the bone fracturing with an audible click. He
kicked the razor clear, then stood back, panting for breath, gesturing
with the long black muzzle of the Luger.
   <p><squote>My turn ... get moving ...</squote> he gasped, pointing back down the
gallery.
   <p>Tears of pain in his eyes, facial muscles quivering, Goldie rose
slowly to his feet and obeyed. Kennan got behind him, let him reach
the camp area, then smartly reversed the Luger and brought the butt
down hard on the other man's head. Goldie went down, jack-knifing
across one of the camp-beds. Limping badly now &mdash; the old familiar
ache in his leg started again as the tension died &mdash; Kennan heaved the
man over, rummaged around the collection of boxes and crates, and
found a length of cord. He used it to lash the man's hands and feet
together, then passed a few final turns round Goldie's body and
camp-bed frame, anchoring him securely. The Luger ready, he walked
slowly back towards the little side-gallery which had been his prison.
   <p>Leo Grundy was lying with his back against the rock wall, barely
conscious, his face suddenly younger and frightened, breath coming in
wheezing gulps. Kennan stepped over him, collecting the man's gun on
the way, and knelt beside Cutter Malone.
   <p>The knifeman thug was dead.
   <p>It was a moment or two before Kennan understood. The crushing
blow he had landed on the man's neck, paralysing the vital nerve
centre, by fluke chance had also been hard and accurate enough to
damage the delicate nervous lacework which controlled life's
respiratory action. Unconscious, Malone had died from lack of oxygen,
just as surely as if he had been strangled.
   <p>He felt sick. But there were other things to do than crouch over
the probably unlamented remains of Cutter Malone. Kennan went back to
where Leo Grundy was slumped, and eased the man back into a more
comfortable position. Grundy's eyes, wide and bright with fear,
followed every move he made.
   <p>The handcuff key was still in the twenty-year-old's trouser
pocket. With a sigh of relief, Kennan loosened the metal jaws, and
massaged his red-wealed wrist.
   <p>Now, however, he had another problem: What to do with the two
surviving crooks. Goldie? He could be discounted for some time, and
his bonds should hold until he was collected by MacTaggart's men. But
Leo Grundy &mdash; he bent low over the younger man again. Leo was as
vicious as they came &mdash; but in a way he was sorry it had been he who'd
stopped a bullet. Whatever his record, and Kennan had no illusions on
that score, Leo had been the most humane of the trio towards him.
   <p><squote>I'm going to lift you and get you on to one of the beds.
Understand?</squote>
   <p>Grundy coughed, and gave a faint mumble of acknowledgement.
   <p>He wasn't heavy. Kennan carried him over, and laid him down on
the nearest camp-bed, a pillow under his head. A two-gallon
water-can, made of bright-red plastic, was lying near by. He poured
some into a cup, and let the wounded man sip the liquid.
   <p>The eyes showed something akin to gratitude. But the red stain
on the front of Grundy's red woollen cardigan was spreading. Kennan's
fingertips were stained the same colour as he unbuttoned the garment
and loosened the shirt beneath. The Luger slug had made a neat round
entry just below the collarbone. Easing him up, Kennan found the
bullet's exit point, a more ragged wound, in from the shoulder-blade.
Grundy would live. His lung was probably nicked, but with no sign
yet of blood in his mouth he seemed to have been lucky.
   <p><squote>I'm going to give you it straight,</squote> said Kennan. <squote>I'll pad
up the wound, and send help as soon as I get out. If you stay still,
you've a chance. Try getting away, and you'll haemorrhage within a
hundred yards</squote>
   <p>Grundy nodded.
   <p>He found a clean shirt in a small suitcase, tore it into strips,
and used the resultant rags as bandages. Grundy was too weak from
shock and his wound to do more than watch. When it was done, he
settled back with a sigh.
   <p><squote>Answer me some questions.</squote> Kennan sat on the edge of the
bed, the Luger on his lap. <squote>How far are we from the Polley-Bland
plant?</squote>
   <p>Grundy swallowed, and mumbled a reply so low and hoarse that
Kennan had to strain to hear.
   <p><squote>About ... about forty miles. We're in South ... Ayrshire.
Takes about an hour, maybe more, to ... Glasgow.</squote>
   <p><squote>The inside man at the plant. He's an American?</squote>
   <p>A nod.
   <p><squote>His name?</squote>
   <p>Grundy tried to turn his head away. But he couldn't escape. He
swallowed again. <squote>Spence ... that's what Vince Benson calls him.</squote>
   <p>Gene. Since he'd lain chained to the rock, Kennan had realized
that there was no other choice. But somehow he'd kept hoping he could
be wrong. Now, he had to face facts, and concentrate on the other
important task still on hand, saving Big Betsy, the crucial item of
equipment on which the Polley-Bland contract and so much more
depended.
   <p>He lit a cigarette, and put his final question. <squote>How are they
going to do it? How do they knock out the transformer?</squote>
   <p>The fear of death was large in Grundy's eyes. He knew that
Kennan was his only hope of getting medical attention, and by his
standards it seemed logical enough that there was an unspoken threat
as to the consequence of failure to answer.
   <p><squote>Spence ... Spence didn't tell us. Vince knows, but he wouldn't
talk either.</squote> Grundy licked his lips, face white and desperate.
<squote>All I know is the time ... eleven a.m. Hell, Kennan, I ... I'd
tell you if I could.</squote>
   <p>Kennan tried again. But, his voice hoarse and weak, coupling his
words with a plea for a doctor, the little crook persisted that the
exact method to be used was a secret Gene Spence had refused to
reveal.
   <p>It was eight-thirty &mdash; only half an hour since the brooch and fish
hook trap had sprung. Time enough, Kennan knew, but leaving nothing
to spare. There was a storm lantern lying among the clutter of
stores, and he picked it up, took a last look around the underground
gallery, sniffing the faint odour of gunsmoke still lingering in the
air, then headed towards the black of the tunnel to the surface.
   <p>Compared with the main gallery, the ventilation tunnel was
smaller and narrow. Even with the wavering beam of the storm light,
he more than once bumped his head on the two hundred yard trip along
the shaft's rough, rising surface towards ground level. The last
fifty yards or so was at an upward angle of almost forty-five degrees.
Then he was at the heavy door at the shaft entrance. For a moment,
staring at it, he thought he'd have to go back and try to find a key.
But Benson had obviously decided he'd never be locked in from the
inside. There was a simple handle mechanism which governed the
massive lock.
   <p>The door swung wide, and he was free, in the open, standing in
the clean fresh air, the sun shining above, the soft, still dew-moist
grass springy underfoot. A curlew rose from a patch of heather only
feet away and soared skywards, giving its distinctive <squote>pee-wit</squote>
cry. He felt like laughing and crying, both at the same time. And in
the middle distance, the narrow tarmac ribbon of a road cut across the
dark green of the moorland.
   <p>Kennan dragged a heavy boulder over to the shaft doorway, placing
it in such a way that the door couldn't swing shut. Then, shoving the
Luger into the waistband of his trousers, he set off for the road.
   <p>Half a mile along the road, after tossing a coin and electing to
take the left-hand direction, he managed to thumb a lift. The driver
of the farm tractor had taken some convincing when he first saw the
ragged, blood-stained tramp waving from the roadside. But Kennan
still had his wallet, and money.
   <p>The tractor, its fare-paying passenger perched precariously
behind the driver, roared along the country highway at full throttle,
and after about a mile swung into a small plantation of fir trees.
The farmhouse was in the middle. More explanations, considerably
complicated by the fact that he had to explain the gun in his
waistband while the farmer's wife held an old-fashioned
single-barrelled shotgun pointed at his midriff, finally ended with
him being allowed to use the farmhouse phone.
   <p>While he waited for the operator at police head-quarters in
Glasgow to locate Superintendent MacTaggart, Kennan asked his
audience: <squote>What's the name of this place?</squote>
   <p>The farmer's wife, the shotgun now laid against the table but
still near at hand, told him. <squote>Aultdonald. About three miles out o'
Cumnock, mister.</squote> In her broad Ayrshire dialect she demanded in
turn, <squote>are you one of them Americans from the air base at
Prestwick?</squote>
   <p>He shook his head, and turned back to the phone as MacTaggart's
voice crackled over the wire.
   <p><squote>Where the hell have you been, Kennan?</squote> barked the policeman.
<squote>I've had a full scale search going on for you for almost
twenty-four hours now. The American Embassy's been howling that
you've got to be found, the Home Office joining in the chorus, and
I've been left holding the baby. What happened?</squote>
   <p>Kennan told him as crisply as possible, conscious of the
open-mouth attention of the two other people in the farmhouse kitchen.

<text id=LOBL04>
   <p><squote>Well, what do you think?</squote> she scoffed, her brilliant
eyes challenging him.
   <p>He made no answer. There was nothing to be said. He lifted his
glass and drained it, feeling the sweat breaking out on the palms of
his hands.
   <p>When at last he looked up she was standing right in front of him,
smiling as if nothing had happened! He could hardly believe it and
blinked several times.
   <p><squote>Well, don't I get a drink tonight?</squote> she asked boldly.
   <p><squote>Of course... anything you like</squote>, he murmured, relief flooding
over him. <squote>Kitty... I'm sorry....</squote> His throat went tight and
words failed him.
   <p><squote>Aw, forget it</squote>, she said cheerfully. <squote>I'll sting you for a
double for being a naughty boy. How about the telly tomorrow
afternoon?</squote>
   <p>He felt a glow of happiness steal over him. Everything was all
right now, thank God. She wasn't going to break with him, after all.
For the moment it was the only thing in the world that mattered.
   <p><squote>Of course, Kitty</squote>, he said fervently, his eyes misty behind
their thick lenses. <squote>Well, I'll be off now. See you tomorrow... and
thank you....</squote>
   <p><squote>So long, Bob</squote>, she said, waving her hand to him.
   <p>Harry followed him to the door, opened it for him and stood
outside on the step, looking up at the sky, where a few pale stars
shone between puffs of light cumulus cloud.
   <p><squote>Nice night</squote>, he remarked affably. <squote>But they forecast rain
for tomorrow.</squote>
   <p><squote>Do they?</squote> Bone glanced up at the sky, his thoughts
elsewhere. Personally, he didn't care if it rained cats and dogs and
he knew that Harry didn't either. He waited, pulling on his gloves
and adjusting his hat.
   <p><squote>Look, Bob,</squote> Harry began, after a brief silence, <squote>I don't
mean to butt in, but if you take my advice you'll 'ave no more truck
with 'er.</squote> He jerked his thumb over his shoulder. <squote>That girl's
nothing but a load of trouble, I'm warning you.</squote>
   <p><squote>Kitty's all right</squote>, Bone contradicted flatly. <squote>It's her
boy-friend that's the trouble. If we could get rid of him...</squote>
   <p>Harry nodded his grizzled head like an old hound.
   <p><squote>You're right there, Bob</squote>, he muttered. <squote>But it's easier
said than done. Kitty encourages him, too. No work, no background,
no regular money so far as I can make out. Probably on the crook.
But there you are, the girl's wild and headstrong. I can't do
nothing with 'er.</squote>
   <p><squote>Don't worry, Harry</squote>, the other said quietly. <squote>I won't make
a fool of myself. Kitty needs a good friend and I'll always be
that.</squote> He paused, hatred of Stevie Hewitt rising like gall in his
throat. <squote>And I'll find a way of getting rid of that chap, Hewitt,
too. Leave it to me.</squote>
   <p><squote>O.K., Bob, but watch your step. He's a tough customer,
mark my words</squote>, Harry said in a low voice.
   <p>Bone half smiled in the darkness.
   <p><squote>I'll remember</squote>, he said. <squote>Good night, Harry.</squote>
   <p><squote>Good night, Bob.</squote>
   <p>Bone walked down the road, his cr&ecirc;pe-soled shoes making no
sound on the asphalt surface. As he walked he concentrated on the
problem of Stevie Hewitt. By comparison with the manner in which he
had dispatched Henry Mansell the elimination of a little spiv from
Brighton seemed an easy undertaking... once he'd set his mind to it.
   <p>Back at the cottage he prepared his supper and ate it beside the
fire in the living-room, his thoughts once more on Kitty. If she was
really in love with Stevie Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying
about her, he told himself moodily. Yet it was not as clear-cut as
that. He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware of the
necessity to help and protect her, even against her will.
   <p>Tonight, for the first time, he had abandoned all pretence and
shown her the honest desperation of his feeling for her. She had
neither encouraged nor completely rejected him. In some perverse way
their brief quarrel had forged a bond between them. No doubt she had
every intention of keeping both of them on a string. On the whole he
probably had a slight advantage over the young man, inasmuch as he had
money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy respect for the
material things of life.
   <p>Towards eleven o'clock he locked up, turned out the light in the
sitting-room, and went up to his bedroom.
   <p>For several minutes he stared at his reflection in the oval
mirror on the top of the chest.
   <p>The toup&eacute;e undoubtedly improved his appearance and made him
look ten years younger. His skin was a healthier colour and he had
put on half a stone in the last few months, filling out the hollows in
his cheeks and giving him a more rounded appearance. But he was still
no sort of match for a young and virile competitor and he knew it.
   <p>He turned away and begun to undress, shivering with the cold.
   <p>His eye automatically glanced towards the panel which concealed
the hiding-place of his secret treasure. For an instant he stood
transfixed to the floor, his eyes unwavering as they riveted
themselves on the wall. Was it his imagination or was the panel
slightly lop-sided?
   <p>Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong panel
and pulled it out. The black tin box was exactly as he had left it.
With heavily beating heart he reached out and lifted the lid.
Everything was intact and he gasped with relief.
   <p>He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
to count them. Of course, he remembered being in a great hurry to get
that fifty pounds for Kitty! Obviously he had been careless in
replacing the panel, but the possibility of anyone having discovered
his hiding-place gave him something of a shock. As he replaced the
bundles of notes, he withdrew the tin box from its hiding-place and
locked it inside the cupboard. It would be safer under lock and key
for the time being than behind a piece of panelling which did not fit
very securely. Tomorrow he would buy a heavy padlock for the box and
search for a new hiding-place.
   <p>He lay in bed, cold and uneasy, unable to account for an
instinctive sense of danger.
   <p>When he closed his eyes it was Henry Mansell's face he saw,
hovering above his head like a hideous caricature. The parrot nose
and straight line of the mouth, the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to
strip him right down to his abjectly quaking bones. The mouldering
horror that had once been Henry Mansell taunted him now in the silent
darkness.
<head>2</head>
   <p>In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at Hawkeshurst
that Friday night Hugh Mansell and Roddy Dowell drank their beer and
waited.
   <p><squote>It's too damn busy in here. We can't expect him to leave his
customers</squote>, Hugh said morosely.
   <p><squote>Give him a chance, old chap. He'll be over. Jim's a most
reliable chap when it comes to picking up a small tip.</squote>
   <p><squote>O.K., Roddy, whatever you say.</squote> Hugh drained his glass
and ordered two more beers. <squote>I'm really beginning to feel it's all a
bit of a waste of time, anyway. I've been collecting scraps of
evidence and piecing them together for four months now, and the whole
lot still doesn't amount to anything one could call concrete.</squote>
   <p>Roddy puffed at his pipe, his eyes fixed on the white-coated
barman.
   <p><squote>Oh, I think it does, Hugh. That's why I want you to meet this
bird. I think he fills in an important part of the background.
Furthermore, dear boy, it confirms what we already know of your
father's intention to leave the country on the night of October
14th.</squote>
   <p>Hugh nodded. His face wore the melancholy expression that was
habitual to him but his eyes showed his inner excitement.
   <p><squote>I know, but from the moment he walked out of here we haven't a
shred of evidence to prove what happened. Obviously he met someone,
either by chance or by arrangement. Whichever way it was, that person
had a gun and he managed to persuade Father to drive along that quiet
stretch of road....</squote>
   <p><squote>Miles off his proper route to Dover or the airport at Lydd</squote>,
Roddy interposed quickly. <squote>And once there he was shot at close range
and his money smartly filched. You know, whoever it was might have
known of the existence of the suicide letter... providing him with an
almost unshakable alibi.</squote>
   <p>Hugh was thinking of his uncle, but said nothing. After all,
Julian had acted very strangely since the tragedy, always secretive,
always reluctant to discuss his brother's death. It was impossible to
associate him in one's mind with a cold-blooded murder but, in fact,
Henry Mansell's death had saved the firm and Julian's future.
Moreover he might well have been aware of his brother's intention to
skip out of the country and passed on the information.
   <p><squote>I'm sure you're right</squote>, Hugh said thoughtfully. <squote>But
whoever did it got clean away without being spotted.</squote>
   <p><squote>Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter, believe
me</squote>, Roddy affirmed solemnly. <squote>He probably caught the next boat
across the channel and has been lying low with the money somewhere.</squote>
   <p>Hugh nodded. <squote>I realized that after my talk with Mrs.
Lawford. There are a dozen countries where a man could easily hide up
and change the money without danger. Unless we can get a definite
line on him it's hopeless....</squote>
   <p><squote>Something will turn up one day, you'll see</squote>, Roddy said
confidently. <squote>If we plug away at the leads we have....</squote>
   <p><squote>If only the police would do something...</squote> Hugh cried out
in exasperation. <squote>I've put everything I know before them....</squote>
   <p><squote>No dice, Hugh.</squote> Roddy shook his sandy head. <squote>They're bound
to want pretty solid new evidence before they'll agree to reopen the
case. From their point of view the evidence for suicide is
overwhelming. I spoke to a chap from the office of the Director of
Public Prosecutions I know pretty well, and he agreed that the missing
cash is a hell of a mystery. But as he quite reasonably pointed out
the money could have been disposed of in London before your father
left that evening. It wouldn't be unnatural for a man in his position
to make provision for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded
as particular debts of honour before taking his own life. Also,
logically, there's nothing to show the money couldn't have been
pinched by someone passing the car after your father was dead.
Stealing from cars is about the commonest kind of crime in the book.
There's nothing that absolutely ties the missing money to the
circumstances of your father's death, that's the point. Same with the
passport. It's gone and that's that. It may turn up in a dustbin
somewhere or at the back of a drawer. As far as the police are
concerned there's nothing to go on. In our own minds we may be pretty
sure what happened, but that's not good enough for them. That suicide
letter did the trick &mdash; definite proof that your father took his life,
backed by medical evidence and the fingerprint chaps.</squote>
   <p>A little man with thin brown hair and a ruddy complexion came
over and greeted them. He wore a short white coat.
   <p>Hugh ordered drinks.
   <p><squote>I was sorry to read about your dad in the paper</squote>, the man
said to Hugh in a thick voice which bore traces of a cockney accent.
<squote>I was telling your friend how he come  in here the very
night he passed away.</squote>
   <p>Hugh wasn't impressed with this ingratiating barman whom Roddy
had raked up. He was seedy and middle-aged with small black eyes set
close together beneath heavily marked brows and a sly, crafty
expression that failed to inspire confidence.
   <p><squote>He was hitting the bottle pretty hard, sir...</squote> the man said
in a loud whisper. <squote>Meaning no offence</squote>, he added, looking at
Hugh.

<text id=LOBL05>
   <p>What had he really wanted to see? A copy of Hilary's will?
That wasn't impossible, though unpleasant to contemplate. A young
man of his ideas might feel he was entitled to know what provision had
been made for Hilary's daughter, in the event of Hilary's death. Now
that Rose was dead, the picture had changed substantially. There
would be no one to share the vast fortune with Lisabelle. She would
be the sole beneficiary, in the normal course of events, which would
make her a very rich young woman indeed.
   <p><quote>Sorry I was so long,</quote> Peter's voice made Mary jump guiltily.
<quote>I tried my hand at that cheese concoction I remembered you liked.
And heated up some soup. You deserve better than a cold snack.</quote>
   <p>He placed an appetizingly set tray on the cleared end of the long
table. He had not only taken a great deal of trouble on her behalf,
but had foreseen exactly the kind of food that would appeal to her.
Beyond this there was such charming friendliness in his manner, he
was such an attractive looking fair-haired young man, his eyes so blue
in his tanned face, it was difficult to steel herself against him.
But charm and good looks and attentiveness in small ways were
qualities essential to the fortune hunter. They bore no relation to
trustworthiness or character. Nor did Peter's gift for companionable
silence, grateful though she was not to be forced to make
conversation.
   <p>She heard the door open, heard the rustle of silk just as Peter
picked up the tray with the empty dishes.
   <p>He stood quite still.
   <p>When he spoke it was with an eloquent, far-from-Old-World,
~<quote>Wow!</quote>
   <p>Lisabelle's cheeks were almost the colour of the watermelon pink
silk as she presented herself for Mary's inspection. The dress
itself, the unusual care she'd taken to arrange her smooth black hair,
the lipstick and powder she'd put on with surprising skill had
transformed her. She had become a beauty.
   <p>She knew it, and the knowledge transformed her.
   <p><quote>I didn't dream clothes could make so much difference,</quote> she
said. <quote>You'll have to buy all my clothes for me! Although,</quote> she
added ruefully, <quote>I don't know where I'd wear them. Where I'll even
wear this.</quote>
   <p><quote>In New York, when you're staying with me.</quote> The opportunity
was Heaven-sent. <quote>Look, Lisabelle, you're to go back with me next
week, I'll guarantee you'll have a good time.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'd adore to go.</quote> Lisabelle's eyes shone like stars.
   <p><quote>Then we're all set. The job here ought to be finished in a
matter of days. We'll ring up the airport in the morning and get our
reservations. Luckily I have a guest room in my apartment &mdash; a tiny
one, but you won't mind.</quote>
   <p><quote><squote>Mind</squote>? It would be bliss.</quote>
   <p>Then the sparkle in her green eyes vanished. The excitement
ebbed. She said with the quiet of despair, <quote>But I can't leave
Dad.</quote>
   <p>Peter moved resolutely off with the tray.
   <p>Mary picked up a cigarette and lighted it, without speaking.
   <p>Lisabelle glanced appealing down at her. <quote>You do understand,
don't you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course I understand, lambie,</quote> Mary said. She raised her
arms, and for the first time Lisabelle leaned down and gave her a real
kiss.
<head>Chapter 29</head>
   <p>SUNDAY was another golden day of sunshine. A day when every
instinct rebelled against staying indoors.
   <p>The chances were, she wouldn't get the telephone call until
tomorrow, at the earliest, Mary thought. But there was a dynamic
quality about James Danford that made anything possible. At 10
o'clock Mary reluctantly rose from the canvas chair outside her door,
where she'd been basking in the sun, and went across the court garden
to the living-room.
   <p>She found that the last person in the world with whom she would
willingly have shared this tense period of waiting was ensconced
there.
   <p>Dora May was settled in a comfortable upholstered chair, Sunday
newspapers strewn all around her on the floor. Her feet, in
high-heeled pink linen sandals, were resting on an upholstered stool.
She was dressed entirely in pink. The black of mourning for Rose had
been quickly discarded, but not the air of importance that had been
imparted by the legacy Rose had left her.
   <p><quote>I'm waiting to see Cousin Hilary,</quote> she said. <quote>I brought out
the mail while I was about it. There are four letters for you. They
don't look very exciting, though.</quote>
   <p>Mary sat down in the desk chair, her back turned to Dora May's
gaze, while she opened the letters.
   <p>They were not, as she'd judged, very exciting. Mary was reading
the one from her assistant a second time, when Dora May's flat nasal
voice broke in.
   <p><quote>A little bird told me you had a real long visit with Manuel
night before last.</quote>
   <p>Mary put all her letters into her purse, rose without haste and
moved towards the fireplace. Despite the warmth outside it was cool
in here and the fire was welcome. She tossed the envelopes onto the
blaze, stood watching them a moment.
   <p>Somehow she must manage to cope with this wretched creature with
the tight blonde curls, whose every word and gesture irritated her
almost beyond endurance. There was no hope of dislodging her; she was
rooted here. Nor could any power on earth stop her from talking.
Mary realized that the part of wisdom was to accept the situation
without further protest, and, if possible, extract some benefit from
it.
   <p>After all, Dora May had been a member of this household for a
good many years. She must possess information that would be of value.
Even the least observant person would have learned a vast amount; and
she possessed abnormal curiosity.
   <p>The difficulty was not in getting her to talk, Heaven knew, but
in diverting her talk into channels of potential usefulness.
   <p><quote>There's no knowing when Hilary will be back,</quote> Mary said.
<quote>There is nothing for me to do but loaf and wait for a long distance
call about some materials I need.</quote> It seemed sensible to slip this
in. <quote>So, if I could be of any help?</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't see how. What I want is for Cousin Hilary to advance
me the money Rose left me in her will.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, I could hardly do that. Twenty-five thousand dollars is a
large sum. Although to Hilary, of course, it's peanuts.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's what you think.</quote>
   <p>The glint in Dora May's cold blue eyes was a signpost the least
discerning could follow.
   <p><quote>I'm positive,</quote> Mary said firmly, <quote>that twenty-five thousand
dollars doesn't mean any more to Hilary than twenty-five cents would
to me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then why has he mortgaged this ranch?</quote> Dora May's voice was
shrill with triumph. <quote>Borrowed every penny he could get against the
land, and the cattle and equipment, too? Just tell me that, if you
know so much about his affairs.</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't need to know much about Hilary's affairs to know he's
one of the richest men in the state,</quote> Mary said. <quote>You must have
been misinformed about his borrowing money.</quote>
   <p>She sat down on the sofa as if dismissing the whole subject,
picked up one of the papers from the floor and pretended interest in
its headlines.
   <p>Dora May rose to the bait. <quote>Hilary's lawyer's secretary is a
close personal friend of mine. I guess she's not misinformed about
documents she drew up herself! And came out here with the notary and
signed as witness, the very afternoon of Rose's funeral.</quote>
   <p><quote>More trouble in Africa.</quote> Mary kept her eyes on the
newspaper. <quote>Oh, sorry, Dora May ... you said something about
documents?</quote> She looked up, thinking, with wicked amusement, I
couldn't blame her if she slapped me! then shrank within herself for a
moment, as the wrath in Dora May's voice made that outcome not
impossible.
   <p><quote>You needn't high-hat me! I'm trying to tell you something for
your own good &mdash; if you ever want to get paid for what you're doing
here! And I'll tell you something else. You can put it in your pipe
and smoke it. So long as Rose was alive Hilary couldn't have
mortgaged everything he owned without her consent. And she wouldn't
have given it ... Maybe she'd be alive today if she'd been willing
to.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's crazy!</quote> Mary declared, but she couldn't hide her sense
of shock.
   <p>Dora May was gratified. <quote>You know as well as I do Rose didn't
kill herself. Why did you go to Dr. Summersby's office and ask him
about those pain-killers of Hilary's if you didn't suspicion
something?</quote>
   <p>On guard now, Mary resorted to counter-attack.
   <p><quote>Oh, I remember. You said once that Dr. Summersby's nurse is
a friend of yours, too,</quote>
   <p><quote>We went to school together.</quote>
   <p><quote>And the good doctor tells her everything?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, no. Not exactly. He has one of those dictaphone things
so she can keep a record of what his patients say. I guess he forgot
to turn it off when you were there.</quote>
   <p>Mary's mind flashed back to her interview with Dr. Summersby.
Just what had she said in the so-called privacy of his office? She'd
asked for the English valet's address, asked if she could go to the
hospital to see Manuel. Spoken of Hilary's plans for a festive
wedding for Manuel and Sarita. What else that Dora May's bird-brain
could fasten on? Or, was it such a bird-brain? Was she inventing
this fantasy of Hilary's desperate need for money? The details had
sounded disturbingly convincing. Hilary was no niggardly gambler. It
could easily be all or nothing with him. It was possible that the
notary might have come out the afternoon of the funeral. Lisabelle
and Peter and she had been riding and away from the house for hours.
   <p><quote>I certainly couldn't have given Dr. Summersby the impression
that I thought Hilary had anything to do with Rose's death,</quote> Mary
said. <quote>The question that bothered me was why she should have taken
her own life, if she did take it deliberately, when she had so much to
look forward to. I know all about the man in Dallas. I think she
would have been very happy if eventually she'd married him. As she
deserved to be happy.</quote>
   <p>Dora May looked up. Again she astonished Mary. There were tears
in her eyes. They were, however, tears of self-pity, <quote>She was the
only friend I had at the ranch. She knew what it was to be an
outsider ...
   <p><quote>I'm sure Rose knew that Hilary was going bankrupt,</quote> she said,
with another startling shift of mood. <quote>I think that's why she left
her jewellery to Lisabelle. Not that I mean to complain. Not little
old me. I just don't understand it, that's all.</quote>
   <p>She swung her pink sandals off the footrest, got to her feet;
elaborately smoothing the pink linen over her rounded hips, patting
her tight blonde curls.
   <p><quote>If Rose had made that will after we had words, I wouldn't have
blamed her. But she didn't. She made it while everything was fine
between us.</quote>
   <p>So Dora May had quarrelled with Rose! This was a new angle to be
explored. Had Dora May tried to blackmail her?
   <p>Mary took a chance. <quote>She probably didn't think you'd really
tell Hilary about the man in Dallas.</quote>
   <p>Dora May pressed her lips, making a small red pucker in her
over-powdered face. Her eyes were wary. Obviously she was wondering
whether denial would do any good, since she had no way of knowing
whether or not Hilary had confided in Mary.
   <p>Never had Mary thought the day would come when Dora May's silence
would be unwelcome. Now, as she remained silent,Mary could have
shaken her.
   <p><quote>Is it your considered opinion,</quote> she said at last, <quote>that
Hilary was responsible for Rose's death?</quote>
   <p><quote>Goodness gracious no! And don't you dare put words into my
mouth.</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't know how else to interpret what you said,</quote> Mary kept
her voice calmly reasonable. <quote>You claim Rose would never have
consented to Hilary's borrowing the money he needed. You said that if
Rose would have consented, she might be alive today. What other
construction can I put on it?</quote>

<text id=LOBL06>
People weren't enemies. They wanted to help.
   <p>When they'd reached the house she'd been swept inside to meet a
circle of faces and eyes and reaching hands, but it hadn't been for
her. She'd stood there, invisible. The eyes and the hands and the
quick voices had all been for the baby.
   <p>That was how it had been, and afterwards, too. Someone had
brought her up and gone straight away again, to the room next door.
Where the baby was. She'd heard voices in there for a long time.
Even now, if she went close to the communicating door, she could hear
faint voices the other side.
   <p>She wanted desperately to turn the flower-painted china knob on
the apple-green door, and go through, but somehow she couldn't. She
had a dreadful feeling that if she did she'd find she was really and
truly invisible; that eyes would look through her, and steps go past
and no one would see or hear her at all.
   <p>She thought desperately, I'm going crazy, then turned sharply
towards the other door &mdash; the one leading out to the wide,
white-painted corridor. She called, ~<quote>Come in</quote> and the door
opened, to release bright electric light into the twilighted room. It
bounced in, scattering gay colour into the carpeted floor. A grey
ghost followed it.
   <p>That was what the figure looked like. Grey and blurred. Hastily
Lea groped for her glasses again, and the ghost became a plump,
grey-haired woman in a grey pleated skirt and grey jumper. One of the
people who'd been downstairs in the hall. She didn't know which one.
All the names and distinctions had been jumbled up in her mind.
   <p>The grey woman seemed to know that, because she explained now,
<quote>I'm Abby Paladrey &mdash; Mort's sister, just in case you didn't get
things clear when we were introduced.</quote>
   <p><quote>How... how do you do?</quote> Lea rose stiffly, jerkily from the
window seat, striving to brush some of the creases from the cheap blue
linen of her skirt. She wished that she'd started to tidy up and
hadn't been found like this &mdash; a mess. She knew that was how she
appeared. She'd seen herself in the mirror coming up the stairs and
she'd looked terrible. All eyes and white hollow face and cheap,
crumpled clothes.
   <p><quote>Are you comfortable?</quote> Abby Paladrey asked, her bright gaze
going from Lea to the shabby suitcase by the bed. <quote>Not unpacked?
I'll send Edith up to help you then. That's Edith Camm. Our
housemaid. A good worker, even if she is silly about boys, or
rather just one boy. She's determined to get married and leave, young
as she is. They're all too independent these days. Mrs. Stewart
too. That's our daily, Rita Stewart. She's a widow.</quote>
   <p>She hesitated, as though expecting that Lea would break her
silence. When she didn't, she went on in her brisk, clackety voice,
that reminded Lea of nothing so much as a childhood memory of the boy
next door playing with a morse set. Clack, clack, clackety, clack.
It was just the same.
   <p><quote>It's not like the old days at all. In a place like this there
would have been two housemaids at least and a cook and a girl for the
kitchen and maybe more, but now it's get what you can and be thankful
for that. Why, I remember, even at home when I was small there was a
woman full time and another for the washing and the rough work and we
never had money or much, but even in Wales it's all changed.</quote>
   <p>The words had been flowing over Lea. Like the sea. Going in and
out. Softly, pleasantly. Lulling her. Then there was the big wave
of surprise and she jerked. <quote>Wales! I thought you were
Americans.</quote>
   <p>Miss Paladrey looked equally surprised. Her rosebud mouth went
into a perfect crumpled O. She answered, <quote>No. That is, Babby is,
of course, and Honor. And Eddie was.</quote> Her plump bosom went up, and
down, just like a billowing wave, before she went on explaining,
<quote>They all came from America. Babba married when she was sixteen,
which was worse than Edith, but there &mdash; they all seem to do it over
there. That was to Ed Anwood, but he died years back and then came
the day young Eddie got his draft papers, as they call them. He
should have had them before, only he hurt his shoulder at football or
somesuch and there was a long time spent in treatment, so it was all
deferred, but finally he went. Into the Air Force, that was, and next
thing they sent him over here to work out his spell of duty. So Babba
packed up and followed. Of course she came to see Ian and his father.
The old gentleman was dying then and when Babba made him an offer he
said yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>An offer?</quote> Lea was beginning to feel dizzy.
   <p><quote>For the place. You've no idea, looking at it now, what it was
like then. So Babby says, anyway. Even when we came it was different
to now. Babba's just poured money into it.</quote>
   <p>She was suddenly silent. Lea saw with surprise that the rosebudy
 mouth was no longer a bud. It was thin and straight and
tight. Then abruptly it relaxed. The bright little eyes looked into
hers and the clackety-clack continued as though the break had never
been.
   <p><quote>Ian had to agree to the sale because it was the only thing to
do, things being as they were. So Babba moved in and Ian took over
managing the place for her.
   <p><quote>And that was when Mort and I came into the picture. As I said,
we were brought up in Wales. Our father was a songster. Lloyd
Paladrey.</quote>
   <p>She was silent again; expectant. Lea said with embarrassment,
<quote>I don't know much about music.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh well,</quote> Abby didn't seem discouraged, <quote>he was too much of
a dreamer ever to do any good. People used him as they liked and he
never seemed to get more than a penny or two out of it. Later on Mort
and I came to London and he made a good little packet for himself. I
kept house for him and things were just perfect, Mrs. Beverly. Then
we went for a touring holiday. A coach trip, all over the place, with
a group, and one day we finished up at a castle. Babba was there,
sight-seeing with Eddie, who was on leave. She'd bought this place by
then and had settled in and she asked us to come and see it. She made
a lot of jokes about it being an ancient monument she'd restored for
England.
   <p><quote>Well Mort fell for her and that was that.</quote> She made a little
gesture of her plump hands, and the pouter bosom billowed again.
   <p>Lea thought, she said things had been perfect. She didn't add it
to present events. She looked into the bright eyes, but they were
expressionless.
   <p>Almost apologetically, Abby added, <quote>I seem to have talked
enough, but I wanted to put you straight about everyone in the house.
You looked dazed down there in the hall, as though things were too
much to take in.</quote>
   <p>Lea thought warmly, so I wasn't invisible to one person anyway.
She felt swift gratitude towards the plump, chattering woman.
   <p><quote>I was dazed,</quote> she admitted.
   <p>Abby nodded vehemently, <quote>Just like a Ferris Wheel, I should
think. Honor made me go on one once at a fair and I've never
forgotten. Up and down and round and round and never getting to any
place and then leaving you that dizzy...</quote>
   <p>Lea repeated dully, ~<quote>A Ferris Wheel,</quote> and shivered;
remembered a long-ago scene. She'd been tiny then. Her parents had
taken her to a fair and there had been a wheel, a great sparred
skeleton of bright red against the evening sky. It had gone round and
round and then people had been screaming and the wheel had come slowly
apart and had...
   <p>Crash! She was back in the nightmare. She came out tearingly,
to hear Abby saying brightly, <quote>But you'll be all right now.</quote>
   <p>Will I? Lea wondered. I doubt it. Unconsciously her gaze went
to the other door. Everything now seemed silent beyond it.
   <p>Abby hadn't followed the direction of the girl's gaze. She was
saying, <quote>So do you know who everyone is now? Honor was the tall
fair girl and you know Ian, and...</quote>
   <p>Lea spoke without thinking. She asked, <quote>What does Ian think of
being just a servant here now &mdash; in his old home?</quote>
   <p>Abby seemed to answer without thought, too. She said, <quote>Oh he
hates it, and us.</quote>
<head>CHAPTER FOUR</head>
   <p>Lea woke to the certain knowledge that something unpleasant was
to be faced. She lay still, staring upwards at the ceiling. There
was a shadow on it just over her head. She tried to make out what it
was, then rolled over and sat up, reaching for her glasses. The
shadow resolved itself into a large brown moth. It looked alien in
the carefully decorated pastel bedroom.
   <p>Like I do, Lea thought and glanced across at the communicating
door. She slid softly from the bed, padding over the thick carpet,
hesitating, then turned the china door-knob and went into the other
room, a too-thin figure in the fragile blue nylon nightgown.
   <p>The baby was still asleep. As always, when she looked at him,
she tried to trace some resemblance to herself in his tiny features,
but there was nothing.
   <p>Standing there, she told herself she had much to be glad for.
She had warmth and shelter and food and comfort. And apparent
friendship. At dinner the previous evening Babba had been friendly;
had striven to make the stranger a part of the household. So had
Abby, with her constant stream of chatter, about the dairy herd of Fen
House, about the Fens themselves, about their neighbours.
   <p>Lea remembered that Mort Paladrey had put an end to that, when
he'd interrupted one cheerfully scandalous anecdote with a terse,
<quote>That's libel. Isn't so. You're a mean-minded gossiping old
woman.</quote>
   <p>Abby's putty-blob of a nose had turned red. For a moment Lea had
feared a scene, then Abby had laughed; had turned the talk to
something else.
   <p>Lea was not sure of Mort Paladrey. Short and rotund, with
thinning grey hair and ruddy face, out of which two surprisingly blue
eyes stared at the world about him, he hadn't said much and nothing at
all to Lea &mdash; not after the first greeting and later, when Babba had
shooed her upstairs, he'd said goodnight.
   <p>Ian had said very little and Honor had just sat there, eating a
little, smoking a lot, never even seeming to gaze at the guest, but
always, when Lea looked away from her, she had the impression that
Honor's grey eyes went straight to her face.
   <p>That had been one of the uncomfortable things. Another had been
Jean McLone's firm, <quote>The baby's asleep, Mrs. Beverly. I wouldn't
go into his room now.</quote>
   <p>Lea knew she should have held her ground. Gone in. But she
hadn't. Something inside her had curled up in panic and she'd said
something vague and gone to bed without seeing the baby at all. That
had been wrong and she'd wondered if downstairs they would comment on
it and say she didn't seem to love the baby.
   <p>She wondered if they wouldn't be right. She was acting
selfishly, denying the baby a name &mdash; but perhaps she was giving him
more than a name. He had security, comfort, for a little at least.
Far more than ever she could hope to give him. She didn't dare think
ahead, to the day when she would have to tell about Arthur, confess
she'd preyed on these people, for the sake of a few months of comfort.
She'd been mad to come and yet...
   <p>There'd been one more uncomfortable thing, too, before she'd
fallen asleep. Edith Camm coming into the bedroom just after Lea had
slipped between the sheets &mdash; apple-green sheets that matched the walls
and had made Lea feel as though she was part of a great apple-green
meringue.

<text id=LOBL07>
   <p><quote>I'm very grateful to you.</quote>
   <p><quote>You needn't be. I told you, I'm glad to do it.</quote>
   <p>I was touched and flattered by his manner, which was most
attractive in its friendliness. As I said, I do not make friends
easily; my defences go up at the first sign of intimacy and when
people realise this, they withdraw. This young man was ignoring the
defences and I liked him for it. It did not occur to me until a long
time afterwards that he was, perhaps, a shade too friendly.
   <p>Now all I had to do was to tell Max and that, I knew, was going
to be difficult. He called for me soon after I got back to the flat
and I made him wait until I had a quick bath and changed into a white
linen dress. There must have been something about my appearance that
he found disturbing because he looked at me as though seeing me for
the first time.
   <p><quote>That was worth waiting for,</quote> he said. <quote>You must be the
freshest thing in London.</quote>
   <p><quote>The water was cold,</quote> I told him. <quote>It nearly always is.</quote>
   <p>His fingers lightly brushed something &mdash; powder perhaps &mdash; from my
cheek. <quote>Cold water suits you. Don't complain.</quote>
   <p><quote>I wasn't going to,</quote> I said. <quote>I shan't be here much
longer.</quote>
   <p><quote>I know. You're coming to Greece with me.</quote>
   <p>I moved away. <quote>No, Max. At least not yet. There's something
I've got to do first.</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course, the trousseau.</quote> He was refusing to take me
seriously. <quote>Tell me about it while we eat.</quote>
   <p>He chose a Greek restaurant in Soho, to get me used to the food,
he said. It was a quiet place and I was glad; I needed to be able to
talk. As soon as the meal was ordered I said: <quote>I went back to
Bletcham today.</quote>
   <p><quote>To Bletcham?</quote> The word was heavily underlined with
surprise. <quote>I thought we'd finished with all that.</quote>
   <p><quote>I was afraid you'd think so, but I've only just started. I'm
going to buy a boat and moor it near Hardy's house,</quote> I rushed on.
<quote>I'm going to find out everything I can about him.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why?</quote>
   <p>The question took me by surprise. <quote>Because,</quote> I said
impatiently, <quote>he may be the man who murdered Alice.</quote>
   <p><quote>And what if he is? He'll be tried &mdash; if you can prove
anything &mdash; and you'll be a witness. You surely don't want to drag the
whole thing up again.</quote>
   <p><quote>If he's guilty I'll go through anything to get him
convicted.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why?</quote> he asked again. <quote>I can tell by your voice that it
means a lot to you, but I'm damned if I can see the reason. It's not
as if you were all that fond of Alice.</quote> He was interrupted by the
arrival of the food and wine. When the pouring ritual was over he
went on: <quote>I'm as keen as the next man on justice being done and all
the rest of it, but I'd rather see you happy.</quote>
   <p><quote>There won't be any happiness for me until I can prove him
guilty.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're already certain that he did it, aren't you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not quite. Well &mdash; yes, perhaps I am,</quote> I admitted. <quote>I have
to be. If he didn't do it it must have been &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Must have been who?</quote> Max prompted.
   <p>I looked into his eyes and longed with all my heart to tell him,
but I could not do it. As long as my suspicion remained in my head I
could pretend to myself, in moments of optimism, that it was not true.
If I told Max he might agree with me and then I could no longer
pretend.
   <p><quote>It could have been anyone,</quote> I said lamely.
   <p><quote>So you're going to live in this boat, though you know nothing
about boats, and try to prove Hardy's guilt so we can be quite sure
that <squote>anyone</squote> &mdash;</quote> there was a glint of humour in his eyes as he
said the word &mdash; <quote>that <squote>anyone</squote> was innocent. If you're right, you
may be in serious danger from Hardy. Even if you're wrong you'll most
certainly be in danger when you start handling a boat.</quote> He picked
up his glass and held it in both hands, looking at me thoughtfully
over the top of it. <quote>No,</quote> he said at last. <quote>I can't allow it.</quote>
   <p><quote>You can't very well stop me.</quote>
   <p><quote>I can do better than that. If we were to get married now I
could come with you.</quote>
   <p>I looked down at my plate, not daring to let him see how much the
idea appealed to me, reminding myself that he could only have said
such a thing because he did not know the whole truth. <quote>And I can't
allow that,</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>Deadlock,</quote> said Max.
   <p><quote>No, it isn't. I'm determined to go, and by myself, whatever
you say.</quote>
   <p><quote>I was afraid of that.</quote> He sounded resigned but none the less
hopeful. <quote>You're a very wilful woman but I'll change your mind for
you one of these days. The thing is: when? I can't wait for ever,
you know.</quote>
   <p><quote>I know. Just give me a little time, Max, say three months. If
I haven't discovered anything by then I'll give up trying.</quote>
   <p><quote>And marry me?</quote>
   <p><quote>And marry you.</quote>
<head>CHAPTER SIX</head>
   <p>THE MAN from the newspaper office rang up two days later. He
gave his name as Clive Mortimer and pronounced favourably on the boat,
which was moored two miles up the river from Bletcham. <quote>You can see
it any time you like,</quote> he told me. <quote>The sooner the better. If you
can get to Bletcham this evening I'll run you up there in the car.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's very nice of you.</quote>
   <p><quote>Nice, nothing. I told you, I'm mad about boats. Seven thirty
do you? I could meet you at the bus station.</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> I said, <quote>outside your office.</quote> I could not endure
the thought of another wait at the bus station.
   <p>He was there punctually. Dressed in a loud tartan shirt and
abbreviated shorts he looked hardly more than a boy, a cheerful,
good-natured boy. He settled me into the car with touching care and
then drove like a fiend along the river road. Ten minutes later he
stopped in a lane and helped me out with the same careful courtesy.
   <p><quote>What sort of boat is it?</quote> I asked.
   <p><quote>She,</quote> he corrected. <quote>She's a converted life-boat. Not a
very good one, but she's sound enough and the engine's fine.</quote>
   <p>We walked down to the river's edge. There were a lot of boats
moored there and he pointed to the one I was already beginning to
think of as mine.
   <p><quote>That's her,</quote> he said. <quote>Sandpiper.</quote>
   <p>She was not an eye-catching craft. Years ago in her
white-painted infancy she must have hung presentably on the deck of
some luxury liner but now she looked like a gaudy ark, with a
top-heavy cabin streaked with layers of red and green and black paint.
Inside, she was untidy and grubby but roomy enough and well lit by
two rows of good-sized windows. It was a long time before I got used
to calling them portholes.
   <p>The owner was a middle-aged man whose family had tired of the
limited excitement of the river and now had their eyes on a seagoing
boat. Clive &mdash; he insisted on being called Clive &mdash; haggled with him
and within half an hour Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
fifty pounds. When all the business details had been settled and the
owner had departed with my cheque in his pocket, Clive started the
engine and gave me my first lesson in manoeuvring up and down the
river and in and out of the other boats. It was a warm, still
evening; the plop of fish and the gentle putter of the engine were
infinitely soothing after city noises, and I began to look forward to
my life on the water. At last he pronounced me riverworthy and wanted
to know when I would be moving in.
   <p><quote>At the end of next week,</quote> I told him. <quote>I shall have to give
a week's notice at the flat.</quote>
   <p><quote>I suppose you'll be mooring her nearer the sea.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not much. There's a place just below Bletcham, near the
footbridge.</quote>
   <p><quote>I know it.</quote> He looked doubtful. <quote>There are better
places,</quote> he commented.
   <p><quote>I know, but that's where I'm going.</quote>
   <p>He stroked Sandpiper's wheel lovingly. <quote>Take her down there
for you if you like.</quote>
   <p>He looked so like a small boy longing to play with someone else's
toy that I laughed. <quote>No, thank you, Clive. I shall be able to
manage.</quote>
   <p>There was a pub in the lane where the car was parked; to soften
the blow and also to thank him for his trouble I gave him a drink.
Afterwards he drove me back to Bletcham and we parted like old
friends. He suggested another meeting, but I refused; the boat was
such an attraction that I was afraid, if he came near it again, that I
should never see the last of him.
   <p>The following Friday I moved out of my flat, and Max, who was
still &mdash; justifiably &mdash; doubtful of my ability to manage a boat, came to
help. We piled all my things into his car and drove down to that part
of the river where the boat was moored.
   <p>The moment he saw Sandpiper I knew by the look on his face
that he had not much faith in her.
   <p><quote>That fellow Mortimer,</quote> he said, <quote>wants his head seeing to.
This must be the original ark.</quote>
   <p><quote>I thought so too, at first, but it's quite nice inside. Come
and have a look.</quote>
   <p>We climbed aboard and he eased his wiry frame through the cabin
door and wandered about inside, opening everything that would open. I
guessed he was looking for leaks and waited anxiously for him to say
he had found one, but his only comment was: ~<quote>Plenty of room in here
for two,</quote> a remark it seemed safer to ignore. Like Clive, he was
enthusiastic about the engine and decided, apparently on the strength
of its efficiency, that Sandpiper was fit to live in.
   <p>I was more than thankful for his help when we had installed my
things and the boat began to move. The river was crowded with flocks
of sailing boats which swirled round us like gulls and there were two
locks to negotiate, but Max seemed to know exactly what to do and at
the same time kept me supplied with important bits of information that
Clive had forgotten to mention, such as keeping to starboard and
giving way to sail.
   <p><quote>How on earth do you know all this?</quote> I asked him.
   <p><quote>I used to play about in these things when I was a kid. And
then I acted as guide on a river boat one summer, to keep myself going
between terms at college.</quote>
   <p>It was the first I had heard of it, but that's one of the things
I like about Max. He has done so many things that there is always
something new and exciting to discover about him.
   <p><quote>You're wonderful,</quote> I said, meaning it.
   <p>He pressed the tip of my nose with one finger. <quote>That makes two
of us.</quote>
   <p>It was about eight o'clock in the evening when we tied up almost
exactly opposite Hardy's garden and went up on to the roof of the
cabin to see what we could see. From this side, Rivermead was less
forbidding; it stood a long way back from the water at the end of a
velvety lawn flanked with flowering trees and shrubs. To the right of
the lawn, close to the water's edge, stood an ancient boathouse
shrouded in wistaria; it was built across a narrow backwater and there
was a delicate iron staircase climbing the outer wall to a room above.
   <p><quote>You won't see anyone tonight, it's too late,</quote> Max said and
turned to go.
   <p><quote>No &mdash; wait,</quote> I put out a hand to stop him. The sun was no
longer shining and it was dark across there by the trees, but I
thought I had seen something move.

<text id=LOBL08>
   <p><quote>Madam, Madam, I beg of you &mdash; you mustn't do that!</quote> Andrea
implored her. <quote>You must help me to go! To &mdash; to beguile a man I
don't love in order to trap him &mdash; it's shameless, horrible! I will
not do it!</quote>
   <p><quote>You will &mdash; because you must!</quote> Madam told her inflexibly. And
then, impatiently: <quote>Heavens, girl, what a to-do! The man is
presentable enough &mdash; and if you marry him, you will get what you want.
You will be Mistress of Galleon House. What more do you want?</quote>
   <p><quote>More &mdash; much more!</quote> Andrea was hardly aware of what she was
saying.
   <p><quote>Love, I suppose?</quote> Madam asked resignedly. <quote>It is the way
with all young people, but it is an illusion &mdash; a mirage. You will do
very well without it. Or who knows, you may fall in love with
Simon.</quote>
   <p><quote>Never!</quote> Andrea declared passionately. <quote>Never! He has
robbed me &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>And here is your chance to make him pay back!</quote> Madam
interrupted. <quote>Now go away and think over what I have said, for it is
the best advice that I or anyone else could give you.</quote>
   <p>She shut her eyes resolutely, and because Andrea knew that it was
purposeless to stay, she went to her own room.
   <p>As Madam's door closed, she opened her eyes and one thin hand
picked nervously at the sheet.
   <p>Had she been wise? Ought she to have hinted at what she knew to
be the truth &mdash; that Simon had fallen in love with the girl at first
sight?
   <p><quote>No!</quote> she said aloud. <quote>I doubt if she would have believed
it! And there is Simon to be considered. With his absurd chivalry,
he will need a little encouragement. And when the child has thought
it over, she will give it. It will all work out as Leo planned &mdash;</quote>
   <p>The tired eyes closed and Madam drifted into the brief, easy
sleep of age.
   <p>
   <p>And Simon, sitting at Leo's desk in the tower room, what did he
feel about it all?
   <p>As Andrea herself had done, he had taken it for granted that Leo
would have left everything to her. His first reaction, when he heard
that he was Leo's heir, was to refuse his inheritance. Not only was
it grossly unfair to Andrea to do anything else, but, if he accepted
it, he was also accepting banishment from his own country and the home
he had known all his life.
   <p>And yet &mdash; and yet &mdash; which was home? That far-off, sun-filled
house with its glorious views of pasture and distant mountains? Or
this grim, sturdy house that was practically a fortress? From the
moment of his arrival it had been as if he had known this place
before. It was like coming home, and yet, before very long, he had
been conscious of a feeling of unreality about it all. But that was
not because of the House. It was the people who lived in it. He
remembered having thought that they were fantastic, people left over
from an earlier age who defied the passing of time. Leo, who should
have been an adventurer. Madam, one of those rare, magnificent woman
who, no matter what their age, have the ability to attract and hold
the devotion and loyalty of men. And Andrea? What was she? A
younger version of Madam? In some ways, perhaps. As far as loyalty
and courage were concerned, without doubt. But as yet unsure of
herself, as Madam, he was convinced, had never been unsure.
   <p>Andrea. It all came back to her. Whatever he decided to do must
serve her best interests. That being so, on the face of it, it would
seem that he must somehow pass his inheritance on to her. But there
was more to it than that. Luke, for one thing. And for another, the
secret of Galleon House which he believed he had all but solved. An
odd word here and there, a look of amusement in Leo's eyes &mdash; the
amusement of a man who has always enjoyed playing with fire. And, now
and again, a sudden feeling of tension in the air.
   <p>There were other things too, some so nebulous as to make them
impossible to grasp, some insignificant in themselves, but adding up,
surely, to give substance to an incredible conviction.
   <p>Yes, convincing to himself but lacking actual proof. And that he
was determined to have before he went to Madam and demanded the truth,
as he fully intended doing.
   <p>Already he knew that he would not find that proof among Leo's
papers. Sitting in this quiet room with an unpleasant feeling of
guilt, he had gone through every cupboard, every drawer, every file.
All dealt with the normal business of the estate. And all were in
apple-pie order. Leo had been a good man of business as well as &mdash;
everything else.
   <p>There was the safe too. That yielded up a certain amount of
jewellery, though none of very great value, a list of Leo's
investments, a statement showing at which bank they were deposited and
various certificates and statements from the same bank. These last
Simon went through carefully. For a good many years past Leo had been
paying in large sums from time to time &mdash; twice or three times a year
at the outside. One had been made very recently, and Simon recognised
it as being approximately the amount that the diamond necklace and
bracelet had fetched. Surely, all clear and above board! And yet he
was not satisfied.
   <p>But for days past he had had the growing conviction that there
was one place where he would find the information he wanted.
   <p>That story, which Leo had confirmed, about the Trevaine treasure
buried beneath the House itself, had always fired his imagination.
His grandfather had told him stories about it that, to his boyish
mind, had held the very essence of romance. And though he had never
mentioned the fact to Leo, he knew where the entry to the hidden
chamber was. What was more, he himself had taken the key on its
slender chain from around his dead cousin's neck and had worn it round
his own neck ever since.
   <p>No one had asked him about it, but he thought Madam knew where it
was since he had made no secret of what he was doing with it and she
had doubtless been told.
   <p>Now he slipped it off and looked at it intently. It was a modern
key, beautifully made and engraved with the name of a famous firm of
safe-makers. That further confirmed his suspicions. His grandfather
had spoken of a massive oak door, studded with steel bosses and
strengthened with steel bars &mdash; strong enough, no doubt, in the days
when it was put there, but evidently not strong enough to please Leo.
Well, he would go and see what it was all about, for only when he
knew the whole story could he decide &mdash;
   <p>He went to his bedroom for an electric torch into which he had
recently put a new battery and made his way to Leo's bedroom &mdash; a room
which, in fact, he could claim for his own now if he wished since it
was always used by the owner of the House. This, however, he had no
desire to do, but at least the fact gave him the feeling that he was
not trespassing. When one generation succeeded another over so many
years as was the case here, some rooms, at least, acquired an almost
impersonal quality.
   <p>It was so here. Presumably Madam had given orders for the room
to be entirely cleared of all of Leo's personal property. It was
simply a bedroom, swept and garnished for its next occupant &mdash; himself.
   <p>Like many of the other rooms in the House, this was panelled. By
one side of the fireplace was a door which looked as if it might lead
to another room. Simon knew better. Carefully locking the door
through which he had just come, he opened the second door and flashed
on his torch. At right angles to the door and in the thickness of the
massive wall a flight of stone steps ran down and at the bottom was a
heavy oak door &mdash; the one his grandfather had told him about. As he
went down, he counted the steps and estimated that they must have
brought him just about to ground level.
   <p>It did not surprise him very much to find that the door opened on
the latch, for it was so old and worn that it offered little security.
Beyond it Simon found more steps which suddenly took a turn, so that
he knew the old story was true; the Trevaine treasure was buried right
under the house itself.
   <p>It did not surprise him to find that now, instead of the walls
and steps being of stone, they were hewn out of solid rock, and then,
at the bottom of the further flight, he found a new door. It was
painted a dull grey, but as Simon laid his hand on it, he knew from
the coldness of it that it was made of steel. He pursed his lips in a
whistle as he flashed the torch over it. Set in the rock itself, it
presented a formidable barrier &mdash; and it must have been no easy task
getting it into place. All the same, it opened easily at the turn of
Leo's key and Simon pushed it open. Eager though he was to get on
with his discoveries, he examined the edge of the thick door and its
interior carefully before letting go of it. He had no wish to take
part in a latter-day Mistletoe Bough story! It looked safe enough to
him to let go of the door, but just in case, he looked round for
something to prop against it so that it could not shut, and then, for
the first time, he realised that he was actually in the treasure
chamber. Neatly ranged against the rock walls were all manner of
chests and trunks. Some were comparatively modern, some, Simon
thought, Captain Jeremy might well have brought home full of plunder.
He found a good, solid metal one that was not too heavy to lift and
set it between the door and its frame. Then he began his search.
   <p>It would have been tempting to investigate the contents of the
chests, but there was something else which intrigued Simon even more
than they did. Sunk right into the rock so that only its door showed
was a modern safe, and a glance showed that it had a combination lock.
   <p>So, after all, he could not find out what he wanted to know
without taking someone into his confidence, he thought wryly. Madam,
presumably, would know the word that unlocked the safe, but the last
thing he wanted to do was ask her for it. Well, at least he could
have a shot &mdash; he did not know much about such locks, but he did know
that you could tell the number of letters in the word by the number of
dials. This was a six-letter word.
   <p>Six letters &mdash; and it might be any word in the world! But it was
worth while trying words which had some connection with Galleon House.
Andrea &mdash; that had the right number of letters, but he quickly found
it was not the right one. Galleon &mdash; no, seven. Trevaine, much too
long. Well, how about &mdash; he looked about himself for inspiration &mdash;
Jeremy &mdash; or pirate? He tried each in turn without success. Feeling
considerably discouraged, he tried other family names. Cherry, Leo's
mother. Esther, his grandfather's sister. Two other surnames
connected with the family &mdash; Penlee and Polwyn &mdash; though with little
hope over the last. Leo, he felt, would hardly use the name of a man
he despised so heartily.
   <p>He thought deeply. What else was there to try? Poldean, on the
other side of the estuary, was too long. So was St. Finbar &mdash;
although Finbar alone &mdash; suddenly he gave a shout of laughter that
echoed oddly in the confined space.

<text id=LOBL09>
She couldn't understand that any woman could resist for a moment
the prospect of an association &mdash; any sort of association &mdash; with the
wonderful, the handsome, the fascinating Connor Winslow.
   <p>And Con? Well, as far as I could judge, Con thought exactly the
same.
   <p>Fatted calf or no fatted calf, Annabel's homecoming would
certainly be a riot.

   <p>Oh, the oak and the ash, and the bonny ivy tree,
   <p>They are all growing so green in the North Country.
<QUOTE/>

   <p>Traditional.
   <p>THE approach to Whitescar was down a narrow gravelled track
edged with hawthorns. There was no gate. On the right of the gap
where the track left the main road, stood a dilapidated signpost which
had once said, Private Road to Forrest Hall. On the left was a
new and solid-looking stand for milk-churns, which bore a
beautifully-painted legend, WHITESCAR. Between these symbols the
lane curled off between its high hawthorns, and out of sight.
   <p>I had come an hour too early, and no one was there to meet the
bus. I had only two cases with me, and carrying these I set off down
the lane.
   <p>Round the first bend there was a quarry, disused now and
overgrown, and here, behind a thicket of brambles, I left my cases.
They would be safe enough, and could be collected later. Meanwhile I
was anxious to make my first reconnaissance alone.
   <p>The lane skirted the quarry, leading downhill for perhaps another
two hundred yards before the hedges gave way on the one side to a high
wall, and on the other &mdash; the left &mdash; to a fence which allowed a view
across the territory that Lisa had been at such pains to picture for
me.
   <p>I stood, leaning on the top bar of the fence, and looked at the
scene below me.
   <p>Whitescar was about eight miles, as the crow flies, from
Bellingham. There the river, meandering down its valley, doubles
round leisurely on itself in a great loop, all but enclosing the
rolling, well-timbered lands of Forrest Park. At the narrow part of
the loop the bends of the river are barely two hundred yards apart,
forming a sort of narrow isthmus through which ran the track on which
I stood. This was the only road to the Hall, and it divided at the
lodge gates for Whitescar and the West Lodge which lay the other side
of the park.
   <p>The main road, along which my bus had come, lay some way above
the level of the river, and the drop past the quarry to the Hall gates
was fairly steep. From where I stood you could see the whole
near-island laid out below you in the circling arm of the river, with
its woods and its water meadows and the chimneys glimpsed among the
green.
   <p>To the east lay Forrest Hall itself, set in what remained of its
once formal gardens and timbered walks, the grounds girdled on two
sides by the curving river, and on two by a mile-long wall and a belt
of thick trees. Except for a wooded path along the river, the only
entrance was through the big pillared gates where the main lodge had
stood. This, I knew, had long since been allowed to crumble gently
into ruin. I couldn't see it from where I was, but the tracks to
Whitescar and West Lodge branched off there, and I could see the
latter clearly, cutting across the park from east to west, between the
orderly rows of planted conifers. At the distant edge of the river, I
caught a glimpse of roofs and chimneys, and the quick glitter of glass
that marked the hot-houses in the old walled garden that had belonged
to the Hall. There, too, lay the stables, and the house called West
Lodge, and a footbridge spanning the river to serve a track which
climbed through the far trees and across the moors to Nether Shields
farm, and, eventually, to Whitescar.
   <p>The Whitescar property, lying along the river-bank at the very
centre of its loops, and stretching back to the junction of the roads
at the Hall gates, was like a healthy bite taken out of the circle of
Forrest territory. Lying neatly between the Hall and West Lodge, it
was screened now from my sight by a rise in the land that only allowed
me to see its chimneys, and the tops of the trees.
   <p>I left my view-point, and went on down the track, not hurrying.
Behind the wall to my right now loomed the Forrest woods, the huge
trees full out, except for the late, lacy boughs of ash. The ditch at
the wall's foot was frilled with cow-parsley. The wall was in poor
repair; I saw a blackbird's nest stuffed into a hole in the coping,
and there were tangles of campion and toad-flax bunching from gaps
between the stones.
   <p>At the Hall entrance, the lane ended in a kind of cul-de-sac,
bounded by three gateways. On the left, a brand-new oak gate guarded
the Forestry Commission's fir plantations and the road to West Lodge.
To the right lay the pillars of the Hall entrance. Ahead was a
solid, five-barred gate, painted white, with the familiar WHITESCAR
blazoning the top bar. Beyond this, the track lifted itself up a
gentle rise of pasture, and vanished over a ridge. From here, not
even the chimney-tops of Whitescar were visible; only the smooth sunny
prospect of green pastures and dry-stone walling sharp with blue
shadows, and, in a hollow beyond the rise somewhere, the tops of some
tall trees.
   <p>But the gateway to the right might have been the entrance to
another sort of world.
   <p>Where the big gates of the Hall should have hung between their
massive pillars, there was simply a gap giving on to a driveway, green
and mossy, its twin tracks no longer worn by wheels, but matted over
by the discs of plaintain  and hawkweed, rings of weed
spreading and overlapping like the rings that grow and ripple over
each other when a handful of gravel is thrown into water. At the
edges of the drive the taller weeds began, hedge-parsley and campion,
and forget-me-not gone wild, all frothing under the ranks of the
rhododendrons, whose flowers showed like pale, symmetrical lamps above
their splayed leaves. Overhead hung the shadowy, enormous trees.
   <p>There had been a lodge once, tucked deep in the trees beside the
gate. A damp, dismal place it must have been to live in; the walls
were almost roofless now, and half drifted over with nettles. The
chimney-stacks stuck up like bones from a broken limb. All that had
survived of the little garden was a rank plantation of rhubarb, and
the old blush rambler that ran riot through the gaping windows.
   <p>There was no legend here of FORREST to guide the visitor.
For those wise in the right lores there were some heraldic beasts on
top of the pillars, rampant, and holding shields where some carving
made cushions under the moss. From the pillars, to either side,
stretched the high wall that had once marked the boundaries. This was
cracked and crumbling in many places, and the copings were off, but it
was still a barrier, save in one place not far from the pillar on the
lodge side of the gate. Here a giant oak stood. It had been
originally on the inside of the wall, but with the years it had grown
and spread, pressing closer and ever closer to the masonry, until its
vast flank had bent and finally broken the wall, which here lay in a
mere pile of tumbled and weedy stone. But the power of the oak would
be its undoing, for the wall had been clothed in ivy, and the ivy had
reached for the tree, crept up it, engulfed it, till now the trunk was
one towering mass of the dark gleaming leaves, and only the tree's
upper branches managed to thrust the young gold leaves of early summer
through the strangling curtain. Eventually the ivy would kill it.
Already, through the tracery of the ivy-stems, some of the oak-boughs
showed dead, and one great lower limb, long since broken off, had left
a gap where rotten wood yawned, in holes deep enough for owls to nest
in.
   <p>I looked up at it for a long time, and then along the neat sunny
track that led out of the shadow of the trees towards Whitescar.
   <p>Somewhere a ring-dove purred and intoned, and a wood-warbler
stuttered into its long trill, and fell silent. I found that I had
moved, without realising it, through the gateway, and a yard or two up
the drive into the wood. I stood there in the shade, looking out at
the wide fields and the cupped valley, and the white-painted gate
gleaming in the sun. I realised that I was braced as if for the start
of a race, my mouth dry, and the muscles of my throat taut and aching.
   <p>I swallowed a couple of times, breathed deeply and slowly to calm
myself, repeating the now often-used formula of what was there to go
wrong, after all? I was Annabel. I was coming home. I had never
been anyone else. All that must be forgotten. Mary Grey need never
appear again, except, perhaps, to Con and Lisa. Meanwhile, I would
forget her, even in my thoughts. I was Annabel Winslow, coming home.
   <p>I walked quickly out between the crumbling pillars, and pushed
open the white gate.
   <p>It didn't even creak. It swung quietly open on sleek, well-oiled
hinges, and came to behind me with a smooth click that said money.
   <p>Well, that was what had brought me, wasn't it?
   <p>I walked quickly out of the shade of the Forrest trees, and up
the sunny track towards Whitescar.
   <p>
   <p>In the bright afternoon stillness the farm looked clean in its
orderly whitewash, like a toy. From the top of the rise I could see
it all laid out, in plan exactly like the maps that Lisa Dermott had
drawn for me so carefully, and led me through in imagination so many
times.
   <p>The house was long and low, two-storied, with big modern windows
cut into the old thick walls. Unlike the rest of the group of
buildings, it was not whitewashed, but built of sandstone, green-gold
with age. The lichens on the roof showed, even at that distance, like
patens of copper laid along the soft blue slates.
   <p>It faced on to a strip of garden &mdash; grass and flower-borders and a
lilac tree &mdash; whose lower wall edged the river. From the garden, a
white wicket-gate gave on a wooden footbridge. The river was fairly
wide here, lying under the low, tree-hung cliffs of its further bank
with that still gleam that means depth. It reflected the bridge, the
trees, and the banked tangles of elder and honeysuckle, in layers of
deepening colour as rich as a Flemish painter's palette.
   <p>On the nearer side of house and garden lay the farm; a
courtyard &mdash; even at this distance I could see its clean baked
concrete, and the freshness of the paint on doors and gates &mdash;
surrounded by byres and stables and sheds, with the red roof of the
big Dutch barn conspicuous beside the remains of last year's straw
stacks, and a dark knot of Scotch pines.
   <p>I had been so absorbed in the picture laid out before me, that I
hadn't noticed the man approaching, some thirty yards away, until the
clang of his nailed boots on the iron of the cattle-grid startled me.
   <p>He was a burly, middle-aged man in rough farm clothes, and he was
staring at me in undisguised interest as he approached. He came at a
pace that, without seeming to, carried him over the distance between
us at a speed that left me no time to think at all.
   <p>I did have time to wonder briefly if my venture alone into the
Winslow den was going to prove my undoing, but at least there was no
possibility now of turning tail.

<text id=LOBL10>
<head>CHAPTER NINE</head>
   <p>The pale April sunshine filtered into the back court of a
Glasgow slum, throwing its soft radiance on grimy windows, blistering
the already ravaged paintwork and casting long shadows across the
broken masonry of the dirty evil-smelling hovels. This was Utah
Street, and Utah Street was a cancerous growth in the flesh of a great
city.
   <p>The sunlight struggled over a thick layer of dirt on a window at
ground level and lightened the interior of a room that was no better
and no worse than the majority of its neighbours. An old-fashioned
range, yellowed by rust, housed the dying embers of a fire that made
the airless kitchen a veritable oven of unpleasant odours. At the
table, littered with a motley collection of articles, ranging from
empty beer bottles to discarded articles of clothing, sat the man
known only by the appellation of Gaffer. Among this wreckage of human
society, Gaffer was probably the most defeated of all the wretched
inhabitants who called Utah Street <quote>home</quote>. Gaffer was an alien in
their midst, but the ways of a bully soon make their mark and he
swiftly earned a reputation for himself as a man who could defend his
chosen way of life. In five short years he was not only accepted but
had become a leading light in a rapidly dying empire of squalor and
decay.
   <p>Gaffer bent his head over the newspaper bearing the day's racing
forecast, oblivious of the sun, the advent of spring and the murmur of
voices from the pontoon school in the corner of the yard. His
forefinger travelled slowly down the list of probable starters for the
three-thirty at Newmarket. Thoughtfully he tapped his teeth with a
pencil as he deliberated over the rival merits of the two horses of
his choice. Nothing in it as regards the starting prices. It was
simply a matter of choosing the right horse. He smiled to himself as
he fingered the five one-pound notes lying before him on the table. A
couple of good winners today and he could live it up for a week or so.
Might even go away for a couple of days. Reaching for the Form Book
he thumbed through its battered pages in search of the information he
required. When he had made his choice he rose and strode to the door.
He crossed the narrow close and planted a savage foot on the panel of
the opposite door. A small shrivelled creature craned a startled head
round the jamb, the cadaverous features creased into a nervous smirk.
   <p><quote>A'right, Gaffer. I'm coming.</quote> He jerked on his threadbare
jacket and shuffled after the other back to the stuffy humidity of the
kitchen. <quote>You wantin' somethin', Gaffer?</quote>
   <p><quote>You don't think I enjoy your scintillating company, do you?</quote>
Gaffer scribbled on a slip of paper and tucked the banknotes into its
fold. <quote>Nip round to Sammy and give him this. Wait until the race is
over.</quote> A slow grin revealed his perfect teeth. <quote>I'm expecting
thirty quid back.</quote>
   <p><quote>You floppin' five quid on one horse?</quote>
   <p><quote>What's that got to do with you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothin', Gaffer, nothin'. I just thought it's a bit risky,
that's a'.</quote>
   <p><quote>And who asked you to do the thinking around here?</quote> Gaffer's
lip curled in disgust. <quote>Go on, beat it, and if you get nicked, I'll
paper the walls with you.</quote>
   <p>Glad to make his escape Lofty scuttled off down the close,
grateful that the other was in such a mellow mood. Less than forty
minutes later he returned bearing in a shaking hand thirty one-pound
notes. Goggle-eyed, he watched Gaffer count his winnings. He
separated three from the pile and contemptuously threw them on the
floor. <quote>Go on, buy yourself a Rolls-Royce,</quote> he sneered. A jerk of
his head signalled dismissal. <quote>Don't go away. I might want you
later on.</quote> <quote>Sure, Gaffer. I'll be next door.</quote>
   <p>Gaffer returned to his study of his newspaper. This was his day.
He could feel it. Swiftly he scanned the sheet for the greyhound
runners. Yes, he was sure Dosser had said he was running The Slob
tonight. Tentatively, he fingered his winnings. Should he risk it
all in one fell swoop? Yes, he decided at last, why not, it was time
he had a run of luck in any case. He rose and moved to the broken
triangle of mirror hanging above the sink. He studied his image with
petulant concentration. Always a victim of his over-developed
imagination he thought himself a luckless individual for whom nothing
ever went right. He possessed a persecution complex that frequently
reduced him to a maudlin hulk of self-pity whenever opposition reared
its ugly head, but Gaffer, the supreme egotist, saw none of this as he
examined the face looking back at him through that distorted glass.
Spruced up and clean-shaven, he wasn't a bad-looking man, he decided.
His jawline was firm and there was no surplus flesh gathering on his
tall frame. The mouth curled sardonically as he smoothed back his
thick dark hair revealing again a glimpse of his teeth, strong and
white as blanched almonds. He drew in a deep breath and was on the
point of turning back to his newspaper when his eye fell on an
out-of-date magazine lying on the floor. A photograph taken at a
recent film premi&egrave;re held his attention. Slowly he stooped
to lift the magazine and an idea began to ferment in his quick brain.
An idea so daring and yet so audaciously tempting that a shiver of
excitement quivered through him. He studied the photograph for a long
time before throwing aside the book and returning to his study of the
racing column, but this time his concentration was fired by the flame
of incentive.
   <p>A sharp rap on the door brought a frown of impatience to his face
and with a low growl he gave permission to enter. The panel swung
open to admit a narrow-shouldered man in a black su&egrave;de zipper
jerkin and tight Italian trousers.
   <p><quote>'Lo Gaffer. Heard you'd a bit of luck on the three-thirty.
Want a certainty for the dogs tonight?</quote> <quote>Such as?</quote> sneered
Gaffer.
   <p><quote>Hurly Burly. That dog's jet propelled.</quote> Cuddy Gallagher
winked. <quote>Over'n above that, I happen to know he's been got at by
the boys.</quote>
   <p>Gaffer's eyes narrowed. <quote>That a sure thing?</quote>
   <p><quote>Sure as death.</quote> Cuddy's sleek head jerked in the direction
of the table. <quote>Want me to lay some of that lot on for you?</quote>
   <p>Gaffer lifted the money and slipped two notes into his pocket.
<quote>There's twenty-five quid there. Lose it and I'll kill you. I'll
be at Joe's place tonight but don't let anyone see you flash my money
around.</quote>
   <p>Cuddy peeled off five notes before stowing the remainder away.
<quote>Commission,</quote> he laconically explained. <quote>Well, I'm away. See
you later.</quote>
   <p><quote>Tell The Wop I want to see him.</quote>
   <p><quote>I havenae time to look for that wee greaser,</quote> Cuddy
objected. <quote>If you want this lot on in time it'll need to be done
right away. Sent Lofty to do your dirty work.</quote>
   <p><quote>Look,</quote> a dangerous glint appeared in Gaffer's bright eyes,
<quote>I'll decide who does what. You get that money on first then look
for The Wop. Tonight I'm going to clean up so you'd better warn Sammy
to keep plenty of the ready by him. I want a hundred nicker off him
before I'm finished.</quote>
   <p>Cuddy emitted a low soundless whistle. <quote>That's a lot of
change.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, but I'll get it.</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll be lucky.</quote>
   <p><quote>You bet I am. I'm on the right streak tonight, I can feel
it.</quote>
   <p>Cuddy saw the look of fanaticism on the other's face. He did not
recognize it as such, but it was sufficient to tell him that this was
not the moment to argue. <quote>O.K., so you're lucky,</quote> he swiftly
placated. <quote>Have it your own way.</quote>
   <p>Gaffer lifted the half-empty whisky bottle from the sink-board
and sloshed a liberal quantity into a tumbler. <quote>Here's to your
information being correct, Cuddy, because if it isn't...</quote> His arm
flashed out and grabbed hold of a handful of su&egrave;de jacket, <quote>you'd
better not show your face back here, unless you want me to work on it
with a razor.</quote>
   <p>Hate rose in Cuddy like mercury in a thermometer but fear stifled
his reply as the grip on his throat tightened. <quote>Listen, Gaffer,</quote>
he whispered in desperation, <quote>even if that dog wins, you'll no' get a
hundred quid back.</quote> He swallowed with difficulty. <quote>It's only
runnin' at even money.</quote>
   <p><quote>When you get the winnings, put it on The Slob in the
eight-fifteen.</quote>
   <p><quote>What, all of it?</quote>
   <p><quote>All of it.</quote> Gaffer threw him away and wiped his hand on the
seat of his trousers. <quote>If Sammy runs out of cash lay the second bet
with Kruger. Now get out of my sight before I...</quote> He grinned as he
realized he was talking to himself. He was well aware of the fact
that he was taking a chance in giving Cuddy a free hand with so much
at stake, but he was fairly confident of his hold over the
craven-hearted little tout. Some thirty minutes later he was still
avidly studying the photograph that seemed to fascinate him, when
Louie Morri sidled into the room. It did not take Gaffer long to
explain what he wanted the Italian to do. <quote>Well,</quote> he concluded,
<quote>what about it? Can you do it?</quote>
   <p>Louis looked worried. <quote>Sure, I think so, Gaffer, but it'sa
no' easy.</quote> His big dark eyes swivelled upwards uneasily.
<quote>It'sa goin' to costa lota money, Gaffer. I needa special stuffa
from up-town an' it'sa no' easy to geta.</quote> His podgy hands turned
palm upwards. <quote>You see how it is. It'sa no' easy.</quote>
   <p><quote>If you say that once more, I'll ram your teeth down your
throat.</quote> Gaffer leaned menacingly nearer. <quote>Now listen, Wop, and
listen well. You're going to do this job for me without any more
argument. If you do it right, you'll get paid right. If not, then
I'm afraid I'll have to get rough.</quote> His breath fanned the little
man's face. <quote>You wouldn't like that, Louie. Maria wouldn't like it
either, so you'd better find out a nice easy way of doing it or you're
liable to be up to your fat neck in trouble, Louie boy.</quote>
   <p>Stark fear turned the Italian's skin yellow. <quote>I do it. I do
it. No' to worry, Gaffer, I do it.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's better. I don't like when people argue, Louie. You
ought to know that by this time.</quote> He swung round on the ball of his
foot as the other winced and moved out of range. He smiled. <quote>It's
all right, Louie, I'm not going to hurt you... yet. I don't think I
have to tell you to keep your mouth shut, do I? One cheep out of you
and Maria will be putting down an instalment on a nice marble
headstone. You understand, Louie.</quote>
   <p>Louie's head rocked back and forward like a hinged flap.
<quote>It'sa a'right, Gaffer. I no' open my moutha.</quote>
   <p><quote>I wouldn't, Louie, not if I were you,</quote> Gaffer advised.
<quote>Just you keep thinking that way and everything will be all
right.</quote> He escorted his nervous visitor to the door. <quote>You go back
to the shop and I'll send Cuddy down when he comes in. You can make
out a list of the stuff you need and I'll get it for you. How long
would it take?</quote>
   <p>Louie thought carefully. <quote>No' very longa. A couple of weeks
I think.</quote>
   <p><quote>O.K. See you later.</quote> His finger poked belligerently in
the other's face. <quote>Now, remember, keep your mouth shut about this,
or...</quote> He made an expressive gesture with his forefinger.
   <p><quote>I keep my moutha shut,</quote> Louie promised fervently.
<head>CHAPTER TEN</head>
   <p>MARK'S feet made no sound on the smooth turf as he walked
slowly towards the chestnut tree. Christiane was sitting with her
back to him, her fair head bent over a book. He stood motionless for
a moment, watching her, his look gravely compassionate as he noted the
rug draped over her legs.

<text id=LOBL11>
   <p><quote>Yes, quite.</quote>
   <p>Maureen, afraid he might think she had asked too many questions,
said nothing for several minutes. They had turned the bend in the
road and were walking along with Loch Eighe on their left.
   <p><quote>There's a road on the other side,</quote> MacLeod said.
   <p><quote>Have you been about at all since you've been here?</quote>
   <p><quote>A few miles yesterday &mdash; to Dalloch and round that way, that's
all. Is there a ferry across the loch?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not for cars. It only goes when it's wanted. I shouldn't
think that's very often.</quote> He pointed to the far shore of the loch
where it met Loch Onaig. <quote>That's the ferryman's house there.</quote>
   <p>Maureen was just able to make out a croft.
   <p><quote>Can we go across some time?</quote> she asked. <quote>I love ferries.</quote>
   <p><quote>If you'd like to.</quote>
   <p><quote>Please.</quote> Rather diffidently she added, <quote>I'm sorry, perhaps
you'd rather ...</quote>
   <p><quote>I'd like to,</quote> MacLeod assured her. <quote>The shore's rather fine
along there, there are a lot of birches and bracken.</quote>
   <p>They walked a little farther, then he said, <quote>We'd better turn
back if we're going to have that drink. And you'll be getting
cold.</quote>
   <p>As they retraced their steps he wondered what Maureen's fianc&eacute;
had been like. He had been a policeman too long to judge people too
swiftly but he would have thought most men would have been more than
happy to marry the girl beside him. Perhaps it had really been her
who had broken off the engagement.
   <p>They reached the jetty. Maureen crossed the yard or two of grass
and stood on the beach, looking up Loch Onaig to the mountains rising
round its head. MacLeod joined her.
   <p><quote>Isn't it lovely?</quote> she said. <quote>I feel I never want to go
back.</quote>
   <p><quote>An hour ago you were telling me you should never have come.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. I don't feel like that any more.</quote>
   <p>She picked up a stone and tossed it into the water. It fell with
a dull plop and they watched the ripples spreading.
   <p><quote>How did you come?</quote> she asked.
   <p><quote>Train.</quote>
   <p>She turned and walked back to the road. MacLeod followed her.
   <p>They talked little on the way back to the hotel, walking slowly,
each thinking. Arrived there, Maureen went up to her room while
MacLeod entered the bar. Since his last stay there Alan had had it
redecorated to suit the taste of his English patrons. The couple who
had arrived that afternoon were sitting on a low couch against one
wall. The contemporary furnishings seemed a more appropriate setting
for them than the bright sunlight and sparser surroundings of the
dining-room.
   <p>The only other occupant apart from the barman, James, was a
shortish, slightly-built man of about MacLeod's age. He had rather
small eyes and thinning fair hair and he was wearing a tweed sports
jacket that somehow did not look quite right on him. He was leaning
against the end of the bar and when MacLeod came up to it he eyed him
as a man will in such circumstances when he had nothing better to do.
   <p><quote>A gin and lime and an Export, please, James,</quote> MacLeod said.
   <p>Still eyeing him the other man asked, <quote>Is Mr. Ferguson in,
James?</quote>
   <p>The barman, busy with MacLeod's order, answered over his
shoulder.
   <p><quote>No, Mr. Martin, he's out just now.</quote>
   <p>Martin, MacLeod reflected. He had heard that name somewhere
recently. But where? In what connection? Moreover, something about
the man seemed vaguely familiar though he could not remember seeing
him before. Probably it was nothing more than a chance resemblance to
someone else.
   <p><quote>It's been a grand day again,</quote> he remarked.
   <p><quote>Damned hot,</quote> Martin agreed. MacLeod thought he looked
worried.
   <p><quote>It was hot in the glen this morning,</quote> he said.
   <p>Martin looked sideways at him.
   <p><quote>You were there this morning?</quote> he demanded.
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>Did you go far?</quote>
   <p>The barman put two glasses down on the counter. MacLeod paid
him. Martin, he felt, was waiting impatiently for his answer.
   <p><quote>Nearly to the top,</quote> he replied lightly. <quote>Why?</quote>
   <p>The other did not answer at once.
   <p><quote>There are some birds up there,</quote> he explained after a moment.
<quote>I've been hoping no-one would disturb them.</quote>
   <p><quote>What sort of birds?</quote> MacLeod asked curiously.
   <p><quote>Capercaillies.</quote>
   <p>The barman looked surprised.
   <p><quote>In Glen Onaig, Mr. Martin?</quote> he enquired. <quote>I've been here
all my life and I've never known any round here before.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, they're here now,</quote> Martin said shortly.
   <p>MacLeod eyed him.
   <p><quote>They're those big birds with a piercing cry, aren't they?</quote> he
asked.
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> Martin agreed without much grace.
   <p>Out of the corner of his eye MacLeod noticed that James looked
surprised.
   <p><quote>I promise I won't scare them,</quote> he said. <quote>I don't suppose I
shall go up the glen again while I'm here.</quote>
   <p>Martin looked relieved.
   <p><quote>It's just the top part beyond the fall,</quote> he explained.
   <p><quote>So many rare birds are driven away nowadays.</quote>
   <p><quote>Like the ospreys?</quote> MacLeod suggested.
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p>Over Martin's shoulder he saw Maureen come in. The woman sitting
on the couch glanced up and eyed her with an almost insolent
condescension as she crossed to join him.
   <p><quote>Will you ask Mr. Ferguson to give me a ring when he comes
in?</quote> Martin asked James.
   <p><quote>Ay, I will, Mr. Martin.</quote>
   <p>With a curt nod to MacLeod the other went out.
   <p>Maureen picked up her glass.
   <p><quote>Good luck,</quote> she said. <quote>Shall we sit down?</quote>
   <p>MacLeod dragged his thought back from the wild idea that had been
forming in his mind.
   <p><quote>Yes, of course,</quote> he agreed.
   <p><quote>Had something happened before I came in?</quote> Maureen asked when
they were seated on the second of the two couches.
   <p><quote>No. Why?</quote>
   <p><quote>I thought there was a bit of an atmosphere.</quote>
   <p><quote>We were talking about capercaillies.</quote>
   <p><quote>What on earth are they?</quote>
   <p><quote>Large birds found in the Highlands.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh.</quote>
   <p>When they had finished their drinks MacLeod asked, <quote>Will you
have another one?</quote>
   <p><quote>On condition you'll let me pay.</quote>
   <p><quote>Certainly not.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then no, thank you.</quote>
   <p>Maureen smiled sweetly.
   <p><quote>Look here,</quote> he began.
   <p><quote>Please.</quote>
   <p>She looked so serious that he smiled.
   <p><quote>All right,</quote> he agreed. <quote>If you really mean you'd rather.</quote>
   <p><quote>I do.</quote>
   <p>He crossed to the bar. While James was pouring the drinks he
asked him, <quote>Was that the Mr. Martin who's taken the Lodge?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, that was him.</quote>
   <p><quote>Mr. Ferguson said something about him being a
bird-watcher.</quote>
   <p><quote>He talks a great deal about them,</quote> James assented, managing
to convey an impression of fine contempt.
   <p>He put the glasses down on the bar.
   <p><quote>Do you know where he comes from?</quote> MacLeod asked.
   <p><quote>No, I do not. It is somewhere down south, I'd be thinking.</quote>
   <p><quote>I've a feeling I've seen him somewhere before.</quote>
   <p><quote>Mr. Ferguson might be able to tell you,</quote> James volunteered.
<quote>He knows him well.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll have to ask him. What do the people here think of
Martin?</quote>
   <p><quote>Och, it's little enough they've seen of him. He's not been
here more than a few days altogether. They don't mind him, he's a
harmless enough wee man.</quote>
   <p><quote>Which might be perfectly true,</quote> MacLeod reflected. On the
other hand...
   <p>As he turned away Alan Ferguson came through the door behind the
bar.
   <p><quote>Did you have a good walk this morning?</quote> he enquired.
   <p><quote>Ay, it's been a grand day again.</quote>
   <p>Alan grinned broadly.
   <p><quote>Man, you belong up here!</quote> he exclaimed. <quote>You've been back
twenty-four hours and already you're forgetting your heathen English
speech.</quote>
   <p>MacLeod, grinning and not displeased returned to Maureen.
   <p><quote>Mr. Martin was in just now,</quote> the barman told Alan. <quote>He
seemed kind of nervy. He wants you to phone him.</quote>
   <p>Alan stiffened slightly.
   <p><quote>What the devil does he want?</quote> he muttered.
   <p>MacLeod, hearing him, wondered if Martin was a nuisance.
Certainly Alan did not look pleased.
<head>6</head>
   <p>During the night the weather broke. When MacLeod looked out of
the window the next morning he found that it was drizzling steadily.
Dark grey clouds hung low over the loch and the hills on the other
shore.
   <p>It would probably last until the evening, he thought as he
shaved. Even if it did not there was little hope of its clearing
before the afternoon. Oh well, he would be happy enough in the lounge
with a novel.
   <p>He took his time over dressing and when he entered the
dining-room it was empty. He had almost finished breakfast when
Maureen came in. She was wearing a white raincoat belted tightly
round her waist. A scarf was tied round her head but the rebellious
curl had escaped and hung damply over her left eye. She pushed it
back.
   <p><quote>It's pouring,</quote> she announced, perching on the edge of the
chair facing him.
   <p><quote>I know.</quote>
   <p><quote>I hadn't anything to read and I finished all the Scottish
Fields in the lounge on Sunday so I went to buy a paper.</quote> She
pulled it out of her pocket and laid it on the table. <quote>It's
yesterday's.</quote>
   <p><quote>It would be,</quote> he agreed.
   <p><quote>Yes, I suppose so. I hadn't thought.</quote> She watched him
eating for a moment. <quote>I wondered if we might take the car and find
somewhere where it's drier.</quote>
   <p>He looked at her. For a moment she met his eye, then, flushing
very slightly, she looked down at the table.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry. Perhaps you'd rather stay here.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, it sounds a good idea.</quote>
   <p><quote>You want to go?</quote> There was no mistaking the pleasure in her
voice and MacLeod felt suddenly cheered. Perhaps after all he had not
been really looking forward to spending the morning cooped up in the
lounge. <quote>I don't like staying in when I'm on holiday,</quote> she said
with a hint of defiance. <quote>It seems such a waste.</quote>
   <p><quote>Shall we take lunch or eat in style?</quote>
   <p><quote>In style, I should think.</quote> She smiled. <quote>We might not be
lucky and it's only a Morris Minor, there's not all that much room.</quote>
   <p><quote>There's something I want to do before we go,</quote> MacLeod told
her. <quote>Will twenty minutes be all right for you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Fine.</quote>
   <p>She stood up. He watched her walk to the door, her slim figure
moving gracefully between the tables.
   <p>When he had finished his coffee he went in search of Alan
Ferguson. He found him in his office dealing with the day's
correspondence. When MacLeod appeared in the doorway he was frowning
over a letter. Suddenly he swore and stuffed it into a pocket of his
jacket. Then he saw the other and grinned.
   <p><quote>You're not thinking of walking up the glen this morning?</quote> he
enquired. <quote>The path will be more like a river.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, I'm going for a drive.</quote>
   <p><quote>A drive?</quote> Alan stared.
   <p><quote>With Miss Forrester.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, are you now? Ah well, you'll not be seeing the sun here
today.</quote>
   <p><quote>I was wondering if you've a book on birds I could borrow,</quote>
MacLeod explained.
   <p><quote>Birds? Ay, I believe there is one somewhere about.</quote>
   <p>Alan rose to his feet.
   <p><quote>I was talking to Martin last night and there was something he
mentioned I wanted to look up.</quote>
   <p>The other stopped.
   <p><quote>You were talking to him about birds?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>Yes. He said there were capercaillies in the glen.</quote>
   <p><quote>He may be right at that.</quote>
   <p>They climbed the back stairs to Alan's quarters. He had a
bedroom and a small sitting-room at the end of the building. While
MacLeod stood at the door of the latter Alan looked through the scanty
collection of books on his shelves.
   <p><quote>It's not here,</quote> he announced. <quote>I maybe lent it to someone
and they haven't returned it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Thanks, anyway,</quote> MacLeod said.
   <p>He made his way to his own room and collected the things he
wanted to take with him, his camera, a cap he wore only on holiday and
then only when it rained and a pair of powerful binoculars he had
bought second-hand years before.
   <p>Maureen was waiting for him in the hall. Her car was already
outside the door.
   <p><quote>You'd rather drive,</quote> she said.
   <p><quote>Wouldn't you?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote> She shook her head and walked round to the other side.
   <p>He drove down the road, only to pull up outside the post office.
Maureen looked at him enquiringly.
   <p><quote>Do you mind waiting?</quote> he asked. <quote>I won't be a minute.</quote>

<text id=LOBL12>
Through a mist of tears she went on smiling &mdash; the most wonderful
smile I'd ever seen.
   <p>She whispered, <quote>Oh, my dear, my dear...</quote> Then she offered me
her mouth in complete surrender.
   <p>Maybe she thought she could trust me. Maybe she didn't care.
   <p>As always, I had to fight the temptation to take what she
willingly offered. And it was a lost battle from the start. When she
murmured against my lips, ~<quote>Hold me tight... don't ever leave
me...</quote> I could fight no longer.
   <p>Her body was soft and yielding, her tender hands drew me down
into forgetfulness. Soon she quickened under my caresses as though
the touch of my hands brought to life something that had lain dormant
with her until this moment. When I unfastened her coat, she shrugged
it off with fierce impatience and then her lips sought mine again.
   <p>All around us people slept. Outside in the windy darkness snow
blanketed the sound of distant traffic. Our world belonged to Sonia
and me &mdash; a world created for us alone out of suffering and loneliness
and heartbreak.
   <p>Dimly I wondered if this night would spoil all the other nights
yet to come. She wasn't just another woman. We'd get married... and
have kids... and live like other folks.
   <p>A voice in my head began whining: <quote>...You're trying to
reassure yourself because you know all this has happened before. What
kind of mother will she make, anyway? She's told you herself what she
used to be...</quote>
   <p>I called myself a louse. Swell husband I'd make! She trusted
me no matter what I'd been... and I was eaten up with hatred for all
the other men she'd given herself to. Maybe to her I was no
different...
   <p>But to-night was mine. To-night would wipe the slate clean.
To-morrow, Sonia and I would be just two people who'd met and fallen
in love.
   <p>I reached out and switched off the light. Then I picked her up
and carried her into the bedroom.
   <p>Her skin was smooth and cool as velvet, her hunger as great as
mine. With a little crooning sound in her throat she drew me close to
her.
   <p>Once, she roused and asked in a sleepy whisper, <quote>Do you love
me &mdash; really love me?</quote>
   <p>I said, <quote>Sure, honey. Sure I love you.</quote>
   <p>I meant it, too. But another man lay on the bed beside us. I
could hear his sneering laughter as her arms carried me off through
the fire of oblivion. I can hear it yet.
   <p>
   <p>Picking up a cab wasn't easy. But we got one at last.
   <p>She kissed me good night before she climbed in &mdash; a kiss that was
just the barest touch of her lips. Her eyes were like stars. I've
never known anyone quite as beautiful as Sonia Rakosi.
   <p>When the cab was out of sight in the swirling snow I walked back
to my rooming house and went upstairs with my head filled with
conflicting thoughts. Maybe I was too old to fall in love. Maybe
that was why I had a pain in my mind that wouldn't let me decide
whether I was happy or sad.
   <p>As I opened the door I could smell her perfume. In the bedroom
there was the scent of the powder she'd used when I left her alone to
make up her face and tidy her hair.
   <p>Thinking only made me more confused. So I had a small drink and
then I plugged in the coffee percolator. While it was warming up I
began remaking the bed.
   <p>Bitter-sweet thoughts kept me company. Behind them loomed a
shadowy picture of Jakob Kadar, his lumpy face dark with suspicion.
   <p>Everything pointed to him. Someone in the organisation was a
traitor. That fitted the circumstances better than the idea that Zuck
had been followed the day he ordered a music-box from a store on Fifth
Avenue.
   <p>There was nothing against the theory that he had been followed,
but it had been done by somebody who knew his normal daily routine,
somebody who'd only been waiting for the right moment. If it had not
been the music-box, it would've been something else.
   <p>Kadar had had the opportunity. Kadar was the one member who'd
left the meeting just before ten o'clock. Yet... he could've had no
hand in the switching of the valises. That was the last thing he'd
have wanted to happen.
   <p>So it had been chance that saved the organisation. If Rickie
Oppenheimer hadn't picked up the wrong valise...
   <p>But Rickie shouldn't have been carrying a brief-case that
morning. Every other time he'd left it in the office at the Blue
Bottle Club. Monday night he'd broken a long-standing habit.
   <p>When he'd got no reply at Schultz's apartment he'd gone away.
Some time between then and eight-thirty next morning he'd disposed of
twenty thousand dollars. The question was &mdash; how?
   <p>Zuck hadn't been lying. There had been no money in the
substitute valise. Which meant that Rickie had given it to someone.
And he'd seen only one person that night so far as I knew &mdash; Paula.
But why give it to her?
   <p>I'd finished making the bed by then. As I pushed it back against
the wall I heard something drop on the floor.
   <p>That was when the percolator in the living-room started making
bubbling noises. There was nothing on the floor that I could see. I
told myself it must've fallen down between the bed and the wall.
   <p>...Wasn't urgent anyway. Maybe my cigarette-case... or Sonia's
powder compact... I'd look for it later.
   <p>So I got up from my hands and knees, went into the living-room
and fixed myself a cup of coffee. While I was drinking it I wondered
what Peter Rakosi would say when I told him I wanted to marry his
daughter.
   <p>Did he know the life she'd lived in Budapest &mdash; or was I the only
person in whom she'd ever confided? What difference did it make? She
wasn't that kind of a woman, now. The past was dead. Why did I have
to go on tormenting myself? If only I could learn to accept, it would
be easy...
   <p>There I had a new thought that drove everything else from my
mind. It couldn't have been my cigarette-case that had fallen on the
floor. I had it in my pocket. And Sonia had used her powder compact
just before she left. I remembered seeing her open it and glance in
the mirror for a moment or two before we went out.
   <p>On stiff, unwilling legs I walked back into the bedroom and got
down again on my hands and knees. By the light of a match I saw the
thing that had fallen under the bed.
   <p>It was a small metal box, maybe six inches by four and an inch
and a half deep &mdash; the kind of box that a well-known maker used for
packaging pipe tobacco. They advertised it on television and in all
the glossy magazines.
   <p>Every muscle in my body froze so that I couldn't move. I'd never
had a box like that: I wasn't a pipe smoker. Neither was anyone who'd
visited with me in weeks. And it hadn't been in or on my bed that
morning.
   <p>Sheer blind terror held me rigid as if I'd been stricken with
paralysis. All I could think of was a newspaper report. <quote>...One
arm blown off... his head and the whole of the upper part of his body
a shambles... he had no face...</quote>
   <p>The same kind of death had been planned for me. Any moment
that innocent-looking tobacco box was due to go off. Even as I stared
at it with my skin crawling it was counting off my last moments.
   <p>Judging from the spot where it lay it had been planted between
the underside of the mattress and one of the cross-supports. If I
hadn't re-made the bed... if Sonia and I hadn't made love...
   <p>Sonia. Nothing else accounted for the presence of that hellish
box. I'd left her alone in the bedroom when we awoke from the brief
sleep of exhaustion.
   <p>...She'd given herself to me... then she'd asked me to leave her
so that she could dress and fix her hair. While I was in the
living-room she'd had time to plant the booby-trap...
   <p>That's how it had to be. Behind all the kissing and caressing
she'd been planning my death. I'd become a menace that had to be
removed. So she had appointed herself my executioner.
   <p>Then the match went out. I could still see the small metal box
under the bed. If I'd had the power of movement I could've reached
out and touched it. But I'd lost the will to do anything but kneel
there and sweat, my bones like rubber, my wits gyrating like a
carousel inside my head.
   <p>...If I got up and ran people would be burned to death in their
sleep when the thing went off... The old building would blaze like
tinder. Maybe I'd have time to rouse everybody and get them out
before it was too late... but not if they put up an argument, not if
they refused to believe me and demanded explanations...
   <p>How long would it be before the bomb detonated? My watch said
the time was a few minutes off midnight. Whoever had set the fuse
would have had to allow for the possibility that I might come home
late.
   <p>So much depended on how long Sonia Rakosi had waited for me to
return. She hadn't been in any hurry to leave.
   <p>So there must've been an ample time allowance. Probably it was
meant to explode at three or four o'clock in the morning when they
could be sure I was in bed and asleep.
   <p>But there was always the chance that I was wrong. Any way I
looked at it I had to take that chance.
   <p>With sweat on my hands I groped under the bed and took hold of
the metal box. Slowly and stiffly I stood up and walked into the
living-room. I've never been so scared in all my life.
   <p>Putting on my coat meant transferring the box from one hand to
the other. I wondered stupidly what would happen if I dropped it.
Maybe nothing. Maybe it didn't matter. If I'd miscalculated nothing
mattered.
   <p>I left the light on and went out and down the stairs, the box
held in both hands. Outside it was blowing a blizzard. I had to
watch where I put my feet in case I fell. I had to force myself to
think. The one thing I knew with absolute certainty was that I had to
keep going.
   <p>The streets were empty. Snow blanketed everything beyond a few
yards ahead. With the metal box hugged against my chest I went on.
   <p>My hands became numbed with cold and I had only a vague idea
where I was. Somewhere a clock struck the hour. By then I was in a
daze. Time no longer counted, time existed only inside the thing I
carried.
   <p>Above the noise of the wind I thought I could hear the ticking of
a clock. It grew louder and louder with every step I took.
<head>CHAPTER 12</head>
   <p>EVEN NOW I don't know where I thought I was going or what I
meant to do when I got there. All I remember is walking on and on,
seeking a place where I could rid myself of the metal box &mdash; a place
that I knew only too well I might never reach.
   <p>To leave the time bomb lying in the street was one thing I
couldn't do. It had been created for me. No one else must die
because I'd been a fool. No innocent passer-by must pay the price of
my stupidity.
   <p>So I walked on in my own private hell, listening to the ticking
noise that I knew was inside my head, cringing in my stomach from the
holocaust that the metal box might unleash at any moment.

<text id=LOBL13>
   <p><quote>One thing I forgot, sir. About what they told Murray at the
pub. The only other inhabitant's a girl. A niece, she's thought to
be.</quote>
   <p><quote>Miss Kipper, in fact?</quote>
   <p><quote>That may well be, sir.</quote>
   <p><quote>Splendid. This affair is going to offer one sheerly aesthetic
moment, at least. I look forward to it.</quote>
   <p>And Appleby walked on.
   <p>
   <p>The drive was completely untended. It passed between ragged
shrubberies and skirted a garden which was a wilderness. But even
this hardly prepared one for the spectacle that the house itself
presented on a closer view. It stood, as it were, knee-deep in
weeds &mdash; like some forlorn prehistoric creature in an inedible pasture.
Its grey surfaces were flaked and cracked; its woodwork was denuded
of paint; many of the lower windows showed tattered curtains pulled
awry, and some of the upper ones lacked entire panes of glass. The
effect was the more shocking because the house carried its breeding on
its ruined face. If challenged to date it, Appleby would have said
1718; if challenged to name the builder, he would have said James
Gibbs. But now it spoke either of madness &mdash; which, indeed, was what
was attributed to its owner &mdash; or of penury. Perhaps it spoke of both.
Appleby found himself wondering how the false Astarte had risen to a
decent coat and skirt when she had presented herself to Gulliver and
Heffer on that fateful occasion. For this was Astarte's home.
Mysteriously, but finally, Appleby hadn't the slightest doubt of it.
   <p>He glanced at Heffer's car. It told him that Heffer was either a
man of unassuming tastes or possessed of only a very modest private
income indeed. He glanced at the other car, which Parker had supposed
to be a doctor's. There was a brief-case on the back seat &mdash; and,
neatly stacked beside it, a sheaf of documents tied with narrow pink
tape. Not a doctor, then. A solicitor. This discovery was a relief.
   <p>Appleby mounted half a dozen steps to the front door. As he did
so, he recalled Sir Gabriel Gulliver's guess at Astarte Oakes's
background: the ponies and the spaniels in decay, and a garden boy
beginning to feel entitled to a rise in wages. Genteel poverty among
the descendants of a Colonial Governor. Well, that looked as if it
had been a near miss. The poverty was here, all right. But it didn't
seem as if there were a garden boy. Appleby rang the bell.
   <p>Or, rather, he went through the motion of doing this. But the
bell-pull went limp in his hand. It might have been the limb of an
infant corpse &mdash; he suddenly and ghoulishly thought &mdash; before rigor
mortis set in. Then he remembered a story of a man who had pulled
at a broken bell like this so vigorously that yards of wire had shot
out and strangled him. Veere House, he decided, didn't conduce to a
healthy state of mind. He clenched his fist and knocked vigorously on
the door. After a pause, he knocked again. There was every reason to
suppose that the effect in the interior must be considerable. But
nothing happened. Perhaps he ought to begin shouting an injunction to
open in the name of the law. But that was more in Parker's line. He
tried the door and found that it wasn't locked. So he opened it and
walked in. Trespass, perhaps. But not house-breaking or burglary.
   <p>He was confirmed at once in his impression that here had been a
dwelling of some elegance. In front of him was a circular hall of
moderate dimensions, rising to a cupola and lantern, and clothed in a
plain honeycoloured marble which was relieved by engaged pilasters in
the same stone. Ahead was an archway beyond which a branching
staircase rose beneath a second cupola. On either side were open
doorways, giving on large rooms.
   <p>The hall was quite empty. It could have done with a vigorous
wash down, but apart from this it retained the dignity of the day on
which it was built. Contrastingly, both the rooms leading off it gave
an immediate impression of being disgraced. And the reason was
obvious. Not only were the carpets and curtains in the last stages of
decay. The rooms were crowded &mdash; and crowded with junk. It wouldn't
all be junk, indeed, if transported to a junk-shop. But it was junk
here.
   <p>Appleby concentrated on the room on his right. There was a
further open door at the other side of it, through which it was
possible to see part of another room beyond. This seemed to be
crowded in the same way. And neither room was furnished with the
slightest attempt at individual character or even specific function.
There were beds and there were sideboards. There were desks which
looked as if they had come from massive Victorian offices, and there
were dressing-tables which looked as if they had come from penurious
Victorian servants' dormitories. The walls were covered with
pictures &mdash; oils, water-colours and steel-engravings side by side.
There were bags of golf-clubs and bundles of tennis-rackets. There
was a vaulting horse and a croquet-box and a stuffed bear and a
harmonium. And in the disposition of all these crowded objects there
was only one principle to be observed. It was a principle, however,
that struck Appleby as a notable one. Nothing was entirely concealed
behind anything else.
   <p>In the minute which it took Appleby to absorb all this, Veere
House was as soundless as the tomb. If the false Astarte were really
here, it must surely be in the character of a Sleeping Beauty. In
which case, Jimmy Heffer had certainly taken on the r&ocirc;le of Prince
Charming. But whether his plan for arousing the lady was at all
moral &mdash; whether, indeed, they mightn't both wake up to find themselves
in gaol &mdash; was a different matter. Anyway, they must now be hunted
out. Appleby was about to address himself to this task when he became
aware that the deathly stillness of the place had been broken. It had
been broken by a light, firm tapping from &mdash; he judged &mdash; some distant
part of the ground floor on which he stood.
   <p>The tapping came nearer. You didn't have to remember Treasure
Island and the blind pirate to be a little unnerved by it. Appleby,
who had fought for his life in thieves' kitchens almost as often as
Sexton Blake, felt a momentary tingling of the scalp. And then &mdash; at
the far end of the farther room at which he had been glancing &mdash; the
occasion of the tapping appeared.
   <p>It was an old woman. She came from the shadow of some remoter
corridor into a shaft of afternoon sunshine falling through the
farthest of a series of windows which extended between Appleby and
herself. As she did so, the sound of her stick &mdash; for the tapping did
proceed from a stick &mdash; was muted but still irrationally alarming. She
had passed from a tiled floor to a carpeted one.
   <p>It was a quick tapping &mdash; so that it suggested itself as indeed
produced by a blind person rather than a lame one. But this was
delusive. The old woman had eyes that could see. That she was using
them was almost the first impression you had of her. She was
advancing towards Appleby with her head turned steadily to her left.
Her stick was in her right hand. With her left hand &mdash; its
index-finger extended &mdash; she was making spasmodic but purposeful
movements as she advanced.
   <p>She was very old. She was in black. The black was relieved by a
white collar and a white cap. And this, of course, was what made her
uncanny &mdash; uncanny as she advanced through this decorous house, a house
of the kind in which the successors of Sir Christopher Wren had
tactfully refined upon the Dutch taste of William and Mary. The old
woman was like an old woman by Rembrandt. That was it.
   <p>Of course it didn't make sense. Mrs Kipper was not,
presumably, a Kipper. Very probably she had been a Miss Smith or a
Miss Jones. But perhaps she had grown into the place... Now she had
passed into the shadow between two windows &mdash; and now she was in clear
faint sunlight again. She was nearer. And she wasn't &mdash; Appleby saw &mdash;
a Rembrandt, after all. She was just a Frans Hals. She hadn't &mdash; that
was to say &mdash; grown out of the flesh with age. She was an ordinary
acquisitive old woman.
   <p>But no &mdash; she wasn't quite ordinary, either. She was behaving in
too extraordinary a way. For he could see, now, what that left
index-finger was doing. It was ticking things off. It was ticking
off all those rubbishing material possessions, no one among which
quite concealed any other.
   <p>
   <p>The pathological old miser &mdash; for that, of course, was what she
was &mdash; advanced steadily towards Appleby. She looked at him, and
frowned. He ought not to have been there to be counted. She stopped,
and spoke sharply.
   <p><quote>Young man,</quote> she said, <quote>are you Richardson's clerk?</quote>
   <p>It certainly wasn't that she was purblind. A glance from her
eyes told you that she saw everything. So Appleby felt rejuvenated.
Whether he was a young man was, after all, a relative matter. On the
other hand, he certainly wasn't Richardson's clerk. So he had better
say so.
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he replied. <quote>My name is Appleby, and I have come to
call on your niece. You must forgive me for walking in. I seemed to
have some difficulty with the bell at the front door.</quote>
   <p>Mrs Kipper &mdash; as she must be presumed to be &mdash; ignored this. She
had come to a halt for a moment, but now she walked on &mdash; crossing her
elegant hall and entering the first of the rooms on its farther side.
At the same time, she signed to Appleby to accompany her. She gave
the impression of being prepared to listen to him, provided this did
not distract her from the more important task of checking over her
property. This still took place entirely on her left hand. No doubt
there was going to be a return journey.
   <p><quote>I asked</quote> &mdash; Mrs Kipper said &mdash; <quote>because Richardson is in the
house now. I heard his voice as he went upstairs. He has no business
here. I have a good mind to turn him out of the place.</quote>
   <p><quote>Isn't Mr Richardson your solicitor?</quote> Appleby asked this
very much at a venture.
   <p><quote>Certainly not. My solicitor is Mr Wiggins of Gray's Inn. I
went up to see him only a few days ago. Richardson is a local man,
who did business for my late brother-in-law, Joseph Kipper. Most
mistakenly and unnecessarily, Joseph left a sum of money in trust for
the education of my niece. Richardson administered it. But that is
all over. The money has been spent and the trust discharged. The
girl may send for him as she pleases. But he hasn't a penny left to
give her, all the same. Unless out of his own pocket.</quote>
   <p><quote>Your niece Astarte?</quote>
   <p>Mrs Kipper had now nearly reached the far end of the room. And
she took time off the more serious business of her peregrination to
look sharply at Appleby.
   <p><quote>Astarte? Stuff and nonsense! My niece's name is plain
Jane.</quote>
   <p><quote>Plain Jane, I am told, is one of the loveliest girls in
England.</quote> It was again in an experimental spirit that Appleby
offered this. What it produced from Mrs Kipper was a cackle of
highly disagreeable laughter.
   <p><quote>Lovely? All the more reason why she should marry Charles
Onions. They will cancel each other out, so far as looks go. Mr
Onions is a revoltingly ugly man.</quote>
   <p><quote>I see.</quote> And indeed Appleby was beginning to see what might
be called the archetypal simplicity of the situation at Veere House.
<quote>Your niece has no wish to marry this revoltingly ugly man. But she
is penniless. And he is the match that you design for her.</quote>
   <p><quote>You express it very clearly,</quote> Mrs Kipper said. And she
walked on. <quote>The announcement,</quote> she said presently, <quote>would look
well in The Times &mdash; supposing one were to waste money in that way.
<QUOTE>

<text id=LOBL14>
   <p><quote>Very interesting indeed,</quote> Miss Hocking murmured when he
ended. <quote>But I'm afraid I can't enlighten you. Not at all. Mrs.
Pritchard frequently marked books, made little annotations on passages
that interested her.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, lots of people do that, I know. But this mention of a
neighbour's name &mdash; and his suspecting something &mdash; and the sentence not
finished &mdash; and the book on the floor when she died. Come now, Miss
Hocking, you can't tell me you don't think that adds up to
something.</quote>
   <p>She didn't answer, just looked down, her eyes moving slightly
behind lowered lids.
   <p>Satisfied that he had silenced her, he said: <quote>This message &mdash; do
you reckon it could've been for Mrs. McEvoy, warning her that her
husband suspected her of using the boatshed as a place of
assignation?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've told you I have no idea who this warning could have been
for. If it was a warning.</quote>
   <p><quote>Did anyone turn up at her place,</quote> he probed patiently, <quote>soon
after she was dead?</quote>
   <p><quote>Everyone. The news spread quickly, and everyone came in to see
if there was anything they could do.</quote>
   <p>Grogan turned to Stephen. <quote>What were the grounds for your and
Mrs. McEvoy's divorce?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>Desertion,</quote> Stephen said promptly, and flicked on a lighter
and lighted a cigarette.
   <p><quote>On whose part?</quote>
   <p><quote>Mine. On our return from Singapore things weren't too happy
between us, and I left her and she divorced me.</quote>
   <p>And that was that, Grogan thought. A nice clean decent
desertion, and she never so much as turned her eyes on any other
bloke! No! A brick wall here every bit as thick as the old girl was
putting up.
   <p>Pointedly, Miss Hocking reached over and took Stephen's cup, and
put it back on the tray and straightened the things on it as though to
say, Good morning, Inspector, and I hope you're satisfied with what
you haven't learnt.
   <p>Forestalling her, Grogan got up, took his hat off the chair and
stood a moment turning the brim round in his hands. <quote>By the way,</quote>
he said, and kept his eyes steadily on her face, <quote>about where McEvoy
was shot.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes?</quote> she said, as he paused.
   <p><quote>We find now that it didn't happen down by the fowlyard and him
carried indoors. He was shot in the bedroom, as it first appeared.
So it doesn't have to be a strong man after all.</quote>
   <p>Miss Hocking's expression was admirably impassive under his
stare. But the blood that rises to or drains away from the face at
certain moments is under no one's control.
   <p>
   <p>In the shade of a tree on one of the stones that enclosed his
small domain, Jeffrey Cornwall was sitting filling a mid-morning pipe.
To the tune of Cherry Ripe droned several tones flat he rolled
the tobacco round and round in his palms. Round and round and round,
while meditatively, as a cow chewing the cud, he let his eyes rest on
the flat water ahead of him. The near-to-overhead sun seemed to
flatten it still further so that hardly a ripple stirred its surface.
The shadow of a bird flying low was a black cloud, a small fish
leaping was an explosion.
   <p><quote>H'm...h'm...h'm... Ripe I cry, Full  and fair ones
come and buy.</quote> Round and round and round...
   <p>Grogan, leaving Miss Hocking's, stopped to have a word with him.
   <p>Leaning up against the tree, taking out a cigarette and lighting
it, the inspector said there were worse occupations than what Mr.
Cornwall was engaged on! That himself he wasn't half looking forward
to the day when he'd sit in the shade and smoke his pipe and give the
job away.
   <p>Cornwall agreed heartily. He'd always said, Retire while you've
got the health to enjoy your leisure, cultivate your mind instead of
an ulcer. Then, talking of jobs, he wanted to know whether the police
had got any nearer to solving the crime.
   <p>Grogan said that there had been several small developments. For
instance &mdash; and he brought Cornwall up to date about the warning
message written by old Mrs. Pritchard in the book.
   <p>Cornwall listened, blew a cloud of fragrant smoke, and pressed
the tobacco down with his thumb.
   <p><quote>Would you think,</quote> Grogan asked, <quote>that McEvoy suspected his
wife of meeting a feller in the boatshed?</quote>
   <p><quote>What fellow?</quote> Cornwall wanted to know in exchange, with an
upward squint of the eye.
   <p><quote>Say, Mr. Pritchard.</quote>
   <p>Cornwall gave a soundless whistle. <quote>Well... I don't know
anything about that. Everyone admires the girl, of course. But I
haven't seen any signs of her carrying on with anyone. But then, more
than likely, I wouldn't have seen it if it'd been right under my nose.
I've got beyond the stage, thank God, of being interested in love
affairs, wouldn't give a damn even if it was my own. And frankly I
don't think Boris would've cared two hoots if she'd had a dozen men in
the boatshed.</quote>
   <p><quote>No? How say he wanted to divorce her and was snooping around
for evidence?</quote>
   <p>Cornwall rejected this, too, with a shake of his long, thick
head. <quote>No...</quote> He enveloped a passing fly in a cloud of smoke.
<quote>No. Divorces cost money.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, he had a bit, hadn't he? Didn't have to work, seemed
comfortable enough.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, but he didn't like to spend it. Not in getting rid of a
wife when all he had to say was &mdash; if he wanted to, that is &mdash; <squote>I know
what you're up to, beat it</squote>.</quote>
   <p><quote>Look, if you can prove adultery against a wife you don't have
to keep her. If you haven't got the evidence but just turn her out on
suspicion, she can force you to support her. Maybe it wouldn't've
suited her to clear out with nothing, even if it wasn't much of a
match for a girl as young and pretty as that.</quote>
   <p><quote>You may have something there,</quote> Cornwall nodded.
   <p><quote>For Dal's sake, too, she might've wanted to stay with him.
However, I wouldn't know. All that side of life &mdash; I'm not concerned
with it.</quote>
   <p>Grogan, looking down at him thought, Not a bad looking old cove.
Upright and well-preserved, hair still dark and thick. Was he a bit
too emphatic about how little interest he had in the other sex?
   <p>He said suddenly: <quote>By the way, Mr. Cornwall, about that gun
of yours.</quote>
   <p><quote>By jove, yes. When am I going to get it back?</quote>
   <p><quote>Chatting with Mrs. McEvoy, she says again that she never saw
her husband fire a gun, or speak of shooting.</quote>
   <p><quote>Doesn't mean a thing. He was an odd sort of chap. He'd plant
vegetables and forget to water them, yet he'd wage war on anything
that took a nibble at them.</quote>
   <p><quote>His wife says he didn't give a damn for the vegetables.</quote>
   <p><quote>He didn't give a damn till somebody else wanted them &mdash; even if
it was only a rabbit. He was like that about a lot of things. He
didn't give a damn for a lot of his old records but he'd hit the roof
if young Dal Owen touched them.</quote>
   <p><quote>You'd say, then, McEvoy wasn't too fond of his brother-in-law?
I thought that might be why he came down here to your place to
sleep.</quote>
   <p><quote>Look, Inspector, I wouldn't know. Don't quote me,</quote> Cornwall
said hastily.
   <p>No, Grogan thought as he nodded and passed on his way, Don't
quote me &mdash; don't expect any opinion &mdash; don't expect any help. Don't
help the police if there's a dozen murderers loose in the community.
Stand on the sidelines and cheer on anyone out to down the cops.
Well, he'd forget 'em all if he could just get one bit more on the
old girl.
   <p>Half-way up the hill, he met Manning coming down it.
   <p>Grudgingly, Manning admitted that the other's guess had not been
too bad a one. He'd just been talking to the Fordham police, and this
was the way it was...
<head>CHAPTER 15</head>
   <p>THE FRYS WERE HOME BY MIDDAY. There had been no nice little
lunch out, no trip to the pictures; instead, the hire car deposited
them at the top, and they came down the hill even more slowly than
they had gone up it. Edward's face was still more pale and drawn, and
Jane's manner more determinedly cheerful than when they had set out.
   <p>Walking ahead, as earlier, she quickly opened the door with her
key so as to have it wide before he reached it, and hurried into the
living-room, lowered the blinds half-way, arranged cushions on the
sofa, and went out to the refrigerator to get him a cool drink. She
sat and watched him as he sipped the milk and soda; and now one more
fear was added to all the others in Jane's eyes. One fear worse than
the others, worse than the hateful children in class, the birds in the
morning, the frogs in the night.
   <p>Edward had voiced the fear several times in the car on the drive
home; and each time, with dry mouth and a faith that she was far from
feeling, Jane had said:
   <p><quote>Don't worry, Eddie. It's like the confessional.</quote>
   <p><quote>Should be, but is it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course it is. Of course it is.</quote>
   <p>Even now, when steps sounded on the veranda, she said, with
last-ditch courage; ~<quote>That'll be Vetch's boy,</quote> though the steps
were clearly of four feet, not two, and Vetch's boy never came to the
front door.
   <p>The entry of Grogan and Manning, following on Manning's
information to Grogan, left no room for further ostrich tactics on
Jane's part.
   <p>The Frys greeted the visitors with no small talk. Jane, having
brought them in, murmured: ~<quote>The police, Eddie,</quote> and went back to
her chair and they sat looking at the two detectives with their
habitual air of resigned anxiety.
   <p>The room was as trim and orderly as the Frys themselves. From
year to year not the smallest thing in it was ever changed. Jane
dusted it once a day, and put each object back in its allotted place.
   <p>Grogan wasn't long in explaining the reason for their call: the
Frys' visit to a doctor's surgery, their visit to a chemist near by,
the purchase of surgical lint, bandages and antiseptics. The damning
facts gathered by a police constable in Fordham couldn't be denied,
nor could the deductions to be drawn from them.
   <p>Yes &mdash; yes &mdash; and yes, Edward admitted. It was his blood that had
spattered the stones in the yard outside Boris McEvoy's fowl-run.
   <p>Edward, his legs along the sofa, reached out and put his glass
down on a table. Jane, her eyes filled with burning intensity, seemed
not to breathe now. It would have been hard to say just what the Frys
were clinging to with such tenacity, life in the austere house seemed
so joyless, its barrenness so little different from that of that
<quote>fine and private place</quote>, the grave.
   <p><quote>Where were you wounded, Mr. Fry?</quote> Grogan asked when the
facts had been stated and admitted.
   <p><quote>In the calf of the leg, a flesh wound,</quote> Edward rapped out.
<quote>The bullet ricocheted off a stone. My wife thought it had begun to
look more than slightly angry today, and I was persuaded to see a
doctor. Otherwise, we could have been able to keep the whole
miserable incident to ourselves. Or, even, if I could have relied on
this much-vaunted medical etiquette I might have maintained that the
things I bought at the chemist's were for some minor injury that had
nothing to do with McEvoy's death.</quote>
   <p><quote>Who fired the shot?</quote>
   <p><quote>Boris McEvoy. I've lived in this locality for three years, and
all I ask is to be left in peace to &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Was it deliberate?</quote>
   <p><quote>Kindly allow me to tell the story in my own fashion,</quote> Edward
rasped at him. The stern schoolmaster's glance was turned on the
inspector. Edward would be in control of the class and none other,
and interrupters would be promptly dealt with. His injured leg up on
the sofa did little to lessen his air of authority; his uplifted hand
commanded it, and the sharp turn of his head and the snap of his eyes.

   <p>I was alone at the moment, though we were two in the household.
My younger brother Tom shared our holding of some two hundred acres,
but he'd gone out to see about the barn door which was banging in the
wind, so if anyone had concluded that we two bachelors were also
wealthy, here was I  another such opportunity for murder. It
was fancy I know, but its possibility made me nervous. Tom was a man
you could never be sure of. He was eccentric, moody, and shrewd,
secretive to a fault, fond of company and very fond of liquor. He
made every trifling incident an excuse for a <squote>celebration</squote>, as he
called it, though he was steady enough when it suited him to be. But
as I said, he was most unreliable. I was the eldest of the surviving
sons, and three years Tom's senior. I had a different temperament; I
was always one to count the costs beforehand, I seldom smoked, I'd no
taste for it, and as to strong drink, well it didn't appeal to me,
though I took it when I considered it to be in my interests to do so,
otherwise I looked on it as a sheer waste of good money. I enjoyed
work for work's sake; a violin well played, or a well told story. Tom
was the reverse of my tastes, though good at heart. He was
thoughtless, more than selfish; an unknown quantity would I think best
describe him.
   <p>As I sat there musing and waiting his return, a sudden and
powerful gust of wind shook the entire cottage, which trembled
violently and was accompanied by a sound of tearing, which terminated
in a dull thud in an adjacent room.
   <p>At this I jumped to my feet in alarm, as I'd not have been at all
surprised if the entire roof had collapsed. It was very old and in
need of repair. However nothing further happened and I became curious
as to what had apparently fallen. Taking the lamp from the table I
went to investigate, but no sooner had I opened the room door than my
lamp was nigh extinguished by a violent draught. I was able to see
that the gable end of the roof had been ripped off and swept away.
Luckily it was a fine though windy night, or we would certainly have
been flooded. It was a room seldom used however, so things might have
been worse. The room contained little furniture &mdash; in fact I knew its
contents by heart, so that when I saw an unfamiliar parcel lying on
the floor I was mystified, and before another gust of wind came I had
hurriedly lifted up that loosely tied parcel and returned to my room
as I was fearful of my lamp's chimney being destroyed by the draught.
   <p>The parcel was of a light though rustly nature, and appeared to
have been carelessly packed. Its cord was useless in effect, so I'd
no trouble in its removal, on doing so I was dumbfounded by its
unexpected contents. I must have stood some time motionless in awe.
On examination I found it contained about twenty bundles of one pound
notes, which I later discovered amounted to &pound;2,010 in all.
   <p>When my sudden excitement had subsided, I found I was becoming
very nervous, which later developed into anxiety as to what I ought to
do. I felt I could not consult anyone for advice, and I was equally
uncertain if I should even tell Tom my brother, for if we did share it
he might talk in his cups, or indeed drink its entirety, and if I kept
it secret, I could not use it without he in time asking awkward
questions as to where I had obtained all the money. To lodge it in
the bank might also make for embarrassment so I thought at the time.
Now I know better. There was only one alternative and that was to
inform the police. I didn't relish that. As a final solution I was
undecided. Its destruction by fire, although I was loath to destroy
wealth. Before however I had made up my mind as to what I would do
with it, the room door unexpectedly opened and Tom entered, sober and
silently. I'd been so engrossed in my thoughts that I never heard his
step above the high winds.
   <p>When he saw the pile of notes, he rushed over and picked up a
bundle in silence examining it thoroughly as if to see if they were
real. Then he spoke hoarsely to me, saying <squote>Where did you get
these? Are they yours, and were you counting your wealth in my
absence? Or maybe you've stolen them, Eh?</squote> His eyes were staring
at me wildly as if he'd not hesitate to do me an injury if I gave him
what he might think was a false explanation. I could see that he had
already made himself a satisfactory answer. That had always been his
piggish way &mdash; judgment before, and in spite of, any evidence.
   <p>I replied at once. To have hesitated would have meant suspicion,
and he had a tinge of that already. I told him that I'd found the
money, relating in detail all I've said before. He kept watching me
all the time incredulously. I could quite understand this. It did
appear fantastic and almost improbable. But when I'd ceased talking
he said, <squote>Well Jim I believe you, I don't like it</squote>.
   <p>I agreed it certainly was unpleasant and peculiar. Suddenly he
pressed down the brown paper wrapper and said <squote>Look there! See it
has poor old David Tuns' name written on it</squote>.
   <p>I followed his pointing finger, and sure enough the name and
address was there, showing also a cancelled revenue stamp. A thought
flashed through my mind, but before I could give it expression Tom
banged his fist down on the table and exclaimed <squote>It's surely blood
money and will bring bad luck on us! 'Tis plain that the murderer
wrapped his ill-gotten gains in the first thing that he could find and
placed it in our thatch. But why didn't he ever return? Was it to
throw suspicion on us two lone men?</squote> Again he eyed me &mdash; I thought
suspiciously as if he thought 'twas I who had done the deed and hid
the money, but as I could give no explanation, I said so. I was
always a man to speak out my mind straight, asking him what we'd do
with the money now that it was here. He paused long at that. Then he
said <squote>Perhaps it were a bank robbery, and if so the number of the
notes would be known</squote>.
   <p>It was possible, though hardly probable, I said, <squote>Yet the late
David was not believed to have been a man of means, so it was,</squote> I
added, <squote>quite possible that 'twas never his and the wrapper a mere
coincidence</squote>. I was quite convinced and Tom agreed, that David had
never hidden it in our thatch with his address on it, though some
people are queer, and 'twould have saved him income tax to have done
so.
   <p>We could form no conclusion as to its origin, but had to face the
fact of its disposal.
   <p>When I suggested the police, Tom would not even listen to me, so
after a long debate far into the night we decided to leave it till
morning and then decide. Next morning however he was up earlier than
usual and was attending the live stock when I came into the room at my
customary time. When I'd finished breakfast and went to find him I
did so,  and commenced to repair our damaged roof, as the
wind had ceased although it was still overcast. I questioned him as
to why he hadn't asked Hattie, our local expert thatcher to do the
job. He muttered something about not wanting strangers about our home
as they knew too much of others  domestic affairs already. I
could perceive that he was in a very sour mood, so decided not to
pursue the matter, nor indeed to refer to our agreement of the
previous night about the disposal of my find. There was no hurry
anyway, I thought.
   <p>It seems hard to believe now, but it was not till five months
later that I brought up the subject in desperation. Tom made no
reference ever to it, and it was early Spring, with a lot of urgent
improvements due on our farm. Extra money could be usefully spent on
it, and if it was a thing that Tom agreed, I'd decided to spend a
discreet figure on this objective, so as not to arouse local
suspicions or talk. To make a big outlay was to start the busybody
neighbours  tongues with Jim Kogh's sudden wealth, and
indeed &mdash; ~<squote>Where did he get it?</squote> &mdash; 'twas easily started, but
mighty hard to stop.
   <p>Mid-February then it was, when I again approached Tom asking him
why it was that he didn't help me to decide our windfall of over five
months ago. He said that he'd been waiting for me, and so I saw that
one was waiting for the other, in some kind of awkward fear. It was
that  he eventually agreed with me that, barring telling
either the police, or any of our neighbours, we were quite within our
rights in equally dividing it, as 'twas found unclaimed on our
premises, and so it was that we had a mutual share out of the &pound;2,010.
He took it without a murmur, but turned as he made to leave the room.
At the door he said: <squote>I hope this does not get me into any
trouble</squote>.
   <p>I don't pretend to know what he meant by saying it, but it again
entered my mind that he might spend it recklessly on drink, and give
our secret away, for he was, as I've already said, a very intemperate
man when it suited him. I replied that I hoped it would not, unless
he ran the way of trouble. I thought my hint would be sufficient, but
he only looked at me and said that there were more ways of getting
into troubles than drink, and money was one of them, especially as it
had been queerly come by. With that he went out. I couldn't
understand him at all. He appeared to be both nervous and vexed, but
why, I couldn't even imagine.
   <p>Sometime later &mdash; 'twould be at least eighteen months I'd say &mdash;
to my great surprise I saw Tom emerging from the delapidated old house
of the late Dave Tuns, the neighbour whom I've already referred to who
had been found murdered and whose house was still unoccupied and a
ruin. We locals wouldn't enter it. It was the late owner's property
and he had died without issue or relatives. It could not therefore be
legally disposed of, though Tom and I had acquired the adjacent lands
by local authority. I saw Tom coming out of this dreaded house one
day, but I refrained from mentioning it to him for a time, as 'twas
really none of my business. About a month later than this, he told me
one morning that he had had several bad dreams about the late David
and that he was going to have him prayed for, and to put a stone or
suchlike to his memory.
   <p>Why he should decide to do this was beyond me. David was no
relation of ours, and a long time dead, but I didn't pursue this.
Nevertheless I was mystified as to why Tom took a sudden interest
after such a lapse of time as eighteen years. I was equally surprised
that he was not drinking. This was contrary indeed to my
expectations, for he was not one to hold money, much or little.
   <p>Later I heard in a roundabout way that he was visiting a nearby
widow and her daughter, both considered to be well off in property and
gilt-edged investments, and above criticism.

<text id=LOBL16>
   <p>Farland sat waiting in the lounge. He'd yet to meet Dr.
Halset, who'd arrived just after dinner. Following a telephone call,
a little earlier, Winter had said, <quote>I'd like an opportunity of
explaining you to Halset before he sees you. Would you mind very
much? You can stay in the dining room, or...</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll be in my bedroom,</quote> Farland had told him. <quote>There's
every comfort, and I've a letter to write.</quote>
   <p><quote>So glad you understand. You'll hear us come upstairs. He's
certain to want Wally to retire early and will probably give him a
stronger sedative. When we're through we'll join you in the
lounge.</quote>
   <p><quote>How much will you tell Dr. Halset about the reasons for my
being here?</quote> Farland had asked.
   <p><quote>I'll tell him as little as possible. He will, of course, have
to know about your rescuing Wally from the cliffs last night. That
falls into the medical picture. But the local gossip and other
troubles are outside his province. You'll be able to take your cue
from me.</quote>
   <p>While he was waiting for them, Farland reviewed his own decision
to say nothing of what he'd learned during the day. For one thing, he
was reluctant to reveal the source of his information. He was
prepared to believe Susie Bowers, but Winter might feel very
differently. It wouldn't suit Farland's plans to have the girl banned
from the house on the grounds that she was an irresponsible gossip.
He'd other valid reasons for silence. So far there was no proof, no
confirmation, and there was still much to be discovered. He strongly
suspected that Smail was one of the men who'd been watching the house
at night; but the evidence of the chewing-gum was circumstantial.
Considered objectively it only proved that one of the intruders could
have been Smail. The identification of the second man as either
Harker or Beddoes was even flimsier.
   <p>This was a lead. No more. He'd have to watch them; and if the
suspicions were proved right, then he'd have to discover who was
employing them. And had the same unknown person induced Bowers to
start the talk in the village? Or was that fortuitous?
   <p>Farland summed up. Quite fair to hold out on Winter. It seems
he's keeping things back. If he knows about the knife... And if he
knows that Wally did attack the girl...
   <p>There were voices in the hall and Winter entered with the
visitor. He effected introductions. Halset was not at all as Farland
had pictured. He was a shortish man of slight build. The nose was
the predominant feature of his face. It was long and beakish, coming
out so far that one felt the tip must intrude in his vision whenever
he glanced downwards. He was almost bald, the remaining hair tufting
at the sides and tending to curl at the back.
   <p>He looked a mournful man and his handshake was loose; but his
voice was well modulated and, Farland imagined, could be soothing.
   <p><quote>Mr. Farland, I've heard how magnificently you behaved last
night. I'm thankful you were here and averted what would certainly
have been a tragedy.</quote>
   <p><quote>I did what I could,</quote> Farland murmured. He glanced at Rufus
Winter. <quote>It was a situation that called for somebody pretty
athletic.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'd not the nerve &mdash; let alone the body,</quote> Winter said
candidly. <quote>Let me get you a drink. How very fortunate, doctor, that
you should happen to be coming down this way. It's not often you
leave town.</quote>
   <p><quote>I escape too rarely,</quote> Halset said. <quote>I prescribe rest for
myself; but I never manage to take it. However &mdash; there was this
long-standing invitation and I suddenly found myself with a number of
cancelled appointments. My secretary managed some re-arranging of the
remaining ones and &mdash; well &mdash; here I am.</quote>
   <p><quote>Taking on an extra fifty miles of driving and a bit more
work,</quote> Winter commented. <quote>I appreciate it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't worry. I don't mind driving. In fact, I do so little
these days that I welcome it.</quote>
   <p>When they were sitting comfortably, a drink at hand, Winter said:
<quote>You can talk freely to Farland. I've told him very little &mdash;
largely because I don't sufficiently understand your methods.</quote>
   <p><quote>Hypnosis,</quote> Halset said. He moved a little in his chair so
that he was facing Farland. <quote>I expect you know that it's possible &mdash;
with the right subject &mdash; to virtually turn back the clock.
Fortunately for him, Waldo Sutton's a good subject. I can put him
into a hypnotic sleep very quickly. It took longer at first and the
results were no more than encouraging; but now we've reached the stage
where he falls into a trance in response to a simple word formula.
While he's in this condition I can take him back, make him relive
portions of the past. In particular that night of the air-crash. You
know of the disaster?</quote>
   <p>Farland nodded.
   <p>Halset continued, <quote>The value of hypnotic treatment lies in the
increased suggestibility of the patient and also what we call
abreaction &mdash; bringing repressed material back to consciousness. It's
a complex matter, not easy to explain in a few words.</quote>
   <p><quote>I think I get the general idea,</quote> Farland said. <quote>Do you give
this hypnotic treatment to all your patients?</quote>
   <p><quote>Indeed, no. It's only possible in certain cases. And it's
only one among many methods of treatment.</quote>
   <p>Winter said, <quote>You always have a soothing effect on Wally. We
shouldn't have any more trouble for the time being.</quote>
   <p><quote>I hope not,</quote> Halset said. He didn't sound so confident as
Winter. In fact it seemed to Farland, who'd been watching closely,
that Halset was not entirely at ease. He gave the impression of being
a worried man and once or twice, during the explanation of the
treatment being given to Wally, he'd glanced at Winter as though for
support. Or is it just, Farland wondered, that I'm not too favourably
impressed?
   <p>He wanted to study the psychiatrist more closely. He couldn't be
professionally critical but he might evaluate the man. However there
was no chance, for Halset looked at his watch and announced he must be
on his way.
   <p>Winter, at Farland's shoulder, said quietly, <quote>I hesitate to
suggest you should run any risk; but I'd like to be sure our unknown
friends aren't watching.</quote>
   <p><quote>Leave it to me,</quote> Farland assured him.
   <p>Halset had not risen from his seat. Winter said, <quote>You'll
excuse Farland? He's a man of habit &mdash; likes his evening exercise.</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course,</quote> Halset said. He accompanied the loose handshake
with a murmured hope that they might meet again sometime. Farland
left the house by a back door, just behind the garage, and here he
paused thoughtfully. Did it matter if the men who watched the house
saw Halset's car leave? Did Winter have a genuine reason, or was it
just a smooth dismissal? Remembering that Halset had remained seated
Farland favoured this explanation.
   <p>He thought, Halset sees me &mdash; and then they get me out of the way.
Could be worth checking.
   <p>Moving with cautious silence he reached the terrace and
approached the windows. One of them, at the side of the doors, was
open at the top. He moved a small garden bench nearer to the wall and
stepped up on it, leaning towards the window.
   <p>Halset was talking. <quote>I still don't like it. I don't like the
risk. We should have kept...</quote>
   <p><quote>Nonsense!</quote> Winter interrupted briskly. <quote>I know this is
complicated; but I can handle it. We won't fail.</quote>
   <p><quote>I wish you'd never...</quote> Halset lowered his voice, or was
moving farther from the window. Farland could hear no more; not even
Winter's reply. He guessed the two men must be leaving the lounge.
   <p>He jumped down and replaced the bench. He went back to the
garage and stood there waiting. Within five minutes there was the
unmistakable slam of a car door. As the car drove off he made his way
along the hedge. Winter might stroll round the house or come out on
the terrace and Farland was anxious to give him no cause for
suspicion.
   <p>Why was Halset uneasy and what was the risk he'd mentioned? Were
they discussing some aspect of the treatment Wally was undergoing? Or
was that last private conversation in no way connected with Wally?
Winter had business interests &mdash; or so he claimed. It wasn't
impossible for Halset to be financially involved. Investments,
perhaps. He'd presumably come to know Winter quite well. Certainly
it sounded as though Winter was making the decisions, and this rather
ruled out medical matters. That sentence interrupted by Winter might
have been: We should have kept to the original investments. Winter
might be playing the market. That could be complicated; but he'd
probably feel himself competent to handle it.
   <p>Farland thought, If money's the answer it's nothing to do with
me, and politely pushing me off was justified. But was money the
answer? Farland tried to connect the words with the whispering
campaign against Wally, ignoring Winter's assurance that Halset would
not be told of this. The result was unsatisfactory.
   <p>By this time he was nearing the bushes, so he dismissed the
overheard conversation from his mind. He needed to have his wits
about him. He'd no intention of being caught as he had on the
previous night.
   <p>He came to a sudden stop, hearing a slight rustling ahead. The
sounds became more definite and he had a glimpse of someone running
across a gap between bushes, heading towards the orchard. He swore
under his breath. By some ill-fortune he'd been spotted first. He
plunged forward in pursuit but still using caution, remembering there
might well be two men.
   <p>By the time he reached the orchard, though, it seemed certain
there was only one intruder, who was gaining ground. Thanks to
Susie's guidance earlier in the day he knew his quarry was making for
the cliff path; but this was of no particular value, for the man
obviously knew the layout much more intimately.
   <p>Racing along the narrow path by the allotments Farland at last
had a clear view of the man he was after and there was no mistaking
the tall, gangling figure. It was Smail. Within seconds a bend in
the track hid him from view and Farland didn't see him again.
   <p>When he joined the wider cliff path Farland stopped. Smail was
too cunning to keep to the path; he'd be making his way under cover of
bushes and stretches of hedge. Which was his way? To the
village? To Brigantine Cove, where the Diana might be lying? It
had to be a guess and even if he made the right choice everything was
in Smail's favour. There were hundreds of places where he could hide.
   <p>Farland accepted defeat. He regained his breath, listening hard,
but there were no betraying sounds. He lit a cigarette and began to
retrace his steps. Alongside one of the allotments was a fence and
here he rested for a short while.
   <p>It was a warm night and he was tempted to stay longer, but he'd
still quite a distance to cover and he'd the thought that Winter would
be anxious. So he moved on, walking briskly.
   <p>When he finally came to the garden and had a clear view of the
house he could see the french windows were open and Winter was pacing
the terrace. Farland hurried across the overgrown lawn and Winter,
seeing him, came hurrying down the terrace steps. <quote>Thank heaven
you're back, Farland. I've been so worried! I was trying to screw up
sufficient courage to come and look for you. Scared after last
night &mdash; I have to confess it. You're not hurt?</quote> He sounded
anxious.
   <p><quote>No. Someone was spying, but unfortunately he saw me before I
spotted him. Chased him as far as the cliff path &mdash; and then lost
him.</quote>
   <p><quote>Did you get a good look at him?</quote> Winter asked eagerly.
   <p>Farland's hesitation was brief. <quote>The chap had too big a start &mdash;
plus the advantage of being on familiar ground.</quote> There was little
to be gained by identifying the intruder as Smail, he felt.

<text id=LOBL17>
   <p><squote>You got my message through the flower-seller?</squote>
   <p><squote>What message and what flower-seller?</squote>
   <p><squote>Please yourself. There's other talent for hire.</squote> Loddon
began to signal the waiter.
   <p><squote>All right, no need to go off half-cocked. You might be a
flick.</squote>
   <p><squote>Do I look like one?</squote>
   <p><squote>No...</squote>
   <p><squote>Okay. Anywhere we can talk?</squote>
   <p><squote>I'll leave in a moment; you go out the entrance where they come
in from Coventry Street. I'll probably be around.</squote> The man got up
and left, pausing a moment at the door where the porter wanted to know
why he had no bill.
   <p>Loddon paid his own account, finished his cigarette and got up.
He looked about him, wondering if Sergeant Leinster was in the room.
If so, he was not visible.
   <p>In Coventry Street the reporter halted outside the doors of the
Corner House, waiting. His table companion appeared, touching his arm
and making a head jerk towards Rupert Street. They walked in silence,
turning into a wide court half-way up on the right where, half-way
along it, the man stopped.
   <p><squote>Now friend, what's the job?</squote>
   <p><squote>Your name Light?</squote>
   <p><squote>What's that got to do with it?</squote> His tone was wary.
   <p><squote>I never talk to men without names.</squote>
   <p><squote>Choosey, aren't you? Call me Shiner. If you've got any funny
ideas about anything, forget them.</squote> He touched his left arm that
Loddon had noticed was carried slightly away from his body, the
sign-manual of the man habitually used to a shoulder-holster.
   <p><squote>I'm never funny when I'm out on business. But I'm damned if
I'm going to talk in a place like this. Know anywhere private?</squote>
   <p><squote>I might do, if you give me a lead on something interesting, for
example.</squote>
   <p>Loddon did not say anything, fumbling in the left-hand pocket of
his trench-coat. He half grinned when he saw Light's hand begin to
move towards his left armpit. When the reporter's hand reappeared, it
contained a thick packet. He flicked the top fold, revealing
five-pound notes in what was a very large collection of them.
   <p><squote>This good enough? Plenty more where these came from.</squote>
   <p>Light's quick look was expert.
   <p><squote>Looks about seventy of them in that lot.</squote>
   <p><squote>Eighty, to be precise.</squote>
   <p><squote>Good enough. We'll get a cab. Got any objection if I ask you
to hold your hat over your eyes on the journey, friend? I don't
advertise my home.</squote>
   <p>Loddon was amused at Light's caution, but impressed by it when he
stopped a cab in Wardour Street and held out a card to the man,
telling him to drive to the address it bore.
   <p>From behind the shelter of his hat Loddon, whose knowledge of
London is almost as good as Superintendent Shott's, knew when they
turned left in Shaftesbury Avenue. From Piccadilly Circus, following
the curious angle round Hyde Park Corner, it was fairly easy and, by
the slight left hand sway of the cab, Brompton Road was identified.
Then Loddon got confused, but he had an idea they turned round the
Albert Hall and began to twist in a multitude of small streets,
halting at last. If he could not guess the address, he had a shrewd
idea of its whereabouts. When he got out it was in a short,
ill-lighted mews.
   <p>The cab driver was paid off. Light led the way to a door beside
a closed garage. He took a key out of a pocket, smiling without
humour when he saw Loddon looking round.
   <p><squote>Don't worry, friend. You'll never guess it in a thousand
years.</squote>
   <p>Loddon nodded in a baffled fashion, not bothering to add that a
small sign in the distance, caught by a trick of light from a badly
curtained window, said: <squote>Hickliff &mdash; Coals</squote>. He knew he would have
no trouble in finding the mews when he wanted to come again.
   <p>There was darkness behind the door that opened. Not until Loddon
had reached the top was a button touched, and he saw a door on his
right.
   <p><squote>Go on in; it's not locked.</squote>
   <p>The door gave access to a tidily furnished sitting-room where
chintz and Japanese oak predominated. At one end was a large
record-player with, on the facing side of the room, a television set.
   <p><squote>Make yourself at home.</squote> Light threw his coat and hat on a
chair. Loddon retained his own.
   <p><squote>Thanks, I'm not staying long. Only take a few minutes.</squote>
   <p><squote>Sounds like something easy. Drink?</squote> Light moved over to a
table spread with bottles.
   <p><squote>Whisky; if not, beer.</squote>
   <p><squote>Easy.</squote> He filled two glasses and brought them across,
sitting on a low couch facing Loddon. <squote>Health.</squote>
   <p><squote>And yours.</squote> The reporter sipped the drink, setting down the
glass unusually slowly. He was trying to find an angle, not so much
for the purpose of framing a proposition but in the hope of getting
Light to unwittingly give him a slant on the facts he was seeking.
<squote>Now look &mdash;</squote> then he paused. The door he had noticed on the far
side of the room was opened, and a big man with an extremely ugly face
entered. He was yawning and stretching as if he had just woken from
sleep. He stopped, and stared.
   <p><squote>This the prospect?</squote> His voice was soft, almost urbane.
   <p><squote>That's right, Eeky. We was just getting down to business.
He's willing to pay &mdash;</squote>
   <p>Eeky Morris went slowly to a table near the wall, took something
out of it, and turned, a long-barrelled Smith &amp; Wesson Service pistol
in one hand. He made a face at Light's expression of surprise.
   <p><squote>Sucker, aren't you, Shiner? Seen this chap more than once.
Name's Loddon. He's a reporter.</squote>
   <p>The pale blue eyes became narrowed and bitter.
   <p><squote>You sure?</squote>
   <p><squote>Sure I'm sure! Seen him at a coupla trials, and his picture
in the Daily Report, once. And you brought him here!</squote>
   <p><squote>His message came through the pillar-box.</squote>
   <p><squote>That damned flower-merchant!</squote> Morris's voice was sour.
<squote>Probably got the lead from one of the boys. I always told you it's
asking for trouble relying on that old fool.</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm here, too,</squote> Loddon said; he disliked being ignored, even
if the party was scarcely in his favour. <squote>I'm a reporter. Okay.
And what the hell do you propose to do about it?</squote>
   <p>Light was on his toes again. One hand sneaked out and the
reporter's face became white then scarlet where the violence of an
open palm hit it.
   <p><squote>That's what, friend.</squote> He half turned to Morris. <squote>I'll take
him, Eeky?</squote>
   <p><squote>Please yourself. I'll cover him while you frisk him.</squote>
   <p>Loddon submitted meekly to the search, his blue eyes so intently
angry that Light was outstared, completing the search with rough
hands. He swore gently.
   <p><squote>Precisely nothing to identify him. And &mdash;</squote> he swore again.
<squote>Two fivers covering a bundle of scrap cut the same size. You busy
little fellow!</squote> His hand took Loddon on the other cheek, then he
began to remove his jacket. <squote>This is something I'm going to enjoy,
friend.</squote>
   <p>Loddon glanced at Morris's gun, guessed at the proximity of
neighbours, and decided to chance it. Light had only half removed his
jacket, he went forward as if he had jumped. One ready fist came up
from the ground in an almost classic haymaker. Light's head snicked
back; he folded up as if he had suddenly gone boneless, and lay still.
   <p>Morris said something wicked under his breath.
   <p><squote>Clever bastard! Stay where you are, unless &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Unless nothing!</squote> Loddon leapt at him, the comforting zeal
for battle rising with the swift urgency he knew well. <squote>You wouldn't
use that thing here, and you know it!</squote> He dodged the downward lash
of an attempted pistol-whipping, and one fist smacked on Morris's ear
with a comforting thud.
   <p>But Morris was both larger and tougher than his partner. He
threw away the gun, ignoring what must have been a painful blow, and
stepped forward. If he was big, Loddon was not short, if with far
less weight. The two of them stood toe to toe and traded blows with
the efficient economy of men who knew how to fight.
   <p>Loddon realized his weight was just not good enough when Morris
began driving him back. He gave hurriedly, leapt over the chair he
had been sitting on, and before Morris could understand the manoeuvre,
vaulted back again with the help of a shortened handspring. Both his
feet in mid-air hit Morris on the chest.
   <p>The action brought Loddon over, but it was on top of the
partially winded Morris. They began rolling over and over, hands at
throats and eyes, crashing into the silent Shiner Light on the way.
The table of drink bottles came down. They ended against the
record-player which tottered but did not fall, releasing a confetti of
gramophone discs on them.
   <p>Loddon did not think he had the stamina of the other man. He
forced the attack to try and win the fight before he was exhausted,
both of them gouging and punching with a sort of envenomed hate,
grunting and cursing at each other.
   <p>The pleasant sitting-room was becoming a chaos and neither of
them paid any attention to knockings on the wall, the protests of
alarmed and irritated neighbours.
   <p>Morris, pounding steadily at Loddon, seemed determined to take
all the punishment going so long as he could prevail in the end. With
his physique it seemed highly probable he would. He hit the reporter
in the chest with the force of controlled fury.
   <p>But he telegraphed the blow, and Loddon was already moving away.
He grunted, went head over heels and came up against a table behind
the fallen table of drinks. He hurled himself backwards over it,
sliding across and dropping to the far side. Morris angling himself
forward almost simultaneously, got the impact of the table thrust at
him. It was followed by Loddon in a headlong dive over the top.
   <p>They went down with a violence that shook the floor, entangled
themselves and began methodically to try and pound the life out of
each other. It was bitter and merciless, and might have gone on until
the gasping Loddon was finished. But Light's voice came like the lash
of a whip:
   <p><squote>All right, friend; stick 'em up. I'm perfectly ready to use
this thing.</squote>
   <p>Loddon paused, half turning. He saw Light on his knees, holding
Morris's gun, then folded up as Morris's fist drove into his wind with
deliberate savagery.
   <p>It seemed hours before Loddon came out of the wrenching of agony
inside him. It felt as if he would never breathe again, but, somehow,
with little gasps he slowly came to a doubtful normality.
   <p>When Light dug him in the back with the gun, he tried to get up,
failed, and tried again. This time he got to his feet, and stood
there. His hands bunched and he tensed himself to jump at the jeering
Eeky Morris. Light thrust the gun, and Loddon paused.
   <p><squote>All right, guts. If I can't risk firing this thing, I can
still club it, so nark it if you don't want a sore head. Eeky, I want
to know what this chap knows &mdash; it'd pay to take it to certain people,
eh?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes,</squote> Morris, breathing heavily and dabbing at the blood
pouring from a cut ear, looked as if he was going to enjoy the party
after all. <squote>How?</squote>
   <p><squote>Ask him. If he doesn't feel like answering, I can handle
him.</squote> Light looked as if any refusal to answer would suit him; he
stared at Loddon with an intent expression. <squote>Now, friend.</squote>
   <p>A battered, still gasping Loddon grinned crookedly at him.
   <p><squote>Melodrama in A Flat!</squote> It was a poor jest but it seemed funny
enough to laugh at outright, then Loddon's lips curled in agony. The
butt of the Smith &amp; Wesson was slapped viciously against the side of
his knee.
   <p><squote>That'll do to start off with.</squote> Light moved back, waiting
until Loddon's involuntary tears of agony had stopped. <squote>Feel like
being civil, friend?</squote>
   <p><squote>If you put that gun down &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm taking you &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>I think not.</squote> The voice from the door brought round the
heads of the three men.

<text id=LOBL18>
   <p>Shevlin said, <quote>I've got more information for you.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yeah? What?</quote>
   <p><quote>A scream from the Slaytons' living-room can be heard at the
Weeks' if the French doors are open. It can't if they're closed.</quote>
   <p><quote>You tested it?</quote>
   <p><quote>That was my experiment this morning.</quote>
   <p>Willis said, <quote>Good going, Shevlin. That's important.</quote>
   <p>If Shevlin expected a pat on the back from Camp, he didn't get
it. <quote>Yeah,</quote> said the chief, <quote>except he might've been smarter to
find out how loud a scream sounds in Star's bedroom.</quote>
<head>CHAPTER NINE</head>
   <p>The papers Tuesday night spread the murder all over the front
pages. CHAUFFEUR HELD IN SOCIALITE SLAYING were the headlines and
they contained all the nuances of sin and sex that readers ate up. It
was the kind of case the papers loved. There were people in high
places, a beautiful and almost naked woman, and the possibility that
under the bright light of police investigation all sorts of scandals
would be uncovered. It was the dream case and editors had spared no
pains in their effort to give colour to the facts. One enterprising
reporter had dug up an old publicity photo of Phyllis taken when she
was pounding on the doors of show-business and that helped the cause
for it showed her as a ravishing beauty taken, as it had been, under
the best conditions and eleven years before. Phyllis' career on
Broadway was played up; the fact that she had been the prot&eacute;g&eacute;
of a big-name director and that she had, for two years, been married
to Hans Meredith who had since become a prominent playwright. There
were even statements from Meredith and the director in which they both
said flattering things about Phyllis and regretted her untimely death.
   <p>Phyllis was glorified by the articles but her husband fared less
well. In mentioning his five years of marriage, they didn't overlook
the fact that he had divorced an earlier wife who had run off with
another man. It wasn't the sort of material that helped the head of a
hospital and one of the top heart surgeons in the east.
   <p>Wednesday morning's papers took a slightly different approach.
With few developments in the investigation, they turned to interviews
and speculation and the picture they ran was of Ralph, not Phyllis.
It showed him, head lowered, coming out of the Griswold Funeral
Parlour with Harry and May Wilson, and Phyllis' father and mother. He
was wearing a black suit and a black hat and dark glasses and he
didn't look happy. The questions that the articles raised were: Why
was Phyllis Slayton dressed as she was (overlooking the perfectly
plausible possibility that she was getting ready for bed), Why was
nobody at home that particular night, and Who had parked a big car
behind the bushes and gone to see her? The amateur detectives of the
press dismissed the hidden tea service as merely a plant, an attempt
to disguise the real motive for the murder.
   <p>Wednesday was the day of the inquest and the crowds came early.
There were fifty people on the town hall steps at seven-thirty in the
morning and when the auditorium doors were opened at nine, a double
line of people extended across the street and all around the green in
front. The auditorium had eight hundred seats but more than twice
that number were waiting outside and fifteen minutes after the line
started moving, there wasn't a seat to be had outside of the section
reserved for principals and officials. Phyllis Slayton was packing
them in as she never had on Broadway and hundreds had turned out the
night before to file by her bier in the funeral parlour even though
the lid was closed.
   <p>Judge Mansfield, with a flair for the dramatic, strode on to the
platform in a swirl of robes at precisely ten o'clock and the buzz of
the crowd turned into dead silence. He sat behind a table near the
front of the stage beside which an empty chair for witnesses faced the
audience. The inquest was conducted by Town Prosecutor Robert Herring
and Dr. Allen was the first man called.
   <p>Herring spent twenty minutes questioning him with Dr. Allen
answering in a soft voice that people strained to hear. He described
the position and condition of the body and the means by which he
determined the time of death. Then Herring asked him pointedly about
the matter of sexual attack and it was obvious from Herring's manner
that he strongly doubted the claim that there had been none. It
seemed to Herring and all the other people in the hall that no woman,
clad only in a filmy n&eacute;glig&eacute;e, could possibly be strangled
without being attacked, but Allen knew what he knew and he wouldn't be
swayed. There had been no attack.
   <p>After Dr. Allen stepped down, Dr. Slayton took the stand and
the questioning was brief. He told how he had gone to the board
meeting, stopped for a couple of drinks at Phaedo's and come home to
find his wife had been killed. Slayton was obviously suffering on the
stand and Herring was gentle with him.
   <p>Lt. Willis was next and he explained what had been done. The
victim's robe, dust from the scene, and fingerprints from all over the
house had been sent to the laboratory in Hartford. No clues had been
found in the robe or the dust and the fingerprints were still being
sorted. Further than that, extensive interviews had been conducted
and over seventy-five people had been questioned, not only those
acquainted or related to the deceased but all known criminals,
perverts, and sex-offenders in the area, everyone who had ever been
called to the attention of the police. Nothing conclusive had been
uncovered.
   <p>Star Slayton was at the inquest with her father, as was everyone
else on Terrace Lane, but she wasn't called upon for testimony about
the grey-haired man who looked like Joe Morgan and no mention was made
of a chauffeur named Gary James, nor of his pink smudged handkerchief.
Herring conducted the whole affair in as general a way as possible so
that the only statements definitely made revolved around the time,
place, cause, and victim of death. Anything to do with the
perpetration was left wide open so that Judge Mansfield could
pronounce the broadest decision of the court, to wit: <quote>The court
finds that Phyllis Slayton, n&eacute;e Wilson, was strangled to death by
hands and by sash in the living-room of her home on Terrace Lane
between the hours of nine and ten-thirty on the evening of August
third, nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, such death being at the hand
of person or persons unknown.</quote> Then he adjourned the inquest and
went into his chambers to pose for pictures with Herring.
   <p>As the crowd filed out of the torrid and stuffy auditorium, Camp
and Willis went back to the basement headquarters. The chief was
perspiring freely and he was grumbling, as he always grumbled, at such
red-tape phases of law-and-order as inquests.
   <p>A supernumerary was holding down the desk because all regular
patrolmen had been ordered to attend the inquest. He held up an
envelope and said, <quote>This came while you were upstairs.</quote>
   <p>It was a special delivery letter, made of an ordinary three-cent
stamped envelope with the fourth cent for first class mail and the
price of a special delivery made up by additional three cent stamps
with extra for good measure. It bore a Marshton postmark with the
time 9 a.m., and was addressed to: Chief of Police, Police
Headquarters, Marshton, Conn.
   <p>The address and the words <quote>special delivery</quote> had been typed on
the envelope by a battered old machine that had a piece missing from
the <quote>L</quote> and a badly worn and unaligned <quote>E</quote>.
   <p>Camp looked the envelope over briefly, then ripped it open and
pulled out the sheet inside. He unfolded it carefully, as though by
instinct not touching it with more than his fingertips.
   <p>Inside was a four-word sentence which read: <quote>Ralph Slayton
killed Phyllis.</quote>
<head>CHAPTER TEN</head>
   <p>CAMP read the note and frowned. Then, holding it by the
corners, he showed it to Willis and Shevlin. The lieutenant whistled
but Shevlin shook his head. <quote>There's one in every crowd,</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>One what?</quote>
   <p><quote>It sounds like a crank note.</quote>
   <p>Camp grinned. <quote>Kind of a funny note for a crank. Notice it
doesn't suggest Ralph might have killed his wife as a poison pen
writer usually does. This says he did kill his wife. The writer
talks as if he knew something we don't. He talks as if he'd seen it
happen.</quote>
   <p><quote>And,</quote> Willis agreed, <quote>as if he was afraid we were going to
send James up for it.</quote>
   <p>Shevlin stood alone. He said, <quote>I don't think Slayton did
it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Give me a reason,</quote> said Camp.
   <p><quote>He's alibied.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's an alibi we haven't checked yet. The writer of this note
might have been afraid we wouldn't check it.</quote>
   <p>Willis said, <quote>He doesn't know the State Police.</quote>
   <p><quote>Hell,</quote> said Camp. <quote>He doesn't even know the local force.
Here,</quote> he told the supernumerary. <quote>Go find a board and some
thumbtacks. I want Lieutenant Willis to take this to the lab.</quote>
   <p>The officer went out in search of the materials and Shevlin said,
<quote>Ralph went to a board meeting and stopped at a bar. He didn't get
home until twenty minutes past eleven and Phyllis wasn't killed any
later than ten-thirty. How's he going to lie about a thing like
that?</quote>
   <p><quote>It's funny about that bar,</quote> Camp said musingly. He sat down
at his desk and pulled out a black and acrid cigar from his shirt
pocket. He stared at it thoughtfully. <quote>Slayton didn't usually stop
at bars after meetings. Interesting that he happened to do so this
particular night.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's easy. He'd had a fight with his wife. He didn't want
to go right home.</quote>
   <p><quote>A violent fight,</quote> Willis put in. <quote>Very violent. It might
have picked up again after he returned.</quote>
   <p><quote>At eleven-twenty?</quote> Shevlin retorted. <quote>An hour after she was
dead?</quote>
   <p>Camp lighted his cigar. <quote>The good thing about your growing up
in this town is you have background,</quote> he said. <quote>The bad thing is
that it makes you prejudiced. Forget the time element, Shevlin.
Forget that for a minute.</quote> He puffed on the cigar in enjoyment.
<quote>A fight with Ralph could explain what she was doing in the
living-room.</quote>
   <p>Shevlin shook his head. <quote>Not from the way she was killed.</quote>
   <p><quote>Are you going to try to tell me that because Ralph Slayton
operates on hearts he couldn't strangle anybody?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not that way. Not from the arguments you give. Ralph might
strike Phyllis in a rage, or throttle her, or even kill her. But to
half throttle her and then knot a sash around her neck to finish the
job, that's not just rage.</quote>
   <p>Camp paused with his cigar in mid-air. He looked steadfastly at
Shevlin for a long moment. Finally he said to Willis, <quote>You know? I
thought the men I had to make into cops in this place were pretty
hopeless, but I take it back. I think the boy has a spark. I think
in time we might make him into a real detective.</quote>
   <p>It was about the first compliment Shevlin had got from Camp and
he couldn't help feeling flattered. <quote>Don't tell me I win a point?</quote>
   <p><quote>Hell, no,</quote> Camp said, lowering the boom. <quote>Don't go getting
a swelled head. One swallow doesn't make a drink. You come up with
one vague intangible in Slayton's favour and you think it eliminates
him as a suspect.</quote>
   <p><quote>He wasn't even a suspect until you got that note.</quote>
   <p><quote>Wasn't he?</quote> Camp grinned at Willis. <quote>We can spot
intangibles too, Shevlin. Don't you think the fact he and his wife
had a fight makes us perk up our ears? Don't you think we pay
attention when it's stated they fought all the time? Don't you think
we notice he never thinks his daughter might have been killed too?
<QUOTE>

<text id=LOBL19>
   <p><quote>You went down to the theatre to meet Ellam, and that puts you
right there, on the scene of the crime.</quote>
   <p>He smiled at her, and she saw his smile, and her eyes filled with
horror.
   <p><quote>No! It wasn't like that. I didn't go to the theatre &mdash; I can
prove it.</quote>
   <p>She was really frightened now, as she hadn't been before.
   <p><quote>I knew Roger was going to meet Susan, because I'd met her
myself that same morning, and she told me all about it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Didn't that make you wild?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, because Roger had often spoken to me about marrying her.</quote>
   <p><quote>For her money?</quote>
   <p>She drooped her head and looked at the wine glass, turning it
round in her fingers and letting it reflect the light. She said: <quote>I
wasn't wild, just miserable. I felt sort of helpless and perhaps a
little jealous. I decided to go for a walk to shake the feeling off.
I passed the end of the theatre drive, but I swear I didn't go in.
Roger was waiting there. He told me about his date with Susan, that
everything depended on it, and told me to keep away from the
theatre.</quote>
   <p><quote>He didn't say why?</quote>
   <p><quote>He just said it was dangerous, and might ruin everything.</quote>
   <p>She broke suddenly, and kept repeating that she didn't go inside
the theatre, in a sort of moaning voice.
   <p>We left without another word. At the door I looked back. She
was still playing with the wine glass and staring at the hearth.
Somebody should have painted her, just like that.
<head>Chapter Twenty-Six</head>
   <p>THE THEATRE building looked just as square and just as
plain as the first time, and the same shadows from trees swayed over
the brickwork like curious fingers. There was the same spring scent
of earth and woods, and the same feeling of remoteness, though one or
two people were about. A few boys drifted up the drive, the little
ones frisky and excited, the big ones with a certain condescending
tolerance. And the sight of them had the same effect on Shale it
always had &mdash; a kind of cynical contempt for the system that moulded
them.
   <p>Lights were on inside the theatre, and the windows curtained, but
after the warm evening, it was like going into a colder place. The
hall was about two-thirds full of boys. They kept bobbing up in their
seats, chewing. There was a happy anticipatory drone.
   <p>A prefect ushered us to our seats in the second row, and the
school orchestra in front began teetering nervously on their violins.
An amateurish air hung over the place like a pleasant infection.
   <p>From the cover of my programme, I saw we were in for what is
affectionately known as English middle-class comedy. I sat down and
studied the people in the front row.
   <p>Wylie's head was just to my right, and at close quarters, his
little grey waves looked thinner, like flimsy sponges on a pink sea
bed. His wife was wearing a hat I was glad I wasn't sitting behind.
She had played a gleam of triumph steadily on Shale as we came up the
row to our seats. When we sat down, her head snapped round to the
front. Wylie acknowledged us with a curt nod and a faint drawing in
of the eyebrows. He was rather subdued. It made him more human.
   <p>Miss Teale looked almost soft and yielding, not so prim. She had
a new defiance, and her eyes wandered round the hall confidently. She
was wearing her hair long, and it made her look younger. Her gaze
rested often on Carter, who was sitting with a bright smile next to my
uncle. He leaned across affably and said in a whisper, <quote>I say,
they've been looking for Ellam all evening. Apparently he's nowhere
to be found. Looks pretty mysterious don't you think?</quote>
   <p>I passed it on to Shale. He was reading his programme, and I
suddenly felt him nudge me. He was pointing out the names of the cast
and his finger was half way down the page. I read:
   <p><quote>Laura Thistledown, the manager's secretary... played by William
Barlow, 6 A.</quote>
   <p>He kept his finger there for my benefit and I saw what he meant.
The Christian name &mdash; <quote>Laura</quote>. It should have signified something
but my mind wouldn't grasp it. I gave him a puzzled glance, but he
was settled back in his seat, staring at the top of the stage. He was
sitting like that when the prefect shuffled up the row and whispered
in his ear. <quote>Willant wants a word with me,</quote> Shale said, and we all
went out. Heads turned, and there was a polite air of interest in the
front row.
   <p>Willant was in the entrance, a study of indecision.
   <p><quote>Ellam's nowhere to be found,</quote> he said. <quote>Nowhere in the
school.</quote>
   <p>His fingers strayed to his waistcoat, and he tugged nervously
like a man with a tricky point to make that was embarrassing him.
   <p>He said: <quote>In view of his behaviour this afternoon, I'm not
quite sure what I ought to do.</quote>
   <p>Shale said: <quote>You could tell the police.</quote>
   <p><quote>But as it's only two hours ago since he was here, it might look
premature to say he's disappeared. He might return. After all, he
was suffering from &mdash; perhaps a nervous breakdown &mdash; it might be unwise
to draw attention to it &mdash;</quote> He stopped, at a loss.
   <p><quote>It might be better to wait.</quote> Ambrose said, with the air of a
tactician who'd weighed everything up.
   <p><quote>You were pretty worried about him a while back, doctor,</quote>
Shale said. <quote><squote>Desperate</squote> I think was the word you used. You
should tell the police.</quote>
   <p><quote>No doubt you're right,</quote> Willant said weakly. <quote>But first I
must start the play, we're late as it is &mdash; so many things to think
of &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He made for the door in the hall, and stepped back as Forster
came the other way. Forster was wearing a stage-hand's smock. His
face was shining, and happier than I'd ever seen it. He looked
harassed when he saw us, but recovered, and said to Willant: <quote>No
sign of Mr. Ellam yet, headmaster. I really think we ought to
start.</quote>
   <p>Willant took off his glasses and rubbed them. He gave a sigh.
<quote>Very well, Mr. Forster. I'll just say a few words first.</quote> He
went in impulsively, glad to get away. Forster turned to follow him,
but Shale said, <quote>One thing before you go, Mr. Forster. The
character Laura Thistledown. Who was to play her the last time &mdash;
young Burnage?</quote>
   <p>Forster nodded, and began to look worried. <quote>That was all,</quote>
Shale said gently. <quote>You can start the revels now.</quote>
   <p>We went back to our seats, and Willant, who'd been talking to
Wylie moved to the front of the stage and held up his hands for
silence. The shuffling died away and he spoke his piece without any
trouble. He managed to sound informal and light-hearted, like a vicar
at a whist drive. When he'd finished, he walked down the hall and I
saw him go through the door at the back. I felt a certain admiration
for the way he was keeping going.
   <p>There was some polite applause, then the lights went out except
for a glow beneath the curtain, and blobs of light on the orchestra's
music stands. The overture was brief and chronic. Shale lit a
cigarette and relaxed, staring at the roof. The curtain opened on an
amateurish set with a french window looking out on to a cardboard
garden.
   <p>It was slow getting underway, and the actors were elocution
conscious, but it went down well with the audience. There was a lot
of laughter, most of it at the expense of the actors, especially
Currie playing a middle-aged matron with a large lop-sided bosom.
   <p>The first act lasted some twenty minutes, and in the interval I
watched the reactions of the staff. Miss Teale's eyes were shining
happily. Once she flashed me a smile &mdash; quite a becoming smile. Wylie
had unbent a little, and was trying to give the impression of a stern
man reflecting that a little nonsense was all right once in a while
for boys. His wife was telling someone in a loud voice that so-and-so
was good, and so-and-so wasn't quite so good. Her standards were
absolute. Carter was frankly in tucks about the whole thing.
   <p>Shale seemed half asleep. Once, during the scene, he had watched
Miss Teale for a long time, but his eyes had mostly been examining the
top of the curtain, as if he were looking beyond, and trying to
picture the dust and the gallery and the wooden platform.
   <p>The lights went down again, and I saw Willant come back. I
wondered if he had informed the police.
   <p>A sudden gasp of hilarious delight made me look at the stage.
The character Laura Thistledown had made her first entrance. She was
meant to be pert and pretty, and something of a charmer. The boy
playing the part wore a slim black costume, a dinky hat, and wobbled
slightly on four-inch heels. He had a wig of blonde curls, and that
made me think of the wig that was still missing, and that made me
think of the green costume that was also missing, and I looked at
Shale. He was sitting forward, watching the play intently. I felt a
rise of excitement.
   <p>There was some by-play going on on the stage. The idea seemed to
be that <quote>Laura Thistledown</quote> was vamping the goofy nephew of the
local aristocracy &mdash; a part played with gusto by a boy having trouble
with a pencil-line moustache. Suddenly this young blood took the
secretary in his arms, and said in an anguish of embarrassment: <quote>Oh,
Laura! You're exactly like the other girl.</quote>
   <p>The audience twittered with delight. I felt Shale stiffen and
then relax, very slowly. He gripped my arm, and began to write
something on the back of his programme. It couldn't have been easy in
the dark, but he wrote quickly. On the stage they were still fooling
about, and the audience was making happy noises, but I wasn't with
them any more.
   <p>Shale spoke in a low voice. <quote>Read it outside &mdash; three important
questions there. Go right away in the car, and put them to the
servant, Mrs. Olroyd. Got it?</quote>
   <p>I went as quietly as I could, but it seemed to me I made a lot of
noise. Ambrose looked annoyed as I squeezed past him, but I didn't
stop to explain.
   <p>Outside I sat in the car, put a cigarette in my mouth, and read
the programme in the falling light.
   <p>It wasn't easy to make out, some of Shale's writing had run
across the print, but I finally got it. Three questions, that was
all. Just three questions. Put them to a nice old servant who had
done her job well until one day she'd been sacked, and you would get
three answers. You had to get three answers because there could only
be three answers and they would make sense of everything.
   <p>I lit the cigarette, and sat there and smelt the scents from the
wood, and watched the branches sway in the breeze, and listened to the
evening song of a solitary bird, and everything was suddenly clear.
The green costume and everything.
   <p>I reached for the starter and checked my hand. Someone had just
come from the theatre. I heard steps hurrying down the drive. I
listened until they crunched away into silence, then I started the
car. I thought I'd see who it was as I passed, but there was nobody
on the drive. Whoever it was must have taken to the woods.
   <p>It took me half an hour or so to get there, and she was in with
the old lady. I put the questions, and she answered them placidly.
It didn't mean much to her, and I was neither relieved nor excited &mdash;
I just knew what she would say.
   <p>It was nearly dark when I got back to the Curlew.

<head>FOLLOW THE TOFF</head>
   <p>IT was not the first time that the Honourable Richard
Rollison had been followed. It would not be the last. It had
happened in many cities, and more than once before in this fair city
of Paris in the Spring. It had happened by day and by night, on land,
on sea and in the air. Rollison himself, if challenged, would have
said that he believed that every possible variation of the theme had
been developed, yet on this day in May he knew that he had been wrong.
   <p>It was the first time that such beauty had followed him.
   <p>The beauty was undoubtedly English, although he had not yet heard
her speak. She had that curiously indefinable quality, perhaps more
rightly air, about her. It was not only the supreme simplicity of her
black and white check suit, the coat short-waisted, the skirt just
long enough to be in fashion, and to show most of the shapeliness of
her legs. Nor was it those long, slim legs, or her height &mdash; five feet
eight or nine he judged &mdash; or her complexion, although undoubtedly her
complexion had something to do with it.
   <p>It was a little bit of everything.
   <p>She had followed him from the Caf&eacute; de Paris, of which it
was said that if one sat long enough one would meet all the rest of
the world; in fact at the Caf&eacute; de Paris he had first realised
that she had been interested in him. She had walked past the long
lines of wicker tables and chairs, most of them empty. The glass
screens of winter had been whisked away and the spring sunshine not
only made life serene but almost made it possible to forget the
surging traffic, the growl and snarl of engines, the bark and clatter
of taxis, the all-pervading stench of petrol fumes mingling with even
worse from diesel oil. As Rollison had sat over late petit
d&eacute;jeuner, wondering why the French who made the world's worst
coffee had a reputation for making it so well, and why the English,
who made the world's best, were supposed to make the worst, the woman
had walked past. She had looked at him and then walked quickly away.
He had not been in a hurry, however; such grace and slenderness and
beauty were all too rare. He watched her go, a little pensive because
he doubted whether he would ever have an excuse to meet her, perhaps
not even to see her again. But soon she had turned back from the
corner by the Place de l'Op&eacute;ra. That in itself had not been
unusual; people often walked as far as that, and then turned back.
This time Rollison pretended to take no notice of her, but observed
that she stared intently at him, and looked back at him several times.
   <p>By then, Rollison's interest had become much stronger. For one
thing, he realised just how remarkable the woman was to look at, and
remarkable women could usually make his heart beat a little faster.
For another thing, he was beginning to feel sure that she had
recognised him and wanted to talk but could not summon up the
courage &mdash; if courage was the word.
   <p>He could make it easy for her, or make it comparatively hard. He
would have made it easy but for the little man.
   <p>This little man was almost certainly the man who had swindled
Alice Day, who was now on her way to Australia. He fitted Mike's
description to a T, and he spent some time at stations, outside
night-clubs and other tourist haunts, offering money at a good rate of
exchange. Only a few people seemed to deal with him, and Rollison
planned to catch him red-handed with forged notes. Now this same man
was following the Englishwoman, and Rollison did not try to guess
whether she knew it or not. If she knew, she was taking no notice &mdash;
unless, of course, awareness of the surveillance of the little man
kept her from approaching Rollison boldly.
   <p>It was a mildly intriguing situation, and quite entertaining; it
would have been amusing but for the woman's obvious anxiety. Beauty
in distress was never even remotely comic. An ordinary man, assessing
the situation as Rollison assessed it, would almost certainly have
found an excuse to talk to the woman, and might possibly have tried to
shoo the little man off. There were times when Rollison &mdash; known as
the Toff to the police of seven continents and to the criminals of
six, would have taken such direct action, but this was not one of
them. He had two reasons for being intrigued: his Aunt Gloria's two
hundred pounds, and this beauty.
   <p>At ten minutes to eleven the woman was some way along the
Boulevard des Capucines in the direction of the Madeleine, and the
little man was fifty yards behind her. Every motor car in Paris
seemed to be crammed into the road which had seemed wide in the days
of horse carriages.
   <p>Rollison called for his bill, paid, and allowed himself to be
swept across the road with a surge of human beings all racing to make
sure that they reached the opposite pavement before the roaring
monsters of iron and steel were unleashed at the whirl of a gendarme's
white baton or a trill on his hidden whistle. Once on the far side,
Rollison watched the woman, and he was tall enough to see and be seen
without difficulty. When he was sure that she had spotted him, he
discontinued a tentative interest in a window which exhibited every
refinement of feminine foundation in black, pink, and pale mauve silk,
and strolled towards the Madeleine. The woman walked in the same
direction on the other side of the road. She followed him along the
street opposite the church of the mammoth pillars towards the arid
wastes of the Place de la Concorde, and then by devious dangerous
routes towards the Seine. Now and again Rollison made sure that not
only the woman but the little man was behind him. Then, as if at a
loose end, he crossed to the Rue de Rivoli and became one of the
thousands of tourists promenading beneath the arches and seduced by a
million model Eiffel Towers and a thousand Joan of Arcs. The woman
drew closer. Rollison dawdled. He thought that this time she would
speak, for she actually passed within a yard of him. He imagined that
he could hear her breathing agitatedly &mdash; but she passed without
stopping.
   <p>Rollison continued to study a window resplendent in Arab
leatherwork and Moroccan silver, as the little man drew nearer.
   <p>This little man was quite remarkable too. The task of following
an individual through a city the size of Paris is not easy even for
those people physically adapted to it, but he was only about five feet
two inches high. Heads and shoulders of all sizes, chests and bosoms
of all shapes, arms and even hands got in his way, but doggedly he
kept on the trail. He wasn't remarkable in any other way; in fact he
was the type who could easily get lost in a crowd. Rollison judged
him to be French, not only because he was blue-jowled and wore a
slightly faded beret, but because he chain-smoked Skol cigarettes;
only a Frenchman could have such hardihood and courage. He had a
pinched nose which looked as if it had been pushed to one side, and a
little bloodless mouth, a surprisingly square and thrusting chin, and
a well cut brown suit; the beret did not quite match up to this. He
wore suede shoes too of dark brown, a shade darker than the brown of
his suit. All of this Mike had described very well.
   <p>The woman had gone by. The little Frenchman was following.
Rollison judged his moment, and stepped into the little man's path.
There was a ridiculous contretemps of dither and dart, as if each man
was trying to give way to the other, but in fact Rollison did not mean
to give way until the moment was right. So they collided. A woman
gasped: ~<quote>Oo!</quote> as only someone born in Blackpool could. The little
man reeled back, as if dazed. Rollison gave a dazzling smile and
apologised, and allowed the man to pass. Then, watched by at least a
dozen people, he darted his left hand towards the inside of his coat
pocket. Every Method school of acting would have approved his
performance. He looked startled, aghast, appalled, angry, and finally
vengeful. Then in the clearest and loudest of English he called:
   <p><quote>Stop thief!</quote>
   <p>Fifty people looked round, mostly English and American all
open-mouthed, some ready to fling themselves forward with great
courage, most trying to make sure that they could get out of the way.
<quote>Stop thief!</quote> cried Rollison again, and moved with astonishing
rapidity through the crowd towards the little Frenchman, who had not
hurried and had not looked round. The Englishwoman was now staring at
those massed gilt models of the Eiffel Tower, the Notre Dame, and Joan
of Arc on a gilded statue, the original of which was only a hundred
yards away.
   <p>Rollison pounced on him, gripped his shoulder, and spun him
round. The man gaped. A gendarme standing in the roadway trilled on
his whistle, swung his baton and charged forward. A crowd collected,
most of them people at a safe distance, but one sturdy Yorkshireman
and his wife came to Rollison's support.
   <p><quote>Is that reet?</quote> the Yorkshireman demanded. <quote>Did he take
summat out of thy pocket?</quote>
   <p><quote>The scoundrel stole my wallet,</quote> asserted Rollison, and as he
spoke the gendarme came up and rested a hand on the butt of his
revolver, warningly, and machine-gunned a dozen questions.
   <p><quote>I don't understand a word you're saying,</quote> lied Rollison
hotly. <quote>This man pretended to collide with me just now, and stole my
wallet.</quote>
   <p><quote>That is not so,</quote> declared the little man, in highly accented
English. <quote>Eet is the big lie.</quote>
   <p>The gendarme demanded, in French, to know what exactly had
happened. Rollison tapped his pocket, thrust his hand inside, drew it
out empty, and declared:
   <p><quote>He &mdash; stole &mdash; my &mdash; wallet.</quote>
   <p>That &mdash; ees &mdash; the &mdash; lie.</quote>
   <p><quote>M'sieu, je demande que vous parlez Francais.</quote>
   <p><quote>He stole &mdash; </quote>
   <p>The little man turned to the gendarme and poured out an earnest,
even an impassioned denial &mdash; he had not touched Rollison's wallet, he
had not touched Rollison. He was a law-abiding citizen, he was not to
be insulted, he &mdash;
   <p><quote>He stole my wallet!</quote> roared Rollison.
   <p><quote>Eeeh, lad, better leave it to me,</quote> said the Yorkshireman and
began to talk in surprisingly colloquial French in spite of an
unbelievable admixture of Yorkshire accent. Even the little man was
silenced, and the gendarme appeared to begin to understand. As the
Yorkshireman finished, the gendarme held his baton at the ready and
spoke with the air of a Solomon:
   <p><quote>If this man stole your wallet, he will have it with him now.</quote>
   <p>Rollison just saved himself from agreeing in French and asked the
Yorkshireman:
   <p><quote>What's all the blathering about?</quote>
   <p><quote>He says that if this man stole tha wallet he'd still have it
on him.<quote>
   <p><quote>Fair enough,</quote> agreed Rollison. <quote>So why not search him?</quote>
   <p><quote>You look, you see &mdash; nothing,</quote> declared the little
Frenchman. He gripped the edges of his coat, and flung it open at
arms' length, as if he hoped to be able to take off and fly with these
homemade wings. He was undoubtedly convinced that the wallet was not
there, perhaps because he had never met Rollison before. The gendarme
stared, the Yorkshireman gaped and glanced with earthy satisfaction at
Rollison. A dozen other people craned forward to see Rollison's
crocodile leather wallet showing fully an inch above the Frenchman's
pocket.
   <p><quote>Eeeh, lad,</quote> said the Yorkshireman, <quote>tha'd best leave
talking to me. Just tell me where thou 'rt staying and I'll talk
to copper for thee.</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't know what I would have done without you,</quote> said
Rollison warmly.

<head>Concluding chapters of a great mystery novel</head>
<head>That long wet summer</head>
<head>by JOAN AIKEN</head>
   <p>They told her their insane plan &mdash; gloating and triumphant &mdash;
trying to force her hand...
<head>The story so far:</head>
   <p>JANE DRUMMOND was trying to keep her marriage together &mdash; for
the sake of her children, CAROLINE and DONALD. Her architect
husband, GRAHAM, was selfish and self-centred, living above his
income to <quote>keep up appearances.</quote> He encouraged her to return to
work while MYFANWY MACGREGOR was engaged to look after the
children. Myfanwy and her husband TIM, seemed to have some hold
over Graham.
   <p>Living near the Drummonds was TOM ROLAND, a TV celebrity
Jane once met at a party, whom Graham tried to cultivate because Tom
was famous. Jane was driven home from the station each night by Tom
and their friendship grew. She suspected that Mrs. MacGregor &mdash; whom
she was beginning to detest &mdash; could not read or write and was
horrified when she found an anonymous letter in Caroline's
handwriting. The note was for Graham and read: YOUR WIFE IS
CARRYING ON WITH MR. ROLAND.
   <p>Between the MacGregors and her strained relationship with
Graham, Jane's life became unbearable. She was pleased when her old
friend, ELLIE came to stay &mdash; but surprised to see that Ellie and
Tom obviously knew each other, though neither admitted this.
   <p>Then Ellie &mdash; a scatter-brained blonde &mdash; told Jane she was
pregnant. Jane promised to help all she could &mdash; and to adopt the
child. Tim MacGregor tried to kiss Jane &mdash; and for a second she
mistook him for Graham.
   <p>Later, in their bedroom, she told Graham the MacGregors must go.
<quote>I'm terrified of them,</quote> she said. <quote>You're terrified?</quote>
Graham answered. <quote>What do you think I am? Jane, do you know who
that man is?</quote>
   <p>Now read on:
   <p>
   <p><quote>NO, of course I don't know who MacGregor is,</quote> Jane
said, trembling. <quote>How could I? Who is he?</quote>
   <p><quote>He's my cousin,</quote> Graham said.
   <p><quote>Your cousin? Then that's why &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>He used to live in Tangier,</quote> Graham went on, ignoring her.
<quote>It was he who suggested I should go out there. He had a factory &mdash;
a makeshift hole, in a tin shed, making plastic doorknobs,</quote> he added
with a sour smile, seeing Jane's look of incredulity. <quote>But for all
that, Tim's a clever chap. Doorknobs weren't his main line. He had
quite a nice sideline in penicillin and black market machine oil.</quote>
   <p>Things began to fall into place in Jane's mind.
   <p><quote>And you helped him?</quote>
   <p><quote>Only occasionally.</quote> Graham's voice was angry, defensive.
<quote>Only when clients weren't biting. At first it was all okay. Then
there was a bit of trouble.</quote>
   <p>The curtain blew in above Jane's head and she heard a volley of
rain spatter on the window-sill. I ought to get up and shut the
window, she thought, and lay still, thinking of how she had first met
Graham in Tangier &mdash; the hot sun, the white roofs, the charming things
he had said. Now it seemed like some twopence-coloured fairy-tale.
   <p><quote>I was helping him at that time,</quote> Graham said. <quote>The profits
were going to be rather good. But someone had used a batch of Tim's
oil for making salad cream or something, and a lot of people had died.
Things had been tightened up and they were on the lookout. We were
followed into Spanish Morocco and we had to get away fast from the
rendezvous. There was a bit of shooting and Tim got hit. We &mdash; I
thought he was killed. There wasn't time to make sure.</quote>
   <p><quote>What happened to him?</quote>
   <p><quote>We had to leave him behind and he was picked up. He was sent
to jail for three years. Quite a short sentence really. So I decided
the game wasn't worth the risk. It was rather a murky business,</quote>
Graham said with a flicker of his normal self-righteousness. <quote>And it
was just after that I met you, so I opted out and decided to come home
and set up as a law-abiding citizen.</quote>
   <p><quote>I see.</quote> Jane turned away from him, willing herself to ask
the next question.
   <p><quote>Graham, that legacy from your uncle in Scotland &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Well?</quote> His voice was wary.
   <p><quote>Was it really the profits from that &mdash; that consignment?</quote> His
silence said yes.
   <p><quote>Why did you lie to me about it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, damn it, I hardly knew you. I couldn't very well have
told you a thing like that then.</quote> He was injured. <quote>You
thought the world of me.</quote>
   <p>And so you did of me, Jane thought, with a sudden,
uncharacteristically hard perception. I was broke and in a dreary
job; just the same, Daddy and I had something you hadn't got that you
needed on your climb up the ladder. Needed as much as a new house, or
a gardener, or Tom Roland's mower.
   <p><quote>And MacGregor &mdash; what happened to his share of the profit?</quote>
Jane asked.
   <p><quote>For the Lord's sake, Jane, must we go over all this? It's
ancient history now and I'm tired, I want to go to sleep. I've got
enough to worry about; all I ask is that you don't antagonize Tim and
his wife.</quote>
   <p><quote>You took his share, is that it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, what else could I do?</quote> said Graham sulkily. <quote>It
didn't amount to much, anyway, and there was no one to leave it with.
Naturally, I thought when he came out I'd have done well enough to
pay him back. It was just bad luck I couldn't.</quote>
   <p><quote>Where was his wife while he was in prison?</quote>
   <p><quote>In Wales with her family.</quote>
   <p>Jane knew that she ought to feel pity for the MacGregors, but she
thought of Tim's cunning sidelong look, his wife's hostile air of
concealed knowledge, and could find nothing but loathing.
   <p><quote>We'll have to sell the house,</quote> she said. <quote>Sell it and pay
him what he thinks you owe him and move away from here.</quote>
   <p><quote>Are you mad?</quote> Graham said with violence. <quote>Sell this place?
Just when I've got it finished? Just when we're making some useful
friends? I'll pay Tim off somehow; it's just a matter of time. All
we have to do is keep him quiet for a bit. He can't really do
anything.</quote>
   <p>He spoke with the old confidence that had once sounded so
reassuring to Jane. Now she knew how much it was worth.
   <p><quote>But Graham &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Stop nagging, stop nagging,</quote> he said with passionate
irritation, and turned towards her, holding her in a tense, nervous
grip. His voice changed. <quote>Just let's forget about it all, shall
we?</quote> Jane was used to these sudden exigencies of Graham's desire
when the world had gone against him. Long after he was sleeping, one
arm flung possessively across her, she lay awake, staring at the
greying sky, while slow, cold tears trickled backwards into the roots
of her hair.
   <p>
   <p>JANE made Ellie stay in bed until after lunch next day,
hoping an affectionate smile and the Sunday papers would serve as
sufficient evidence of sympathy until she had gathered herself
together. To listen with constructive attention to Ellie's problem
was more than she could manage just yet.
   <p>Graham went out immediately after breakfast and was absent all
morning. When Jane collected Ellie's tray after lunch, Caroline went
with her and stayed chatting to Ellie while she dressed. Ellie was
devoted to the children and began brushing Caroline's hair and tying
it in ribbons. Then she offered to take Caroline and Donald for a
walk.
   <p>Jane thankfully accepted, put the baby in his pram and saw them
off. She thought she would go to church; that might clear her
thoughts and bring her to a decision.
   <p>Graham, who had come back just before lunch and been completely
silent through the meal, walked into their bedroom as she was putting
on a hat.
   <p><quote>I want Ellie out of here by tonight,</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>She's not going.</quote> Jane's tone was firm, light; she stooped
over a drawer, rummaging for gloves. Graham was obviously at a loss
before her unexpected mood. At last, angry and irresolute &mdash; <quote>You'll
be sorry for this...</quote> he muttered and turned on his heel. She could
hear his steps, heavy and defeated, dragging down the stairs.
   <p>Something made her look out of the window. MacGregor had arrived
and was wheeling the mower out on to the lawn. His wife had installed
herself on a rug with Susan.
   <p>The active force of her own hate startled Jane.
   <p>She went into the garden. MacGregor had paused to say something
to his wife and Jane was able to address them both.
   <p><quote>I understand I've been doing you an injustice,</quote> she said
coldly. <quote>Naturally, if I'd realized that my husband owed you money
it would have been different. However, now I have found out it
makes it easier to say this. I don't want ever to see either of you
again. I shall get a full-time job and pay you back myself, if
necessary. But if you pester Graham or send any more anonymous
messages about me I shall go straight to the police.
   <p><quote>I'm going to afternoon service now and when I come back I shall
expect to find that you've packed up your things and gone.</quote>
   <p>She walked on without waiting for an answer, leaving four
malevolent eyes fixed on her back. A feeble sun was trying to shine.
Little Susan, sitting in a patch of sand on the drive, raised an
indifferent, vacant face to her, and Jane shuddered, seeing suddenly a
resemblance to Caroline. This child was her cousin!
   <p>There were few people in the church. Jane, at first hardly able
to follow the service, presently found herself calmer.
   <p>The office will take me on full time, she decided hopefully, and
I'm sure Ellie can be persuaded to look after the children for a bit.
If I contribute all my salary to pay the MacGregors, Graham will
surely agree.
   <p>She ignored a small warning voice that said: Leave Graham. Take
the children and get away while you can, before you get dragged in any
deeper.
   <p>For a brief moment she considered asking advice of the vicar, the
kind old man who had christened Donald. But the story was not hers
alone. It was Graham's, MacGregor's, even Ellie's. The MacGregors
might be a repellent pair, but they had a right to the money Graham
owed them; it was not for her to be sanctimonious about how they had
come by it. And Ellie &mdash; she had promised to help Ellie and would not
run out on her now.
   <p>Tom, she thought. If only I could have asked Tom's advice. But
now it's too late for that.
   <p>
   <p>WHEN she walked home after the service, it was raining
hard. She had no coat with her, and hurried up the village street,
head bent against the cold, driving gusts.
   <p><quote>Ellie!</quote> she called, as soon as she was inside the house.
<quote>Shut the bathroom window, will you? The rain always comes in on
that side.</quote>
   <p>There was no answer. Were Ellie and the children not back from
their walk yet? They would be soaked.
   <p>She went into the sitting-room &mdash; and stopped short. The
MacGregors were there, Tim lounging on the piano stool, Susan on the
floor, Mrs. MacGregor upright and expressionless on the sofa.
   <p><quote>I told you to leave this house,</quote> Jane said.
   <p><quote>Oh, madam,</quote> Tim said softly, <quote>you wouldn't expect us to
leave in this rain, would you?</quote> His narrow black eyes slid past
her, rested on his wife, came back to Jane again.
   <p><quote>Graham!</quote> Jane called. There was no reply. Apart from
herself and the MacGregors, the house appeared to be empty. A fear
began to take hold of Jane. <quote>Graham!</quote> she called again.
   <p><quote>He was out sunbathing,</quote> MacGregor said, smiling. <quote>Very keen
he is on getting brown. He went out to get a good tan. I shouldn't
wonder but what he's still there. Asleep maybe.</quote>
   <p>He nodded down the garden, and Jane's disbelieving eyes saw
something on the sloping lawn &mdash; a round blob &mdash; Graham's head? Was he
lying on the grass in the pelting rain? She flung open the french
windows and ran over the sodden grass, calling frantically, <quote>Graham!
Graham!</quote>

<head>WHISPERING TONGUES BLAMED HER</head>
   <p>WHEN BOB ARCHER'S wife ANNE, disappears, the police
believe it is because she is guilty of poisoning Bob's mother.
Actually, however, she is being held prisoner by VERA CORBETT,
Mrs ARCHER'S ex-maid. It was Vera who killed Bob's mother and
she knows Anne can give her away. ARTHUR HEDLEY, Vera's
boy-friend, also knows of her guilt, but he is too deeply involved to
back out.
   <p>It is a shock to Vera when she discovers that the old house where
she is keeping Anne is not uninhabited, as she believed, but is
occupied by an old man and his housekeeper. And the grounds are
guarded by a pair of fierce dogs, so there is no escape. Luckily,
however, the old man seldom comes near the wing where Vera is hiding
Anne and has no idea they are there.
   <p>One day when he does come he leaves behind a local paper.
Studying it casually Vera sees she has been left &pound;2000 in Mrs
Archer's will.
   <p><quote>Two thousand pounds!</quote> she gasps turning to look down at Anne.
<quote>It's a fortune! I'm getting out of here, no matter what happens to
you!</quote>
   <p>Now Read On.
   <p>
   <p>VERA stared at the paper, her brain reeling. Two thousand
pounds!
   <p>Already her mind was racing. When you came to think of it, what
was there to stop her turning up to claim the money? The police had
nothing on her, especially now Anne was out of the way.
   <p>There were all sorts of difficulties to overcome, of course.
First, there was the problem of getting out of the house. Second,
the question of what she could do with Anne. Finally, how was she
going to explain to the police why she had disappeared?
   <p>The second and third snags she pushed aside for the moment. She
would find some way round them when the time came. She'd come back
for Anne and hide her somewhere else. She'd think of some story to
tell the police.
   <p>But getting out of the house unseen &mdash; that baffled her. Those
two bull terriers were never out of the garden and it was easy to see
how savage they were. Why, whenever a tradesman called at the door,
look how they raced round, snarling and barking until he went away
again.
   <p>Then suddenly Vera caught her breath. That was her answer!
   <p>Next time a tradesman came!
   <p>Sometimes he would be there for three or four minutes. If she
was quick, if she opened a downstairs window the moment the dogs
rushed round to snarl at the tradesman, if she ran as fast as she
could to the railway embankment, she might do it!
   <p>With sudden decision she began to bind and gag Anne.
   <p><quote>I'll be back for you &mdash; later.</quote> She gave a mirthless laugh.
<quote>You won't be very comfortable, but you'll be safe enough for
twenty-four hours.</quote>
   <p>In her dull, dazed way, Anne didn't even try to struggle.
   <p>Without a backward glance, Vera tiptoed downstairs to wait. When
it came to the bit, every second would count.
   <p>She slipped the catch off one window and stood waiting
impatiently.
   <p>It seemed hours before her chance came. The dogs began to bark
furiously, but the sound died away as they raced round to the other
side of the house. Vera threw up the window and scrambled out, racing
blindly towards the fence at the foot of the garden.
   <p>Seconds later, panting, her coat torn and her hands bleeding, she
tumbled to safety on the other side.
   <p>She lay for a full minute, getting her breath back. But there
was triumph in her heart. She'd made it!
   <p>She straightened presently and dusted herself down. Then she
stumbled along the embankment till she reached a point right beside
the main Mardsley road. There she caught a bus that would take her
right into Mardsley.
   <p>It was later than Vera had realised &mdash; nearly midday &mdash; but that
suited her well enough. Before she went to the police station she
wanted to have a word with Arthur Hedley. Then, if the police did
hold her for questioning, Arthur could do something about getting Anne
away from that house.
   <p>The bus dropped her almost opposite the factory where Arthur
worked. The rest was easy, just a matter of waiting in the shadow of
a doorway until the men began to trickle out.
   <p>Presently Arthur came out. He was alone.
   <p><quote>Arthur.</quote> She spoke his name very quietly.
   <p>He spun round. <quote>Vera!</quote> His eyes darted uneasily up and down
the street. <quote>Cross over, quick!</quote> he muttered.
   <p>
   <p>It must come now &mdash; the showdown between Anne Vardon and her
greatest enemy.
   <p>
   <p><quote>We'll go to Church Walk &mdash; there won't be anyone about.</quote>
   <p>They walked quickly, not speaking until they got to the deserted
lane. Then Arthur wheeled on her sharply.
   <p><quote>Why have you come here? How did &mdash;?</quote>
   <p><quote>Take it easy. I had to come back when I discovered about the
money.</quote>
   <p><quote>You know that?</quote> he gasped. <quote>But how?</quote>
   <p><quote>Never mind that just now. Just listen carefully. I told you
where Anne and I were hiding. Well, I got out, but I had to leave her
behind. But we've got to get her away to some other place as soon as
we can.</quote>
   <p><quote>But what about the dogs? You said &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>We can throw them some poisoned meat. But there's just one
thing. You'll have to go alone if the police hold me for
questioning.</quote>
   <p><quote>The police!</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't be a fool, Arthur!</quote> she said sharply. <quote>I can't claim
the money without seeing the police. I'm on my way there now.</quote>
   <p>He stared at her. <quote>You'll never get away with it!</quote>
   <p><quote>Why not?</quote> she asked coolly. <quote>The police haven't anything on
me. The only danger is if you lose your head and do anything silly.
Now off you go. If the police don't keep me I'll be waiting for you
when you finish tonight.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>VERA CORBETT knew now just what she was going to tell the
police. It was gloriously simple with Anne out of the way and unable
to contradict her.
   <p>All the same, her heart was beating a little faster with
nervousness as she walked up the steps of the police station.
   <p>As it happened, Detective-Sergeant Willis was with the desk
sergeant when she went in. He glanced idly round and stiffened
sharply.
   <p><quote>You!</quote> he gasped. Then he recovered himself a little.
<quote>Would you mind stepping into my room?</quote>
   <p>Apparently completely at ease, she watched him close the door
carefully behind them.
   <p><quote>Now then.</quote> He turned to face her. <quote>Where have you been?
Why did you go away?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've been in London.</quote> She gave him the address where she
really had stayed. <quote>But if you want to know why I went there, you'll
have to ask Anne Archer. It was her idea.</quote>
   <p>The detective frowned. <quote>Her idea? What are you driving at?</quote>
   <p><quote>She paid me to go and live there under another name. Don't ask
me why. She was paying good money, so I didn't ask too many
questions. Besides, there was no reason why I shouldn't go. I'd
quarrelled with my boy friend, and I wasn't happy at home. So I just
went like she asked me to, and told nobody.</quote>
   <p>He was staggered. <quote>But &mdash; good heavens, you must have some idea
why she asked you to do a thing like that!</quote>
   <p>She shook her head. <quote>I tell you I didn't ask many questions.</quote>
   <p>It was such an incredible story that it rang completely true &mdash;
because Willis thought he knew the answer to his own question. All
the same...
   <p><quote>I suppose it never occurred to you that you were reported
missing?</quote> he said sharply. <quote>Didn't you read the papers?</quote>
   <p>She shrugged. <quote>I've never been one for reading newspapers. I
mean, the London ones. It's different with local ones.</quote>
   <p>He swore softly under his breath. <quote>What brought you back,
then?</quote>
   <p><quote>Anne Archer stopped sending me money, so I decided to come and
see her.</quote>
   <p><quote>Anne Archer stopped sending you money? That's why you came
back? When did she stop?</quote> He shot the questions at her.
   <p><quote>About a week ago.</quote>
   <p>He nodded slowly. It all fitted. <quote>But why come to me?</quote> he
asked sharply.
   <p><quote>When I got here I bought a local paper. I read how old Mrs
Archer had died and left me some money.</quote> She smiled at him
innocently. <quote>I couldn't believe my eyes at first. But I thought the
best thing to do was come and see you. I knew you'd tell me what to
do.</quote>
   <p>He was silent a moment. <quote>Did you know that Anne Archer accused
you of trying to poison her mother-in-law?</quote>
   <p><quote>Me?</quote> Vera pretended to be completely staggered. Then anger
came into her face. <quote>What a dreadful thing to say! How could she!
What possible reason could I have?</quote>
   <p><quote>There's the money Mrs Archer left you in her will,</quote> he
pointed out sharply.
   <p><quote>Don't be silly! That will wasn't made until after I'd gone
away!</quote>
   <p>Willis fairly pounced on that. <quote>How do you know?</quote>
   <p><quote>Because I witnessed all the other wills she ever made,</quote> Vera
said simply. <quote>And I read them all.</quote> Her face darkened again.
<quote>Just wait till I see Anne Archer! She can't get away with saying
things like that!</quote>
   <p><quote>Anne Archer has disappeared,</quote> he said quietly.
   <p><quote>Disappeared!</quote> Once again she looked staggered. <quote>But why on
earth &mdash;</quote> And then she broke off, catching her breath. <quote>Don't you
see?</quote> she breathed. <quote>It all fits in! She sent me to London so she
could accuse me of trying to kill the old lady! Then for some reason
she got the wind up and cleared out.</quote>
   <p>That was exactly what Willis had been thinking, too.
   <p><quote>Very well.</quote> His voice was a little weary. <quote>You can go, but
I'll want you again.</quote>
   <p><quote>I can go?</quote> Vera echoed indignantly. <quote>What do you mean? I
came here of my own free will, and don't you forget it. I told you I
came to ask you what I should do about claiming the money.</quote>
   <p>Briefly he explained what she must do, then saw her out.
   <p>Vera walked down the street more confident than ever.
   <p>
   <p>WILLIS had said nothing to her about going to see Bob
Archer. But the first place she made for was his home. She reasoned
that it would be the natural thing for her to do if she really had
been innocent.
   <p>Bob gasped when he saw her. <quote>Vera! Where on earth have you
come from?</quote>
   <p><quote>I heard about your trouble, Mr Archer,</quote> she said quietly.
<quote>I mean about your mother's death and the way your wife has
disappeared. I &mdash; I just thought I'd like to say how sorry I am.</quote>
   <p>He looked at her sharply. <quote>But where have you been? What made
you come back? Did you read about my mother leaving you money?</quote>
   <p>She shook her head. <quote>Not till I got back to Mardsley!</quote>
   <p><quote>Then why did you come?</quote>
   <p>She hesitated. <quote>I &mdash; I don't really like to tell you,</quote> she
said reluctantly. <quote>It was easier to tell the police.</quote>
   <p>But she did tell him all the same. Bob listened in silence, his
face strained. But when she finished his eyes were hard.
   <p><quote>These are very grave accusations you're making, Vera,
especially as my wife isn't here to defend herself!</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't care!</quote> Vera said hotly. <quote>How dare she accuse me of
poisoning your mother?</quote> Her voice softened. <quote>Oh, Mr Archer, I
don't want to hurt your feelings at a time like this, but there's a
lot I could tell you.</quote> She pursed her lips. <quote>She's a bad one.
Look at the names she called your mother &mdash; the things she even said
about you behind your back. You'd never believe &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>That's enough!</quote> he cut in harshly.
   <p><quote>I don't care!</quote> Vera repeated angrily. <quote>I know Anne Vardon
better than you do, even if she is your wife. Don't forget who
she is! Remember what her father was!</quote>
   <p>Bob's jaw tightened. <quote>I think you've said quite enough,</quote> he
said harshly. <quote>You'd better go now.</quote>
   <p>She shrugged and turned on her heel.

<head>Short Story by HUMPHREY \ap EVANS</head>
<head>The Assessor</head>
   <p><quote>YES,</quote> said Mr. Ridley, taking off a pair of very thick
rimless glasses and wiping them over with a monogrammed handkerchief.
<quote>You have to be a student of human nature to be any good as an
Assessor &mdash; any good to the Company, that is,</quote> he added. <quote>Without
appearing to be unhelpful or hard-hearted, you've just got to cut the
claims as low as you can.</quote>
   <p>He replaced his glasses, turning them upside down and swivelling
the earpieces round.
   <p><quote>Of course I've been in this a long time now,</quote> he went on,
<quote>and although I know there's a lot of rot talked about a sixth sense
and all that, I think I have got something that helps me size a
thing up pretty well. Not every case who comes before you is trying
it on, you know, but most of them are out for what they can get. And
who wouldn't be?</quote> he asked, turning round and looking me full in the
face, through his upside down glasses. His eyes appeared enormous
when one looked back at him, like watery amoeba in a microscope. I
began to feel a bit amoebic myself, almost as if it were I who had
been found <quote>trying it on.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, of course,</quote> I agreed hurriedly. <quote>But many of your
cases must be really deserving ones, aren't they? I mean,
bread-winners disabled with mouths to feed, and all that sort of
thing?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ah, yes, there is a bit of that, of course,</quote> he said, <quote>But
we usually have some confidential reports beforehand which give a good
idea. I'm a medical man myself though: I used to be a G.P. in
the Midlands before I went over whole time as Claims Assessor. They
don't know I'm a medico when they come up before me. I get some yarns
spun me sometimes, I can tell you.</quote>
   <p>He chuckled moistly, clouding his reversible glasses which had to
be removed again for demisting.
   <p><quote>You take this case this afternoon, that I've come up about. If
this chap's shoulder &mdash; his right shoulder, too &mdash; if it's as bad as he
says, then of course he won't be able to work at all with his right
hand or arm &mdash; perhaps never again, which is a serious thing for a
family man with seven young children.
   <p><quote>I can't go making mistakes, can I? His employers have been
sued for &pound;10,000 &mdash; loss of potential earnings, inconvenience,
suffering &mdash; all the usual claims trotted out.
   <p><quote>It's a bit easier when you've got a chap with something you can
actually see that's wrong. It's these fellows with <squote>loss of
concentration</squote> or <squote>intermittent headaches</squote> or <squote>recurrent
depression</squote> that are the most difficult. How can you prove <squote>loss
of concentration</squote>? He doesn't have to prove he ever could
concentrate. That's one of the little problems I have to sort out.
Headaches are the same &mdash; nothing to go on or prove either way. A bad
headache's a rotten thing, of course, if you really have one.</quote>
   <p><quote>What about the <squote>recurrent depressions</squote>?</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>Well,</quote> he replied, <quote>That's difficult too. It's easy to go
about with a long face saying how terrible everything is, and who's to
say he doesn't really feel perfectly all right?</quote>
   <p>We pondered this situation for a moment or two in silence. As a
new member of this Department of Insurance, I was being sent round by
the Company to have a first-hand look at the way the Assessor worked.
Mr. Ridley was reckoned a wizard at the job. They said he saved
the firm tens of thousands of pounds a year, but nobody knew just how
he managed it.
   <p>I was looking forward to seeing him in action. I had heard a lot
about his <squote>Psychology</squote> angle, but could not see how this would help
in most of the cases.
   <p>The <squote>case</squote> up that afternoon had claimed that because the
management had not allowed a wide enough passageway between two
machines he had banged against one of them, seriously affecting his
whole nervous system down the right side of his body. He could, he
claimed, only raise his right arm to elbow level very slowly and with
great difficulty, and higher than his elbow, it would not go at all.
He had already been off work for a month, and the arm had not
<squote>responded to treatment,</squote> much to the surprise of the doctors.
   <p>It had in fact got gradually worse, according to the man himself.
He needed help to put on his clothes, and had been obliged to learn
to do all manner of things with his left hand when he was not the
least bit left-handed, naturally. His wife would have to give up her
evening work to look after him: that meant a regular allowance out of
the Insurance to compensate her. He would need some form of electric
tricycle to get him about, and a small garage built to house it. The
injury, he had been told by a friend, might easily spread to his legs,
and in view of the worry about this, the sum of &pound;10,000 would
probably be quite inadequate.
   <p>His <quote>statement of basis of claim</quote> ran to three sides of
foolscap <quote>dictated by me and written by my wife, owing to the injury
what prevents my writing.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Ridley was unperturbed by this voluminous evidence of the
state of the man's injuries.
   <p><quote>I'm afraid it doesn't seem quite right to me somehow,</quote> he
said, pulling off the glasses yet again. It was a very irritating
gesture: perhaps, I thought, he did it deliberately to put his cases
off their guard, to take their minds off themselves and to give
themselves away.
   <p><quote>You see, if he really is as bad as he says, the sensitivity of
some nerves would be bound to be affected at the finger extremities
even supposing there has been no bruising of tissue. The doctors
apparently can find nothing actually wrong. It's only that he
maintains he cannot raise his arm. When it was raised up quickly by a
doctor when he wasn't expecting it, he let out such a scream that the
wretched doctor thought he had torn the arm right off! After that,
they have been a bit chary about wrenching it up and down.
   <p><quote>However,</quote> he added after a minute or two, <quote>I think it's time
we went over and saw for ourselves. Come along with me.</quote>
   <p>We walked across to the Assessment Office and up into Mr.
Ridley's room. There was nothing particular about it. Just the usual
desk (back to the light of course), a couple of chairs, a reading
chart on the wall, and a bookcase about six feet tall with a few
papers and other oddments on it.
   <p>Mr. Ridley spoke to the attendant: <quote>Send Mr. Alton in now,
would you please?</quote>
   <p>A few moments passed. Then there was a shuffling outside on the
linoleum, and the door opened. Mr. Alton's left hand pushed at the
handle, for his right arm was hanging dejectedly at his side, patently
useless and perhaps even causing pain.
   <p><quote>Ah, Mr. Alton, come in, how do you do?</quote> smiled Mr. Ridley
holding out a hand. The limp right arm quivered, but quick as a flash
the sturdy remaining left hand took its place for a brave handshake.
   <p><quote>I've been thinking your case over,</quote> said Mr. Ridley,
sitting down at once at his desk, leaving Mr. Alton standing without
a chair. <quote>It is certainly one of the most unfortunate I have come
across and our hearts go out to you and your family in this serious
blow. I think &pound;15,000 is the least we can reasonably offer in
compensation, and if you are agreeable to this, I am authorized to
write you a cheque this very minute in full settlement, without
ado.</quote>
   <p>After rubbing his glasses as usual, Mr. Ridley pulled out a
fountain pen, took the cap off and briskly prepared to write.
   <p>Mr. Alton evidently could hardly believe his ears, mercifully
unaffected by his injury. He could only nod his agreement. <quote>Yes, I
think that would do very well,</quote> he managed after a moment when power
of speech returned.
   <p><quote>Right then,</quote> said Mr. Ridley, pen at the ready. <quote>Just
hand me down my cheque book from that bookcase, will you, and we'll
get it cleared up.</quote>
   <p>Alas for poor Mr. Alton. I did feel a little sorry for him.
   <p>The bookcase was on his right. From the top, the bright blue
cheque book was plainly visible. A step forward, and Mr. Alton's
arm &mdash; his right arm, that poor injured right arm upon whose failing
strength a wife and many small children had depended for their daily
bread &mdash; swung up as easily and quickly as that of a policeman on point
duty. Rapid fingers closed upon the beckoning cheque book with new
found health.
   <p>He was halfway to Mr. Ridley's desk before the awful
implication of his action dawned upon Mr. Alton.
   <p>His face went scarlet, then drained. Tiny beads of sweat
appeared. He turned and left the room without a word.
   <p><quote>You see what I mean,</quote> said Mr. Ridley, as he put the cap
back on his unused pen. <quote>The study of human nature is a great help
in this profession.</quote>
<head>Short story by NAT EASTON</head>
<head>The way of escape</head>
   <p>THE wind had slapped the notice so hard and often you had to
lean with it to read the faded letters, Unfit For Motorists. I
smiled, patting the weather-roughened wood. I slipped the car off the
track onto the moor, left it behind the V-shaped ruin of an old stone
barn &mdash; pointing back the way I'd come.
   <p>Light hearted, sure of myself somehow in my completely new
outfit, I walked to the edge of the great heather brow and looked down
its tumbling slopes to the sea below. For several minutes I stood
there, just wishing and willing, and taking in the spread of land and
ocean, then I slithered into the scoured out track and plunged
downwards eagerly.
   <p>The banks were high, the surface like a forgotten river bed &mdash;
dry, bread-coloured mud and stones the years had smoothed but not
budged. About halfway down, a path of bare, trodden soil led to a
gate in a high privet hedge. I stopped, looking over at it,
pep-talking myself, then braced up and went forward.
   <p>The bungalow was as neat a piece of transplanted suburbia as a
man could imagine. The path was concrete, straight as a railway line.
On each side there was a shaved square of lawn the size of a blanket
with a round bed of roses in the middle of it, slap in the middle.
Each lawn was overlooked by a bay window, one packed with red
geraniums. A wire basket of flowers hung over the front door. The
glass of the windows and the leaded door panel shone as though the
leather had just left it. The green and cream paintwork took a bath
regularly.
   <p>I poked a gloved finger into the copper letter box and raised the
flap. The corridor hall was laid with polished orange and brown
linoleum, covered down the middle with a runner of plain beige carpet,
like a continuation of the path. The hall-stand held one umbrella,
impeccably furled, one horn-handled walking-stick, a heavy raincoat on
a hanger, a series of crisp trilbies and a check cap. Beyond that the
shadows took over.
   <p>I lowered the flap gently and side-stepped to the bay window on
the left. Squinting through the geraniums I saw a green three-piece
suite, a bureau, dining table and chairs of dark oak, a red leather
tufty, and one of those modern cut-down pianos. The empty fireplace
was shielded by a blue hydrangea in a pot that had been painted green.
Above the tobacco jar on the chimney-piece six pipes hung from a
rack. The seventh slot was vacant.
   <p>There were two letters in the middle of the table, one under a
heavy glass paper-weight.

<text id=LOBL24>
   <p>The outline of the case which follows will, I hope, be
sufficient to secure a withdrawal of the questions. If this fails, I
shall of course be glad to offer the Members concerned a full and free
opportunity to question me, as well as the officers who have conducted
the investigation, in whatever fashion they think fit.
   <p>Their suspicions are the more ironical in that Gillian was
actually arrested yesterday morning, on my personal instructions.
Since the Department of Public Prosecutions regards the evidence
against him as insufficient, the arrest was made without a warrant;
and within a couple of hours Gillian was inevitably once again a free
man.
   <p>My action did, however, succeed in its intended purpose: Gillian
and Mrs Wynter had planned to be married yesterday afternoon; as a
result of the scene that occurred in my office the marriage will not
now take place.
   <p>You will say, and rightly, that it is no business of the police
to discourage people who wish to marry murderers. Nonetheless, when
one partner is completely unsuspicious, there is, I believe, a good
deal to be said on humane grounds for at least dropping a hint. In
fact, the simple ruse we employed succeeded handsomely, thereby
confirming the theory we had formed as to the only possible method by
which this perplexing murder can have been committed.
   <p>Gillian's arrest was so contrived that Mrs. Wynter would be
with him at the time; she was <quote>allowed</quote> to accompany him to
Scotland Yard, and on arrival both of them were brought to my office.
Also present were Superintendent Colleano (in charge of the case),
Detective-Inspector Pugh (who made the arrest), and a shorthand writer
(P. C. Clements). Despite Mrs. Wynter's urgings, Gillian
declined to send for a solicitor; his attitude was fatalistic
throughout and he looked ill.
   <p>I need hardly say that if Gillian's arrest had been anything
other than a trick there would have been no question of my confronting
him personally. As it was, I was able to use our previous
acquaintance as a pretext for the meeting. I told him, quite
untruthfully, that I had just returned from leave, and was anxious for
old times' sake to hear an account of the circumstances which had
resulted in the Deputy A.C.'s ordering his arrest, and to look
into the matter in person; and it is the measure of the queer,
apathetic state he was in that he apparently swallowed this
preposterous tale without turning a hair.
   <p>The proceedings opened with Colleano's giving me a summary of the
case. From our point of view this was mere camouflage; but it is
necessary to repeat it here for the purpose of clarifying what
happened subsequently.
   <p>Approximately two years ago, Dr. Harold Wynter, a general
practitioner working in the Somerset town of Midcastle, was tried for,
and convicted of, the manslaughter of a patient through gross
negligence. The evidence against him was by no means decisive, but
both judge and jury seem to have been influenced by the fact that the
doctor himself was a morphine addict. He was adjudged guilty and
sentenced to imprisonment for three years.
   <p>At Nottsville Prison &mdash; to which Gillian had a year previously
been appointed governor &mdash; Wynter's first few weeks were spent in the
infirmary, where he was weaned of his addiction before being
transferred to the cells. Very shortly afterwards, however, he began
to suffer from attacks of angina pectoris. Accordingly, he was
excused from all serious exertion; and in addition &mdash; since he proved a
model prisoner &mdash; was allowed a cell to himself, so that he mingled
with the other prisoners only on the occasions when he took light
exercise in the yard.
   <p>His wife, Ellen Wynter, wrote to him regularly and seems to have
visited him as often as she could; these visits were, however,
restricted in number owing to the fact that for financial reasons she
had been obliged to take a job some considerable distance away.
   <p>In the ordinary course of things &mdash; taking into account remissions
for good conduct &mdash; Wynter would have been released in October of this
year.
   <p>On April 23rd he died in his cell.
   <p>This was discovered when luncheon was brought to him at noon on
that day. In the absence of contra-indications, the death was
ascribed to the angina &mdash; for although a man suffering from this
complaint may, and often does, live on for a great many years, there
is no guarantee that any single attack may not finish him. As with
all prison deaths, however, an inquest was held. But there was no
post mortem, since none seemed to be called for, and on April 27th
Wynter was buried in the prison cemetery, his death being certified as
due to his heart disease.
   <p>There the matter might well have rested. Three days later,
however, we received here at Scotland Yard an anonymous letter which
accused Gillian of having poisoned Wynter with a plant spray
containing nicotine; Gillian's motive, the writer added, was
infatuation with Wynter's wife.
   <p>I myself ordered that this accusation be investigated, and there
proved to be sufficient plausibility in it to justify us in exhuming
Wynter's body. The stomach was shown to contain a small but
sufficiently lethal quantity of nicotine; in consequence of this, a
full-scale examination of the circumstances was at once put in hand.
   <p>The writer of the anonymous letter was traced easily enough. He
was a warder at Nottsville named Parker, who conceived himself to have
a grudge against the Governor, and who purely by chance had come to
hear of the irregular association which did in fact exist between
Gillian and Mrs. Wynter; the nicotine, he said, was only a guess,
based on the fact that he knew this type of plant spray was used
occasionally on the Governor's shrubbery.
   <p>It was a suspiciously good guess, and Superintendent Colleano
devoted plenty of time and energy to investigating whether Parker
himself had opportunity or motive for poisoning Wynter. In the end,
however, it was established that he had neither. A second possibility
was that Wynter's death had some connection with the death of the
patient he was alleged to have neglected; but this again proved
unlikely, if not impossible.
   <p>To cut a long story short, the closest checking and
counter-checking failed to establish a motive for Wynter's death in
any of the prison staff &mdash; except Gillian.
   <p>Gillian's motive, however, was undeniably a strong one: he was in
love with Mrs. Wynter. There is no doubt, by the way, that Wynter
was devoted to his wife, to the extent that &mdash; in her view &mdash; he would
never have agreed to divorce her; and in spite of his illness he might
well have lived for many years after his release from Nottsville.
   <p>As to the manner in which Gillian and Mrs. Wynter became
acquainted, that, I think, calls for no detailed description here. It
is worth noting, however, that Gillian's obsession with the woman was
by no means a happy one. The husband was a prisoner in his personal
charge, undergoing a relatively savage sentence for a crime of which
he may quite possibly have been innocent; moreover, Wynter loved his
wife; and finally, he was an incurable invalid.
   <p>To a man with Gillian's record for probity these considerations
may well have been horribly distressing; he himself has said that they
worried him deeply &mdash; and his anxiety was naturally compounded by the
fact that from the official point of view his surreptitious
relationship with Mrs. Wynter was an unforgivable offence for which
his resignation would certainly be demanded as soon as the truth
became known. As you are aware, that resignation was tendered, and
accepted, a fortnight ago.
   <p>Since Gillian is a wealthy man in his own right, his financial
position will not be affected; at the same time, for a man with his
long and devoted connection with the penal service, the wrench must
have been considerable.
   <p>Was Gillian's passion for Mrs. Wynter sufficiently strong to
override all these considerations? Unquestionably it was; and if so,
we may not unreasonably assume that it was strong enough to impel him
to the act of murder. He had motive, he had means.
   <p>Unfortunately, what he seems quite definitely not to have had was
opportunity.
   <p>The medical evidence as to the time of Wynter's death, and how
long he took to die, is regrettably uncertain; but there is a definite
consensus of opinion to the effect that Wynter could not have ingested
the poison earlier than breakfast time &mdash; that is to say, 7.30
a.m. on the day of his death. It seems equally certain, however,
that the nicotine was not in Wynter's breakfast; two warders
(perfectly reputable men) were concerned in the serving of this, and
moreover they were, as it happened, accompanied on this occasion by
one of H.M. Inspectors of Prisons, who had been staying in
Nottsville overnight; without going into the matter in detail, I can
assure you that short of a conspiracy among these three it is
absolutely impossible for the poison to have been administered in
Wynter's breakfast.
   <p>But if not at this time, when? On the morning of his death
Wynter did not, as it chanced, require fresh materials for the work he
performed in his cell; and the result of this was that the next visit
paid to him was at lunch-time &mdash; when his dead body was discovered. It
is certain that between 7.30 and noon Wynter was alone in his cell in
E block, and that during this period he came in contact with no one &mdash;
neither with Gillian nor with anyone else.
   <p>These circumstances would seem to point either to suicide or to
murder by trickery &mdash; for example, Wynter might previously have been
given a preparation of nicotine under the guise of medicine, and have
consumed it of his own volition some time on the morning of his death.
There exists, however, an insuperable objection to both assumptions:
before breakfast on that particular morning a snap search of the cells
in E block was carried out. These searches are routine, but they are
nevertheless thorough; and because of the recent suicide of Pickering
at Tawton Prison, special attention is currently being paid to the
possibility of concealed poison.
   <p>The upshot, as it applies to Wynter, you will guess: no pills or
powders or capsules or fluids were found in his cell other than the
small supply of trinitrini tablets which he was allowed to keep by him
in case of an angina attack. Of these, at the time of the search,
there were three, in a sealed container; and there is irrefutable
evidence to prove that this same container was still there, still
sealed and intact, when Wynter's body was discovered (it was, of
course, noticed particularly for the reason that at the time Wynter's
death was assumed to be the result of an angina attack sufficiently
disabling to have prevented him from getting at the tablets).
   <p>Now, Gillian's last direct encounter with Wynter had taken place
more than a week before the death; and on that occasion, as always,
another member of the prison staff was present &mdash; this precaution is so
invariable in dealing with convicts that if Gillian had at any time
departed from it in his dealings with Wynter, the fact must inevitably
have become known to us.
   <p>How, then, can Gillian possibly have committed this murder?
   <p>Or if it was suicide, how can Gillian or anyone else possibly
have supplied Wynter with the means?
   <p>The three warders who conducted the search on the morning of the
death might conceivably have conspired together to make Wynter a
present of poison; but in view of their excellent record this was not
a possibility which Colleano felt able to accept so long as another,
and likelier, explanation of the circumstances remained open to him.
   <p>And such an explanation did exist.
   <p>Despite the external appearances of what thriller-writers
describe as an <quote>impossible murder</quote> or a <quote>locked-room mystery,</quote>
the ingenious yet simple way in which Wynter had been murdered was
easily deduced from the facts I have given above.

<text id=LOBM01>
A shudder, more mental than physical, ran through him, and his mind
seemed to melt away into emptiness. His bulging eyes caught the
reclining form of Heather, who was still repeating in sing-song: <quote>.
&hellip; I will not give in&hellip;</quote> He stared at her blankly, mouthing an
incoherent gabble of half words. Then he broke into a crazy laugh
that made rolling echoes through the house, and trailed-off into a
long-drawn-out unearthly wail. The wail should have been despairing;
but its eerie note, even in its senseless gaggling babble, was
jubilant, triumphant.
<head>CHAPTER 7</head>
<head>HAPPY FACES AND AN EXIGENCY</head>
   <p>RETURNING to some degree of consciousness, Steve found
himself slumped in a chair trying to shake and blink away the
mind-deadening mists of hypnotic trance. To his still rather
stuporous perceptions, the world was an endless cloud in which he
floated, and in which various dark, shapeless objects went round and
round in concentric orbits. The rotations preceeded  by
rhythmic jerks, which were timed to a painful throb that bumped in his
head. He slapped himself in the face and cuffed the sides of his
head. Then by degrees the rotating objects slowed, and coming into
focus took the form of the furnishings in Dan Brown's living room.
   <p>He stood up unsteadily and looked about the room, trying to
gather his wits. Outside the dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and
the heights beyond were in silhouette, already a solid black. He
bumped into a floor lamp and switched it on. Heather McNabb still lay
on the couch, her body uncomfortably twisted and afflicted with
occasional spasmodic jerks. He went to the kitchen for water and
found Dan.
   <p>Dan was lying on a long bench in the breakfast nook, his head
bent upright against the wall. His usually animated face was
expressionless and looked flat, as though his nose had been pushed
back and his eyes and cheeks brought forward. He mouthed a low
mutter, punctuated at intervals with a few syllables of a crazy and
incoherent jargon. As Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped
shut, with jaws askew. There was utter imbecility in his blank face.
Presently the muttering started again, and went on and on. Stunned
and shaken, Steve drew a glass of water and went back to Heather.
   <p>Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still trying to
shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects. For several
minutes they had been facing each other across a low table, like two
old convalescents thoroughly bored with each other through forced
association. Then something like a zest for living began to come back
to Steve and he squeezed her hand. Her face took on enough animation
to produce a wan smile.
   <p>Dan's low muttering was just audible from the kitchen. And Steve
could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions she was
growing cold and numb with shock. She had seen Dan, or rather the
physical relic of him &mdash; the empty shell of flesh and bone, devoid of
intellect and personality. And these had been his great qualities, so
attractive to her.
   <p>
   <p>The Base Station had gone before, discharging its narrow plane of
ementalating energy along the length of the Earth's imaginary
longitudes, moving eastward like a knife-edged twilight in reversed
progression. It had brought the First Stage in the Thetan pattern of
conquest, the empty-minded receptiveness that prepared the way for the
Second Stage.
   <p>The Landingship followed with its longitudinal sweeps, an
invisible speck moving at incredible speed in the ionosphere. Up and
down, from pole to pole. Beaming down a moving cone of impulses, and
bringing the Second Stage. Bringing reverence and servility to
preconditioned humanity.
   <p>
   <p>Now the Thetan impulses of the Second Stage descended on Dan and
he received their inspiration. It was nine-thirty.
   <p>He rose from his breakfast-nook bench and came into the
livingroom, where Heather and Steve stood aghast at his entrance. He
came, almost falling forward in an ungainly shuffle, neck thrust out,
arms dangling loosely. Then, abruptly, he drew himself up and walked
on the very tips of his toes. He stretched his arms over his head and
yawned agape, drawing-in great breaths that became great sighs of
ecstacy.  His flat moonface shone with an undescribable
expression of utter happiness. Seeing Heather he came to her and
danced her gleefully around the room. He slapped Steve heartily on
the back, and then sat down.
   <p>He seemed preoccupied, as though groping for an elusive
understanding of some new and wonderful phenomenon. Then he beamed
upon his guests.
   <p><quote>They have come!</quote> he said reverently, gripping his hands
together between his knees and leaning forward. <quote>Isn't it a glorious
thing! Long awaited transcendent event, the exalted desire of all
mankind through all ages! The Kingdom of the Mind is at hand!</quote> He
turned beaming eyes upward and shook his head slowly from side to
side. <quote>Oh, Lord of Lords! I commend myself, through my mind which
is part of Thine, to Thy Command. For in doing Thy command my
services become a part of the ultimate fulfilment. Fulfilment of the
Kingdom of the Mind on Earth!</quote>
   <p>He had intoned this awful devotion in rapt attention, as though
repeating the faint phrasing of a distant voice. And his fervour grew
in stringendo until his last words were uttered in a frenzy of zeal
and adoration. Then, very calmly, and with a light of inner peace and
sure purpose shining in his eyes, he said: <quote>I go to bed now. Good
night.</quote>
   <p>Steve drove Heather to her nearby apartment and then continued
through the sleeping city to his place in Rockliffe. He drove down
the lighted streets, his passage controlled by traffic lights that
blinked green and red in their proper intervals. A superfluous
precaution for there was no other car abroad; and no pedestrian to
cross his path nor to wait at an intersection for the light to change.
At his apartment he garaged his car and then stood listening in the
night. Listening in vain. For the earth had lost its life-tempo, as
the heart loses its beat in death. Deadly stillness, deadly portent!
   <p>
   <p>Steve awakened early and switched on the radio, which he kept
tuned to CBO. The set lighted-up but gave only a low buzzing
sound. He had just finished shaving when it came on, with a flat
voice repeating: <quote>This is BBC calling &hellip; this is BBC
calling&hellip;</quote> After what seemed an undue period of repetition,
the voice went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony in
Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio went dead again,
and Steve had no stomach for breakfast.
   <p>It was a beautiful day, as firsts-of-June should be. Steve got
out the car and traversed the same empty streets as he had the night
before, to keep an appointment with Heather. Coming around the great
mass of the Chateau Laurier, he braked to a screeching stop. A flying
saucer was tilting and dipping over the War Memorial. There was a
deep whirring sound, and a high-pitched hissing overtone that sang in
his ears with an almost painful sharpness. He reversed and turned
back on McKenzie Avenue. The Thetans must not see him! He took
another route to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on the way.
   <p>Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at once; but Steve insisted
that they should first discuss their situation, as far as it could be
assessed, and to decide on what seemed to be the best way of meeting
it.
   <p><quote>The Thetans,</quote> he said, <quote>are presumably here to take charge,
as it were, of the minds of the people &mdash; who are probably falling all
over themselves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry them
out. Just what these orders will be, we don't know. Now, because of
prior hypnosis we have escaped Thetan subjugation. This time. But we
no longer have any immunity. There can be little doubt that if the
Thetans discover our mental independence they will promptly give us
their hypnotic treatment. If we can avoid undue prominence, it
may be that we can move about pretty freely without detection. If we
can &mdash; well, then we may be able to promote our own interests. What
those interests are, beyond personal security, I haven't a clue; but,
who knows, we may form the nucleus around which some sort of
resistance movement may be built.
   <p><quote>Now, to summarize what I think our course of action should be.
First, to avoid the Thetans like the plague, for they must not find
us out! Second, to tread pretty warily among our own people,
finding out just how much freedom we can take with safety. And third,
to study these damned Thetans. We must learn all we can about them.
There is just a hope that we may uncover some weakness, and find a
way of fighting back at them.</quote>
   <p>Heather agreed, and suggested that they use Dan as a specimen
demonstrating how the Thetan machinations had been working out. It
occurred to Steve that this may not have been entirely an objective
suggestion on her part; but he thought it a good idea nevertheless.
So they proceeded to see if the coast was clear. The street was
quiet and deserted, and there were neither sight nor sound of flying
saucers. So they ventured forth and made their way on foot to Dan's
house.
   <p>Dan came to the door at their ring but neglected to offer any
greeting. He was deeply preoccupied, and it seemed that the ringing
of a doorbell was to him a new and strange phenomenon. When he
finally beckoned to them to enter, the action gave the impression of
having been thought out and decided upon.
   <p>Inside they sat down unbidden, while Dan paced the floor. He
seemed completely unaware of their presence. They just stared at him,
turning their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and down,
up and down. His whole attitude was a mixture of impatience pending
an awaited communication and of a vague perplexity respecting his
surroundings and the purpose he was to serve.
   <p>Finally, being so obviously on their own, Heather and Steve tried
to make themselves at home. Steve switched on Dan's powerful,
world-wide radio and systematically turned the tuning knob through all
the tuning points of the world's great radio stations. The dials
lighted up but he got only a variety of squeaks and whistles. The
ether waves were without human voice or sound; they were dead to the
world.
   <p>Overhead a flying saucer whirred and, pitched high above the
whir, whined its pungent song. Dan stopped his pacing and became
profoundly attentive. It seemed that he was listening to unspoken
orders and they could almost hear him say, <quote>Yes, yes!</quote>, in his
eager acceptance of them.
   <p>Then he beamed on Steve and Heather in turn with an expression of
ineffable happiness on his flat face. Quickly taking his coat and hat
from the vestibule closet, he rushed from the house without a word.
   <p>They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue, where he
waited. The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street. But
not for long, for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon the Avenue
from its many tributary streets. It might have been a normal
business-day bustle, except for two anomalies. First, it was Sunday
morning; and, second, everyone walked, or drove, or waited as a person
possessed of a single all-exclusive purpose. There were no
pleasantries, no shouted greetings, no friendly waves of recognition.
Everyone minded his own business with a vengeance. Yet there was not
a grim or surly face in all the crowd. Anywhere that Heather and
Steve might look they found reflections of Dan Brown's indescribably
happy face.
   <p>After a long wait a bus appeared and they followed the beaming
Dan aboard, taking seats some rows behind him. Steve was beginning to
find the stereotyped, flattish, happy faces very disconcerting; and
looking at Heather he found a welcome relief in her relatively long
doleful one.

<text id=LOBM02>
In W.C.U., too, reference to the evil in that system would
be avoided like the plague in public debate. Mutually-sustaining
opposites...
   <p>Realtor's measure, being lost anyway, since the Mocrats were in a
minority, was not pressed to a vote; and it was a relief for the
Senate to turn from these remote and academic matters to the next item
on the agenda, a practical fug measure to <quote>Spyproof the Membrane
and Expand.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>Harry did not know what this meant and, as in Casino Ronde, had
the Cherokee Indian feeling. He decided to slip down to the canteen
for a cup of coffee.
   <p><quote>What's happening aloft?</quote> drawled a journalist, his elbows
sprawling over the canteen table, his pencil doodling among his
shorthand notes. <quote>This motion to spy-proof the membrane, what does
it mean?</quote>
   <p><quote>Haven't you heard? The fugs, especially, are scared by
reports that W.C.U. spies are being shot through the membrane in
capsules. They could guide missiles onto Back-Face targets which are
now safe.</quote> He picked his teeth. <quote>In the mountains they've found
little capsules, this big</quote> &mdash; he brandished a teaspoon &mdash; <quote>with
hundreds of tiny little red men inside them.</quote>
   <p><quote>Isn't it a bit far-fetched?</quote> said Harry, recalling what
Lilipendi had said, about the Mos being as credulous as Africans.
   <p><quote>If you ask me, the capsules and the red midgets inside them
come out of one of Moke's toy factories.</quote>
   <p><quote>Moke &mdash; Moke Blenkinsop you mean?</quote>
   <p><quote>Wouldn't it make sense? Traditionally Second Coming is
associated with Daggitt's, the membrane people, and has put more money
into it lately. Coincidence? If spy-proofing becomes statutory,
it'll mean a complete 360 degree new trap in the membrane.
   <p><quote>Will it become statutory?</quote>
   <p><quote>Realtor and his Mocrats will be against it, but Moke licked
them even when they were in power, though only just.
   <p><quote>Isn't Mike Renshaw a match for Moke?</quote>
   <p>Though leader of the Anti-Presidentials, Renshaw was known to be
left of centre, so by no means uncritical of big business.
   <p><quote>Renshaw's ulcers are bad this month. He's away resting and
playing clock-golf; and the end of next week, you know, the Bowery
President is coming over and they'll have a lot to talk about</quote> &mdash; a
sly reference to the long break in Mo-American affairs occasioned by
the Panama Affair. The Mos had refused to deal with Marjoribanks, but
had just agreed to receive his successor, President Scribner.
   <p><quote>So that's why Moke gets the right-wing A.P.'s to bring in
the spy-proofing now?</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm not saying so,</quote> but the journalist winked knowingly,
though probably he didn't know any more than Harry whether real
knowledge, rather than prejudice, or possibly just the policy of his
paper, lay behind that wink. And not for the first or last time the
American felt the Moon as an outsize social organism which is still
primitive in that it has not yet grown sufficient nervous system to be
aware of its own internal motions, far less of their outward
repercussions.
   <p><quote>But this place isn't really a Political Centre if Financier
Moke secretly inspires it,</quote> he said, thinking of those stories he
had read as a boy.
   <p><quote>I'm not saying so.</quote>
   <p><quote>But why shouldn't you if it's true? Haven't you free speech on
Moon?</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course we've got free speech; and we'll smash in the face of
anyone who says that we haven't!</quote>.
<head>20</head>
   <p>BUT during these real days in Aristotle Harry was not merely
dabbling in mighty Mo matters perhaps beyond the understanding of a
sub outsider: he was also carrying out his commitments to Mr.
Halliday, and Uncle Sam, by revising his stories. Energy had returned
with the Sun. Also the economic equilibrium which he had had in
Plato, before the interruption of the real nights. He determined to
spend the next series of them here in Aristotle, where the pace was
less than in Plato, almost reminding him of sleepy sub towns like
Philadelphia and Chicago. Then he would go back to Plato for a final
spell of real days and would return to New York in late January or
early February. Angelina might be a little sorry if we were not back
for Christmas as arranged, but he consoled himself by thinking that he
and Angelina would have plenty of time together in the future. And
Heaven alone knew when, if ever, he would be back on Moon again, and
able to do research at first hand into matters on which the future of
everyone, including Angelina, depended...
   <p>The recovery of his balance was due to the fact that he was
living, virtually without expenses, with the people to whom Moke had
sent him: little people who regarded him as lucky to have descended
from such economic altitudes. Tom Dreyfus had a job on the machines
in the Secretariat (Stamp Department) while Sally sulked at home.
They had been married for six years, but the salary raise, on the
expectation of which they had done so, had not materialised. <quote>Do you
know, I had to send back our bedroom furniture in the second year,</quote>
she moaned. She had contacts in political circles, a schoolfriend of
hers having married Lester Peron, a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the
(literally) all-powerful Rocket Release Board. Sometimes she took
Harry around with her, but never her husband, a fact he accepted as
inevitable. <quote>I guess Sally made a mistake about me,</quote> he said one
evening, when he had been left to cook his own meal. All Sally's
relations were makrodeb now, but Tom was a Static Mib, the
middle-income-bracket equivalent to sub-lil on the lower. The
economic shock had unmanned him and Harry, seeing his host busy among
soft foods in the kitchen, felt that the poor fellow was,
understandably, changing sex.
   <p>
   <p>So a happy week passed, and it was a lunar noon, and the dark
Earth was fringed with the <quote>Wedding ring effect</quote>, when eventually
Sally Dreyfus took Harry to see the Lester Perons. All Aristotle was
excited at the time, not by the prospect of the U.S. President's
visit, but by a great storm in the photosphere of the sun. A matter
which on Earth would hardly penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers
was of general interest to the Mos, doubtless because their habitat is
not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere. One wondered if this
greater awareness of the physical cosmos might with time instil the
reverence which, on Earth, nature inspires, especially when one
reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's Board presided had
it in their power permanently to warp the solar system. True enough,
such ultimate weapons had not been used in the last few wars, but it
seemed very probable that they would be in the next one, Moon and her
allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the weapons
pronounced conventional.
   <p>Lester was not home yet from his formidable duties and his wife,
in the manner of middle-brow wives, romanced about him in his absence.
   <p><quote>Lester was a country lawyer, and we were very small
microdebs, weren't we, Sally</quote> &mdash; here she had dropped her voice in
homage to the economic system: that was reverenced &mdash; <quote>when he
thought we might get GO a bit better if he entered politics. Know how
he did it? He's clever on the mouth-organ. So when he visited some
craterlet on Face (ours is an agricultural Back-Face area) the cry
would go up, as soon as he had spoken a few sentences of his speech:
<squote>Cut the politics, Lester, give us something on your mouth-organ.</squote>
That's how he got the votes, that's how we came through to makrodeb
status and got all these lovely things</quote> &mdash; she waved a plump hand
towards her grand pianos, etc: at the same time a door banged &mdash;
<quote>but don't say a word about it, Lester wants his mouth-organ to be
forgotten now. The time has come for him to be taken seriously as a
statesman.</quote>
   <p>Peron entered, a large man, who had once been handsome but was
now seedy-looking, a sufferer from stomach-ulcers. In the Back-Face
tradition he wore, and kept on indoors, a fifty gallon hat. Harry was
prepared for something unpleasant, for this was the Senator who had
annoyed the United States by bragging how he had once won a trick from
W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his rockets (an
admission which would scarcely help bluff to succeed the next time)
and, lately, by saying that if Mo land-troops had to come to the aid
of the O.G.O. contingent in the Panama region, <quote>no Mo dough-boy
will want to have an American G.I. fighting alongside him.</quote>
   <p>But privately he turned out to be as friendly as Mr. Wise the
tube manufacturer, to have the same adolescent openness and freshness,
though perhaps not the same maturity. One remembered that he was a
lawyer by training, and suspected that the points he made so sharply
in international politics were as abstract to him as those a lawyer
makes in a court of law. The motive would be the same in both cases,
to serve this home of his, in which his heart lay. Here the rocket
man's charm was disarming.
   <p>Yet when the time came to leave, Harry felt as depressed as when
he left Mrs. Halliday's office, exactly a month ago. If even Mo
statesmen only did what they had to do to get GO on an expanding
scale, and left the sum-total of their actions, and their lunar and
earthly repercussions, to luck (or to Moke), there was a vacuum where
there should be a centre of trust, responsible for the maintenance and
expansion of free society. The political life of Aristotle looked
more and more like a masquerade of business interests in disguise
which, far from attracting the allegiance of free men everywhere,
could only repel them.
   <p>
   <p>Then what of the cultural life? Did this perhaps nurture a
genuinely civilizing impulse which might in time become social fact
and counteract the obsession with economics which had grown up during
the Moon's first two centuries?
   <p>Harry borrowed Sally Dreyfus' car and drove out to Eudoxus
University to see the famous Rodeos which take place at the end of the
Advent term, one more of those Mo <quote>traditions</quote> which look so
suspect to the American visitor.
   <p>In the cold gas and harsh sunshine of the December afternoon,
last year students revolved in interlocking circles on the vast, round
campus. At the centre of each circle stood personnel managers of
corporations, together with professors and their filing clerks. The
students had bought their college education forward and were now being
bought forward in their turn. By comparing personal appearances with
university records, the agents of the businesses would pick on young
men and women who interested them, and contracts would be initialled
at the end of the parade. But since starting salaries would depend on
grade A or B in the finals next May, and since mating prospects would
depend upon salaries, scholarship for these fine young people was
closely geared to economic and biological ends which, essentially,
were really means. So, seeing them revolve in circles, Harry had the
feeling that Moke (or what Moke consciously or unconsciously
symbolised, anyway in Harry's mind) had these splendid young people by
the short hairs, and was diverting them from true life. Stepping out
in their white shorts, they looked glad enough to be diverted,
however, with the single exception of one worried little man-student
who kept getting out of step. He looked as if nothing Moke and his
minions could do to him would ever make him GO; but the reason
probably lay in elementary neurosis and not in some eruption from
those deeper layers in the human psyche which are trans-economic.
   <p>So once again the metaphysics were depressing, and in absolute
contrast to the physical display. Mos have an un-American love of
parades, and these young ones, on parade for jobs which they had to
get to pay off their college bills, were naturally putting their best
foot forward.

<head>6</head>
   <p>A night or two later we were strolling, Lord Undertone and I,
on sentry-go, round the tents and we caught sight of Mr Septimus
looking out through the flap of the one he occupied with his
lordship's own self. <squote>Bit moody,</squote> remarked my companion. <squote>Like
he used to be years ago ... remember?</squote>
   <p>Well did I remember the crisis of emotion into which he was
plunged one night at Abbotsfield... a dinner-party it was... when he
first set eyes on Miss Ariadne; but I did not wish to impart my
thoughts or any misgivings I might have on this subject and in any
case my recollections of the Manor, of my parlour and Sally sitting
there, and of all the amenities were at that moment so strong that I
dared not speak.
   <p><squote>Something's up,</squote> said Lord Undertone, carefully casual.
<squote>The servants are all on edge... did you notice? And the mules
didn't seem to want to get off the raft.</squote> He peered as it were into
the dark secrets of the jungle. <squote>Think there's Indians about?</squote>
   <p>It was most certainly an eerie night, exceptionally brilliant and
strange, for in the proximity of the mountains, whose presence I could
almost smell, the air grew less humid and as there was no moon the
galaxies had it their own way so that the forest looked ever more
mysterious in their faint, silver light. <squote>Impressive,</squote> Lord
Undertone said, gazing reverently on the cosmic handiwork. <squote>All
those stars. But I'm a bit earthbound tonight, Trout. I've got a
queer feeling, like I always get when something sensational's going to
happen. There's things lurking if you ask me. Might be jaguar, might
be... head-shrinkers. Hope I die kind of composed, Trout. I mean you
can't imagine the Christian martyrs twisting and shrieking, no matter
how bad it felt, the fire you know, or a lion munching, or arrows
where it hurts most. Or can you. Look over there.</squote> He pointed to
the shadows beyond the river. <squote>Something moved.</squote>
   <p><squote>It may well be the case, my lord, that the darkness conceals
some threat.</squote> I did what I could to dissemble my dislike of the
situation.
   <p><squote>Well, what are you going to do about it?</squote>
   <p><squote>I, my lord?</squote> Somewhat resentful of a responsibility that did
not fall within the strict terms of a butler's engagement, yet at the
same time flattered, I felt bound to advance one or two suggestions
that occurred to me. <squote>Bottle-Foot, my lord.</squote>
   <p><squote>Bottle-Foot?</squote> His lordship may have thought I had become
unbalanced through fear.
   <p><squote>A character Mr Gilberto mentioned the other day, my lord. A
being of whom the forest Indians are said to be mortally afraid, with
a hoof shaped like the heel of a bottle. If your lordship will excuse
me a moment...</squote>
   <p><squote>All right, but don't be long.</squote>
   <p>Rummaging among the remains of our provisions I found a bottle
with which I made numerous marks on the ground surrounding our tents
and a few yards into the jungle, as far as I dared venture. <squote>If they
should observe these footprints, my lord,</squote> I said, rather proud of
the device, <squote>they may be deterred from attacking us.</squote>
   <p><squote>Ummm. Any other ideas?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes, my lord. There is also a creature known as the
water-mother who sits on a lily-leaf singing and entices men into the
stream, where they drown. She has long green hair and...</squote>
   <p><squote>Kind of Lorelei, you mean?</squote>
   <p><squote>Precisely, my lord. A highly poetical conception. If we could
impersonate such a being...</squote>
   <p><squote>What, me? Sit on a lily-leaf and sing? Not likely, Trout.
Better get hold of Mrs Caine... she's a witch if you like... draw
anyone into the water.</squote> His lordship sighed as one who wouldn't
mind dying in certain unlikely circumstances. <squote>D'you think Septimus
has gone nuts over her?</squote>
   <p>The question startled my secret thoughts; but before I had time
to formulate a discreet answer the Indians were all over us and though
I was able by means of a trick practised in equally repugnant
circumstances to floor the first three who attacked the situation got
out of hand. Small, repulsive creatures they were, with black, matted
hair and a striking resemblance to the shrunk heads we had gazed at
recently; and I have no hesitation in saying that they would have made
an end of us but for an intervention so unexpected, so unusual, that
only the necessity of rounding my narrative compels me to mention it.
   <p>It will be appreciated that whereas what I am about to relate
passed in a series of flashes it seemed very long during the action.
Standing with the blade of a rough kind of spear at my back (and I
was aware of cuts and scratches that might or might not prove
poisonous), I did my somewhat futile best by necessarily restricted
gestures to draw attention to the ground; but whether these savages
saw Bottle-Foot's print or not they seemed to have no fear of him,
neither did they take the least notice of the alarming countenance
Lord Undertone had assumed. At first glimpse of our assailants I had
of course smitten the empty tin of fruit-salad that constituted our
warning note, hoping that its flat tinkle would serve to rouse our
companions; trusting also that it might evoke some magical
demonstration on the part of Mrs Caine.
   <p>In what was I suppose little more than a few seconds Canon
Pluckley emerged from his tent with the air of one who desires to
investigate a situation in the interests of scholarship, but the
Indians seized and threw the poor gentleman to the ground and when
Mr Septimus followed, armed with a boathook and fiery with
indignation, as having a measure of savage clearsightedness they could
undoubtedly see, they prepared for the kill. Certainly there would
have been a painful resolution of our existence but for the mysterious
intervention to which I have alluded.
   <p>I had more than half expected that Mrs Caine, if and when she
appeared in our midst, would make with her raised hand a sign of
power; she did nothing of the kind. She came from her tent indeed,
with Mr Gilberto, both of them cool as you wish; but though at sight
of them the Indians made a curious hissing noise like the noise of
snakes and poised their spears with a view to hurling or stabbing,
having first no doubt dispatched those of us they already held, our
host and his lady seemed to have no resource but a kind of personal
immunity. It was scarcely a moment in which I expected to be reminded
of another book that is frequently in my mind, Through the
Looking-glass, in which, it will be remembered, as two characters
are about to engage in battle a fierce, black bird, a crow of unusual
size, appears over the wood, putting an end to the quarrel by its
formidable aspect. In just such a manner there now showed itself over
our heads, not with noise and menace but in silence more frightening
than thunder, a great bird not black but white, as it were an eagle;
and when, having circled, it rose and returned into the starry sky the
Indians, if Indians they were, had vanished. Believe it or not. I
have only to add that Mrs Caine dressed our cuts and scratches with
medicaments from her little box while Mr Gilberto held his hand over
them with effect that I myself felt a kind of radiant heat.
<head>3</head>
   <p><squote>IS this the place?</squote> asked Lord Undertone, peering about
for vestiges of a golden temple or like portent. <squote>Is this where the
feller jumped in, Gilberto?</squote> We were gathered at the edge of a
cliff perhaps three hundred feet over a lake, deep in the Cordillera.
   <p><squote>Es posible que... I mean...</squote> But Mr Gilberto broke
off. <squote>What do you say, Feather?</squote>
   <p><squote>It is always told that where the man of gold plunged in his
image is to be seen under the surface,</squote> she said.
   <p><squote>Nothing there,</squote> said his lordship, gazing down the wall of
clean rock that reflected mountain and forest, the cliff and our own
peeping faces.
   <p>It was such a lake, remote and magical, as well might have been
the scene of some legendary event, though I imagine that the landscape
must have looked very different in those far-off days. We came to it
riding muleback along wooded slopes; and agreeable it was after that
humid, malodorous journey by river and swamp, for as the path ascended
the climate grew temperate and the vegetation, so Canon Pluckley said,
subtropical, characteristically so, although I myself should have
described it as fairylike. Here then we were, disposed in a
commodious hut built of pine-logs or some such timber, on the shore of
the lake at a point where it debouched in a stream that must find its
way, I supposed to the distant Atlantic; around us abundant provision
of fruit, fish and if we desired it duck. I had a distinct impression
that the hut had recently been cleaned and prepared for visitors.
   <p>Mrs Caine said we were to go no further unless and until we
were sent for, confirming another impression that became more and more
definite, namely, that she was in touch with an invisible source of
authority. Naturally her words stimulated an already lively interest
in the near future and as usual Lord Undertone could not refrain from
questions. <squote>Sent for?</squote> His gaze examined the hut. <squote>No
telephone. No wireless. No...</squote> It dawned on him. <squote>Stupid of me!
Tele-what-d'you-call-it of course!</squote>
   <p>Mrs Caine smiled and with this all of us must be content. For
my own part I should have been ready to remain here several days,
collecting my wits so to speak, arranging my expectations, though
wondering if Sally could be brought here by aeroplane, as I am
unwilling to undertake any adventure without her; not that there was
any place where even a vertical landing could be effected. Sally and
of course Mrs Septimus, for surely Mr Septimus stood in the same
case as myself? But was it so? I allowed myself to entertain for an
instant the idea, the strange, the unwelcome, the almost inconceivable
idea, that Ariadne's arrival would be inopportune; and with the idea
came a somewhat vulgar impulse, which I refused, to watch Mr
Septimus more closely, Mrs Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would
surely show some anxiety by now if he noticed anything untoward. But
all three were to the casual observation I permitted myself unruffled;
Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very thoughtful, but that was his
habit.
   <p>Indeed we were all invaded by a most tranquil mood. Even the
Indian servants relaxed, knowing, so Mr Gilberto told us, that the
wild and savage tribes never approached this region: at any rate they
remained with us, perhaps for such protection as our presence, or
Mrs Caine's, afforded, sticking rather to their quarters, going no
further than the beach to fish, whereas we ourselves explored the
whole neighbourhood, half, I think with an eye to fabulous remains.
But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never far from our minds
that at any moment we were to receive a summons. I could see that
Mr Septimus was impatient for it.
   <p>This afternoon, then, we climbed a promontory, a mass of clean
rock crowned with trees and bushes, that stood well out over the lake.
The thing about this great sheet of water on which we looked down was
its astonishing stillness: it seemed to reflect not only its own
dreamy shores, not only the forests of red-leaved trees on the
mountainsides and the snowfields above, not only the sky but the
invisible ground of being itself, as if a man should gather himself
into himself and in meditation perceive what is otherwise
imperceptible. Away to the right, far below, I could see one of our
Indians fishing and I declare that the ripple his cast made was the
only change in all that expanse.

<head>THE 2.20 FROM DINAS</head>
<head>Start running punctual and &mdash; where are you?</head>
<head>BY E. L. MALPASS</head>
   <p>NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a single-decker
Welsh bus could have got itself into orbit. Shooting up over the pass
a bit too carefree, and becoming airborne? Caught by a sudden gust of
wind? A combination of the two? No one seems to know. But the fact
remains that get itself into orbit it did. And a fine old fuss there
was about it, too.
   <p>Here are the known facts. On 10th July, the bus, the 2.20 from
Dinas to Llangrwl, left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual. Aboard,
apart from the crew, were Mrs. Megan Thomas and her five-year-old
son Cadwallader; pretty little Morfydd Owen; Mr. Stanley Hayball and
Miss Ethel Yates, hikers from Birmingham; Price the Provisions; and
the Rev. Edwards.
   <p>Yes, the bus set out from Dinas. So much is established. Ifor
Huw Evans, Propr., watched it go from the windows of the Dinas Motor
Omnibus Co.
   <p>Very interested, Ifor was. For there was his garage hand, Dai
Pugh, taking a tearful farewell of Morfydd Owen. Morfydd, who had
until recently been Ifor's typist, but was now returning to her home
town as a fully-fledged schoolteacher.
   <p><quote>But I'm only going fifteen miles away,</quote> Morfydd was saying.
<quote>Not the end of the world, is it?</quote>
   <p><quote>For me it is,</quote> Dai said wretchedly, wiping his hands on his
overalls preparatory to a last embrace. <quote>You will not be remembering
a mere garage hand when you are lording it over the Mixed Infants of
Llangrwl.</quote>
   <p><quote>Silly boy,</quote> said Morfydd. Though she could not help
wondering whether, now she had qualified as a schoolteacher, poor
little Dai was quite the man for her.
   <p>A nice boy of course. But perhaps in the new world she was
entering there might be boys equally nice, and with far more to offer.
   <p>The conductor rang his bell.
   <p><quote>Good-bye, Dai,</quote> said Morfydd, smiling from the bottom step.
   <p><quote>Good-bye, Morfydd.</quote> He sought to enfold her in his arms.
But he was too late. She was already up the bus steps, and the bus
was away. And Morfydd Owen waving, unkissed, from the window. And
Dai, on the pavement, knowing in his heart that Morfydd was leaving
him as surely as she was leaving Dinas.
   <p>So the bus set out for Llangrwl.
   <p>But it never reached there! Somewhere, on those fifteen miles of
mountain roads, it disappeared from the earthly scene.
   <p>The first intimation that all was not well came when a Mr.
Isaiah Roberts, landlord of The Traveller's Joy, rang up the Dinas
Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their damn bus.
   <p><quote>Left here all right,</quote> said Ifor. <quote>Two-thirty-five, on the
dot.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's supposed to leave at two-twenty.</quote>
   <p><quote>Who says so?</quote>
   <p><quote>Your timetable.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables,</quote>
Ifor said, reasonably. <quote>Start running punctual and where are you?
People get left behind, isn't it? Very exasperating for one and
all.</quote>
   <p>Exasperated is what Mr. Roberts sounded. <quote>But it's over an
hour late, now. And me due in Llangrwl ten minutes ago for a meeting
of the Licensed Victualler's Association.</quote>
   <p>Shaken, Ifor Evans was. But not showing it, mind. <quote>Mustn't
expect too much on these Welsh roads, must we now?</quote> he said, very
conciliatory. <quote>Not on the M1, are we?</quote>
   <p><quote>And what are you going to do about it?</quote> Tendentious, Mr.
Roberts sounded.
   <p><quote>What do you want me to do? Send out a sheriff's posse, is
it?</quote>
   <p>No sense of humour, that Isaiah. He banged down the receiver.
Very uncivil.
   <p>Dropped the mask, now, Ifor did. <quote>Dai Pugh,</quote> he bellowed.
   <p><quote>Leap on your bicycle and scour the countryside between here and
The Traveller's Joy. The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
complete her mission.</quote>
   <p>Paled, did Dai. For the two-twenty carried, for him, a cargo
more precious than jewels. Though Mofydd Owen was, as he feared,
departed out of his life, he still loved her dearly.
   <p>Already, even as with trembling fingers he fastened his trouser
clips, he was seeing her lying in some dreadful ravine, or beset by
robbers, or being whisked off to Emergency Ward 10. But even his
imagination, luckily for him, did not visualise the awful truth &mdash; that
Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for the title of <quote>First Woman to
Enter Space.</quote>
   <p><quote>Where are we going, Mam?</quote> inquired little Cadwallader when
his child mind grasped the fact that the green earth was falling away
at a rate of knots.
   <p>Where indeed? Megan Thomas spoke sharply to the conductor,
demanding an explanation. But nonplussed, the conductor was. A good
man, mind; knew his job. But out of depth in this particular
instance. Fingered his ticket-punch nervously. Peered out of the
window. Went and consulted the driver.
   <p><quote>Where are we going?</quote> he echoed Cadwallader.
   <p><quote>Damned if I know, boy,</quote> said the driver. <quote>But something
very untoward has happened, if you ask me.</quote>
   <p>Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser, was the Rev. Edwards.
Now he put down his paper, folded it, and glanced idly out of the
window.
   <p>Looked again, eyes starting from his head. <quote>God bless my
immortal soul,</quote> he cried.
   <p><quote>Never mind your immortal soul,</quote> said Megan Thomas tartly.
<quote>Here we are traversing the heavens at the very moment when we
should be running into Llangrwl bus station. And no one doing the
first thing about it.</quote>
   <p>Stung, the conductor was. <quote>What you expect me to do?</quote> he
inquired, bitter. <quote>Radio Flying Control at London Airport, is it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Mutual recriminations will get us nowhere,</quote> boomed the Rev.
Edwards.
   <p><quote>It's all very well,</quote> commented Mr. Hayball from the back
seat. <quote>But Eth and me wanted to be at the Youth Hostel before
dark.</quote>
   <p>Morfydd Owen was silent. But she looked down at the
fast-disappearing earth, and it seemed to her that she would never see
her Dai again. And though half an hour ago she had regarded this
possibility with fortitude, it now filled her with dismay. Quietly
she began to weep...
   <p>Dai, meanwhile, was pedalling furiously on the road. Not a sign
of the bus. He passed The Traveller's Joy. At last he caught up
Mr. Roberts, walking very dogged towards Llangrwl.
   <p><quote>Afternoon, Mr. Roberts,</quote> he called, polite, as he shot
past. His spirits were rising. He had seen no sign of an accident.
Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken. He would find the
bus safe and sound in Llangrwl, and his dear Morfydd quietly having
tea in her own home.
   <p>But disappointment awaited him. A restive queue of people in the
bus station, waiting to be transported to Dinas. And when he went to
Morfydd's house, all he found was Morfydd's mam, working herself up
proper...
   <p>Getting dark, now. The conductor switched on the lights. The
beleaguered passengers peered out of the windows. Little to be seen,
only a few lone stars, and the distant earth brooding in her shroud of
mist. Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped, nursing the sleeping
Cadwallader. Driver and conductor peered ahead into nothingness. On
the back seat Stan Hayball embraced his Eth. Morfydd thought of Dai.
The Rev. Edwards, standing at the front, looked at his forlorn
flock.
   <p><quote>What about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda?</quote> he
suggested hopefully.
   <p>They looked at him, sullen. His heart sank. If the Welsh found
the situation too desperate for singing, then the situation, he
realised, must be desperate indeed.
   <p>But suddenly they were roused from their lethargy. Something was
approaching, faster, faster, a tearing hurrying blur that was past and
gone in a moment, followed by a great rush of sound. They waved
frantically. But the jet aircraft was already miles away, swinging
down to the darkening earth.
   <p>
   <p><quote>It passed me at fifty thousand feet, sir. It was climbing
steadily.</quote>
   <p>Group Captain Llewelyn Jones, Officer Commanding R.A.F.
Station, Dinas, looked keenly at the Flying Officer who had burst so
unceremoniously into his office. <quote>And what did it look like,
Broughtons? Some sort of rocket?</quote>
   <p>Flying Officer Broughtons shuffled his feet. <quote>Well, actually,
sir, it looked like &mdash; like a bus. A single-decker,</quote> he elaborated.
   <p>Daggers, the Group Captain looked. <quote>Broughtons,</quote> he said
silkily. <quote>Didn't they teach you at Cranwell that buses are
earth-bound creatures? Aeroplanes fly, Broughtons. Buses crawl.</quote>
   <p>Very pale, Broughtons was. But determined. <quote>It was a bus,
sir. They'd got the lights on. There were people inside. Waving.</quote>
   <p>Like gimlets, the Station Commander's eyes. <quote>Did you see the
indicator board?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, sir.</quote>
   <p><quote>And what did it say? Mystery Tour?</quote> Oh, very caustic, that
Group Captain.
   <p>But Broughtons stood his ground. <quote>No, sir. It said
Llangrwl.</quote>
   <p>Llewelyn Jones sat back in his chair. <quote>I see. So you met a bus
at fifty thousand feet. All lit up. Full of people waving as you
went past.</quote> Suddenly he crouched forward. <quote>Broughtons, if I
thought there were anything in Queen's Regulations to cover this, I'd
have you court-martialled. But I know there isn't,</quote> he ended sadly.
   <p><quote>I tried to read the registration number, sir. But it was
getting dark.</quote> He waited. But his commanding officer appeared to
have forgotten him. He saluted, and left the presence, very
crestfallen...
   <p>Time passed. The bus climbed, and went quietly into orbit. Time
passed. The Rev. Edwards' pulpit remained empty. And so did the
arms of Dai Pugh. How could they be otherwise, when his beloved was
circling the Poles at three-and-a-quarter-hour intervals, regular as
clockwork?
   <p>Time passed. Everyone said, ~<quote>Pity about Megan Thomas, isn't
it,</quote> as though they didn't really think it was a pity at all; as,
indeed, they didn't.
   <p>LOCAL BUS DISAPPEARS
   <p>announced the Dinas Advertiser. But the London papers
ignored the whole affair.
   <p>Ifor Evans reported his loss to the police. But they only
tut-tutted. <quote>Lost a bus, is it. Very careless.</quote> That was their
attitude. Now if there'd been a good old accident, they could have
measured up the road and taken an interest. But losing a bus! People
were always losing things. You'd be surprised, they said.
   <p>So it seemed, for a time, that the whole affair would be written
off as one of those unexplained mysteries, like the Marie Celeste.
Then things began to happen...
   <p>But what about the voyagers? you will be asking.
   <p>Well, the Rev. Edwards had taken command. <quote>Our position,</quote>
he said, <quote>is somewhat analogous to that of a castaway on a desert
island. Now what does such a person do? He signals his position by
lighting bonfires or hoisting a flag on a palm tree. And he tries to
ensure a supply of food.</quote>
   <p><quote>Can't go lighting bonfires on this bus,</quote> the conductor said
firmly. <quote>Contrary to the Company's Regulations.</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course not,</quote> agreed the minister. <quote>No, we have another
way of signalling our position. The driver must sound his horn
continuously.</quote>
   <p>Gave him a look, the driver did. <quote>Where you think we are?</quote> he
asked rudely. <quote>Dinas High Street?</quote>
   <p><quote>Do as I say, driver.</quote> Very stern, the reverend gentleman
was.
   <p>So the driver peep-peeped as though he were edging his way
through a herd of cows, instead of hurtling through empty space.
<quote>Thank you,</quote> the Rev. Edwards said courteously.
   <p><quote>Secondly, we must pool and ration our supplies of food, if
any.</quote> He looked at Price the Provisions, who was nursing a great
basket. <quote>Now, who has any food?</quote> he asked hopefully.
   <p>Stared back did Price the Provisions, unwinking.
   <p><quote>Mr. Price, I think you may be able to help us here,</quote> said
the Rev. Edwards.
   <p>Price shook his head. <quote>Intended for Plas Newydd, this lot is.
Paid for, too.</quote> He folded his arms protectively over the basket.
   <p>Mutinous dog, thought the Rev. Edwards, who hadn't enjoyed
himself so much since reading Treasure Island. <quote>What have you
got in that basket, Price?</quote> he roared.
   <p>Quelled, Mr. Price pulled out a grocery list, pushed his
glasses up on his nose, and began to read. <quote>Six loaves, four pounds
butter, two pounds marge, one tin pineapple, one York ham.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then we are saved,</quote> cried the Rev. Edwards.
   <p>Shyly, Morfydd Owen produced a block of chocolate.

   <p>This is a story of a space-ship commander who faces an inspection
by an Inspector of Stores &mdash; and the Inspector is a Rear-Admiral who
cannot bear the thought of a space-ship that is short of even the most
minute item of equipment. The commander discovers he is short of an
<squote>offog</squote>. That is bad enough. But he himself doesn't know what
an <squote>offog</squote> is!
   <p>
   <p>IT was a long time since the Bustler had been so silent.
She lay in the Sirian spaceport, her tubes cold, her shell
particle-scarred, her air that of a long-distance runner exhausted at
the end of a marathon. There was good reason for this: she had
returned from a lengthy trip by no means devoid of troubles.
   <p>Now, in port, well-deserved rest had been gained if only
temporarily. Peace, sweet peace. No more bothers, no more crises, no
more major upsets, no more dire predicaments such as crop up in free
flight at least twice a day. Just peace.
   <p>Hah!
   <p>Captain McNaught reposed in his cabin, feet up on desk, and
enjoyed the relaxation to the utmost. The engines were dead, their
hellish pounding absent for the first time in months. Out there in
the big city four hundred of his crew were making whoopee under a
brilliant sun. This evening, when First Officer Gregory returned to
take charge, he was going to go into the fragrant twilight to make the
rounds of neon-lit civilization.
   <p>That was the beauty of making landfall at long last. Men could
give way to themselves, blow off surplus steam, each according to his
fashion. No duties, no worries, no dangers, no responsibilities in
spaceport. A haven of safety and comfort for tired rovers.
   <p>Again, Hah!
   <p>Burman, the chief radio officer, entered the cabin. He was one
of the half-dozen remaining on duty and bore the expression of a man
who can think of twenty better things to do.
   <p><squote>Relayed signal just come in sir.</squote> Handing the paper across
he waited for the other to look at it and perhaps dictate a reply.
   <p>Taking the sheet McNaught removed the feet from his desk, sat
erect and read the message aloud.

   <p>Terran Headquarters to Bustler. Remain Siriport pending
further orders. Rear Admiral Vane W. Cassidy due there seventeenth.
Feldman. Navy Op. Command. Sirisec.

   <p>He looked up, all happiness gone from his leathery features.
<squote>Oh, Lord!</squote> he groaned.
   <p><squote>Something wrong?</squote> asked Burman, vaguely alarmed.
   <p>McNaught pointed at three thin books on his desk. <squote>The middle
one. Page twenty.</squote>
   <p>Leafing through it, Burman found an item that said:

   <p>Vane W. Cassidy, R-Ad. Head Inspector Ships and Stores.

   <p>Burman swallowed hard. <squote>Does that mean &mdash; ?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes, it does,</squote> said McNaught without pleasure. <squote>Back to
training-college and all its rigmarole. Paint and soap, spit and
polish.</squote> He put on an officious expression, adopted a voice to
match it. <squote>Captain, you have only seven-ninety-nine emergency
rations. Your allocation is eight hundred. Nothing in your logbook
accounts for the missing one. Where is it? What happened to it? How
is it that one of the men's kit lacks an officially-issued pair of
suspenders? Did you report his loss?</squote>
   <p><squote>Why does he pick on us?</squote> asked Burman, appalled. <squote>He's
never chivvied us before.</squote>
   <p><squote>That's why,</squote> informed McNaught, scowling at the wall. <squote>It's
our turn to be stretched across the barrel.</squote> His gaze found the
calendar. <squote>We have three days &mdash; and we'll need 'em! Tell Second
Officer Pike to come here at once.</squote>
   <p>Burman departed gloomily. In a short time Pike entered. His
face reaffirmed the old adage that bad news travels fast.
   <p><squote>Make out an indent,</squote> ordered McNaught, <squote>for one hundred
gallons of plastic paint, Navy-grey, approved quality. Make out
another for thirty gallons of interior white enamel. Take them to
spaceport stores right away. Tell them to deliver by six this evening
along with our correct issue of brushes and sprayers. Grab up any
cleaning material that's going for free.</squote>
   <p><squote>The men won't like this,</squote> remarked Pike feebly.
   <p><squote>They're going to love it,</squote> McNaught asserted. <squote>A bright and
shiny ship, all spic and span, is good for morale. It says so in the
book. Get moving and put those indents in. When you come back, find
the stores and equipment sheets and bring them here. We've got to
check stocks before Cassidy arrives. Once he's here we'll have no
chance to make up shortages or smuggle out any extra items we happened
to find on our hands.</squote>
   <p><squote>Very well, sir.</squote> Pike went out wearing the same expression
as Burman's.
   <p>Lying back in his chair McNaught muttered to himself. There was
a feeling in his bones that something was sure to cause a last minute
ruckus.
   <p>A shortage on any item would be serious enough unless covered by
a previous report. A surplus would be bad, very bad. The former
implied carelessness or misfortune. The latter suggested barefaced
theft of government property in circumstances condoned by the
commander.
   <p>For instance, there was the recent case of Williams of the heavy
cruiser Swift. He'd heard of it over the spacevine when out
around Bootes. Williams had been found in unwitting command of eleven
reels of electric-fence wire when his official issue was ten. It had
taken a court-martial to decide that the extra reel &mdash; which had
formidable barter-value on a certain planet &mdash; had not been stolen from
space-stores or, in sailor jargon, <squote>teleportated aboard</squote>. But
Williams had been reprimanded. And that did not help promotion.
   <p>He was still rumbling discontentedly when Pike returned bearing a
folder of foolscap sheets.
   <p><squote>Going to start right away, sir?</squote>
   <p><squote>We'll have to.</squote> He heaved himself erect, mentally bidded
 good-bye to time off and a taste of the bright lights.
<squote>It'll take long enough to work right through from bow to tail. I'll
leave the men's kit inspections to the last.</squote>
   <p>Marching out of the cabin, he set forth towards the bow, Pike
following with broody reluctance.
   <p>As they passed the open main-lock Peaslake observed them, bounded
eagerly up the gangway and joined behind. A pukka member of the crew,
he was a large dog whose ancestors had been more enthusiastic than
selective. He wore with pride a big collar inscribed: Peaslake &mdash;
Property of S.S. Bustler. His chief duties, ably performed,
were to keep alien rodents off the ship and, on rare occasions, smell
out dangers not visible to human eyes.
   <p>The three paraded forward, McNaught and Pike in the manner of men
grimly sacrificing pleasure for the sake of duty, Peaslake with the
panting willingness of one ready for any new game no matter what.
   <p>Reaching the bow-cabin, McNaught dumped himself in the pilot's
seat, took the folder from the other. <squote>You know this stuff better
than me &mdash; the chart room is where I shine. So I'll read them out
while you look them over.</squote> He opened the folder, started on the
front page. <squote>K1. Beam Compass, type D, one of.</squote>
   <p><squote>Check,</squote> said Pike. <squote>K2. Distance and direction indicator,
electronic type JJ, one of.</squote>
   <p><squote>Check.</squote>
   <p>Peaslake planted his head in McNaught's lap, blinked soulfully
and whined. He was beginning to get the others' viewpoint. This
tedious itemizing and checking was a hell of a game. McNaught
consolingly lowered a hand and played with Peaslake's ears while he
ploughed his way down the list.
   <p><squote>K187. Foam rubber cushions, pilot and co-pilot, one pair.</squote>
   <p><squote>Check.</squote>
   <p>By the time First Officer Gregory appeared they had reached the
tiny intercom-cubby and poked around it in semi-darkness. Peaslake
had long departed in disgust. <squote>M24. Spare minispeakers, three-inch
type T2, one set of six.</squote>
   <p><squote>Check.</squote>
   <p>Looking in, Gregory popped his eyes and said, <squote>What the devil
is going on?</squote>
   <p><squote>Major inspection due soon.</squote> McNaught glanced at his watch.
<squote>Go see if stores has delivered a load and if not why not. Then
you'd better give me a hand and let Pike take a few hours off.</squote>
   <p><squote>Does this mean land-leave is cancelled?</squote>
   <p><squote>You bet it does &mdash; until after Hizonner has been and gone.</squote>
He glanced at Pike. <squote>When you get into the city search around and
send back any of the crew you can find. No arguments or excuses.
It's an order.</squote>
   <p>Pike registered unhappiness. Gregory glowered at him, went away,
came back and said, <squote>Stores will have the stuff here in twenty
minutes' time.</squote> With bad grace he watched Pike depart.
   <p><squote>M47. Intercom cable, woven-wire protected, three drums.</squote>
   <p><squote>Check,</squote> said Gregory, mentally kicking himself for returning
at the wrong time.
   <p>The task continued until late in the evening, was resumed early
next morning. By that time three-quarters of the men were hard at
work inside and outside the vessel, doing their jobs as though
sentenced to them for crimes contemplated but not yet committed.
   <p>Moving around the ship's corridors and catwalks had to be done
crab-fashion, with a nervous sidewise edging. Once again it was being
demonstrated that the Terran life-form suffers from ye fear of
wette paynt. The first smearer would have ten years willed off
his unfortunate life.
   <p>It was in these conditions, in mid-afternoon of the second day,
that McNaught's bones proved their feelings had been prophetic.
   <p>He recited the ninth page while Jean Blanchard confirmed the
presence and actual existence of all items enumerated. Two-thirds of
the way down they hit the rocks, metaphorically speaking, and
commenced to sink fast.
   <p>McNaught said boredly, <squote>V1097. Drinking-bowl, enamel, one
of.</squote> <squote>Is zis,</squote> said Blanchard, tapping it. <squote>V1098.
Offog, one.</squote>
   <p><squote>\Quoi?</squote> asked Blanchard, staring.
   <p><squote>V1098. Offog, one,</squote> repeated McNaught. <squote>Well, why are
you looking thunderstruck? This is the ship's galley. You're the
head cook. You know what's supposed to be in the galley, don't you?
Where's this offog?</squote>
   <p><squote>Never hear of heem,</squote> said Blanchard, flatly.
   <p><squote>You must have done. It's on this equipment-sheet in plain,
clear type. Offog, one, it says. It was here when we were
fitted-out four years ago. We checked it ourselves and signed for
it.</squote>
   <p><squote>I signed for nossings called offog,</squote> Blanchard denied.
<squote>In zee cuisine zere is no such sing.</squote>
   <p><squote>Look!</squote> McNaught scowled and showed him the sheet.
   <p>Blanchard looked and sniffed disdainfully. <squote>I have here zee
electronic oven, one of. I have jacketed boilers, graduated
capacities, one set. I have bain marie pans, seex of. But no offog.
Never heard of heem. I do not know of heem.</squote> He spread his
hands and shrugged. <squote>No offog.</squote>
   <p><squote>There's got to be,</squote> McNaught insisted. <squote>What's more, when
Cassidy arrives there'll be hell to pay if there isn't.</squote>
   <p><squote>You find heem,</squote> Blanchard suggested.
   <p><squote>You got a certificate from the International Hotels School of
Cookery. You got a certificate from the Cordon Bleu College of
Cuisine. You got a certificate with three credits from the Space-Navy
Feeding Centre,</squote> McNaught pointed out. <squote>All that &mdash; and you don't
know what an offog is.</squote>
   <p><squote>Nom d'un chien!</squote> ejaculated Blanchard, waving his
arms around. <squote>I tell you ten t'ousand time zere is no offog.
Zere never was an offog. Escoffier heemself could not find zee offog
of vich zere is none. Am I a magician perhaps?</squote>
   <p><squote>It's part of the culinary equipment,</squote> McNaught maintained.
<squote>It must be because it's on page nine. And page nine means its
proper home is in the galley, care of the head cook.</squote>
   <p><squote>Like hail it does,</squote> Blanchard retorted. He pointed at a
metal box on the wall. <squote>Intercom booster. Is zat mine?</squote>
   <p>McNaught thought it over, conceded, <squote>No, it's Burman's. His
stuff rambles all over the ship.</squote>
   <p><squote>Zen ask him for zis offog,</squote> said Blanchard,
triumphantly.
   <p><squote>I will. If it's not yours it must be his. Let's finish this
checking first.</squote> His eyes sought the list. <squote>V1099. Inscribed
collar, leather, brass studded, dog, for the use of. No need to look
for that. I saw it myself five minutes ago.</squote> He ticked the item,
continued, <squote>V1100. Sleeping basket, woven reed, one of.</squote>
   <p><squote>Is zis,</squote> said Blanchard, kicking it into a corner.
   <p><squote>V1101. Cushion, foam rubber, to fit sleeping basket, one
of.</squote>
   <p><squote>Half of,</squote> Blanchard contradicted. <squote>In four years he have
chewed away other half.</squote>
   <p><squote>Maybe Cassidy will let us indent for a new one.
<QUOTE>

<text id=LOBM06>
   <p>The Captives were painful to look on. All had some kind of
deformity. One had no legs. One had no flesh on his lower jaw. One
had four gnarled dwarf arms. One had short wings of flesh connecting
ear lobes and thumbs, so that he lived perpetually with hands half
raised to his face. One had boneless arms trailing at his side and
one boneless leg. One had monstrous wings which trailed about him
like a carpet. One was hiding his ill-shaped form away behind a
screen of his own excrement, smearing it onto the transparent walls of
his cell. And one had a second head, a small wizened thing growing
from the first that fixed Lily-yo with a malevolent eye. This last
Captive, who seemed to lead the others, spoke now, using the mouth of
his main head.
   <p><squote>I am the Chief Captive. I greet you. You are of the Heavy
World. We are of the True World. Now you join us because you are of
us. Though your wings and your scars are new, you may join us.</squote>
   <p><squote>I am Lily-yo. We three are humans. You are only flymen. We
will not join you.</squote>
   <p>The Captives grunted in boredom. The Chief Captive spoke again.
   <p><squote>Always this talk from you of the Heavy World! You have
joined us. You are flymen, we are human. You know little, we know
much.</squote>
   <p><squote>But we &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Stop your stupid talk, woman!</squote>
   <p><squote>We are &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Be silent, woman, and listen,</squote> Band Appa Bondi said.
   <p><squote>We know much,</squote> repeated the Chief Captive. <squote>Some things we
will tell you. All who make the journey from the Heavy World become
changed. Some die. Most live and grow wings. Between the worlds are
many strong rays, not seen or felt, which change our bodies. When you
come here, when you come to the True World, you become a true human.
The grub of the tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes. So
humans change.</squote>
   <p><squote>I cannot know what he says,</squote> Haris said stubbornly, throwing
himself down. But Lily-yo and Flor were listening.
   <p><squote>To this True World, as you call it, we come to die,</squote> Lily-yo
said, doubtingly.
   <p>The Captive with the fleshless jaw said, <squote>The grub of the
tigerfly thinks it dies when it changes into a tigerfly.</squote>
   <p><squote>You are still young,</squote> said the Chief Captive. <squote>You begin
newly here. Where are your souls?</squote>
   <p>Lily-yo and Flor looked at each other. In their flight from the
wiltmilt they had heedlessly thrown down their souls. Haris had
trampled on his. It was unthinkable!
   <p><squote>You see. You needed them no more. You are still young. You
may be able to have babies. Some of those babies may be born with
wings.</squote>
   <p>The Captive with the boneless arms added, <squote>Some may be born
wrong, as we are. Some may be born right.</squote>
   <p><squote>You are too foul to live!</squote> Haris growled. <squote>Why are you not
killed?</squote>
   <p><squote>Because we know all things,</squote> the Chief Captive said.
Suddenly his second head roused itself and declared, <squote>To be a good
shape is not all in life. To know is also good. Because we cannot
move well we can &mdash; think. This tribe of the True World is good
and knows these things. So it lets us rule it.</squote>
   <p>Flor and Lily-yo muttered together.
   <p><squote>Do you say that you poor Captives rule the True World?</squote>
Lily-yo asked at last.
   <p><squote>We do.</squote>
   <p><squote>Then why are you captives?</squote>
   <p>The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected, making his
perpetual little gesture of protest, spoke for the first time.
   <p><squote>To rule is to serve, woman. Those who bear power are slaves to
it. Only an outcast is free. Because we are Captives, we have the
time to talk and think and plan and know. Those who know command the
knives of others.</squote>
   <p><squote>No hurt will come to you, Lily-yo,</squote> Band Appa Bondi added.
<squote>You will live among us and enjoy your life free from harm.</squote>
   <p><squote>No!</squote> the Chief Captive said with both mouths. <squote>Before she
can enjoy, Lily-yo and her companion Flor &mdash; this other man creature is
plainly useless &mdash; must help our great plan.</squote>
   <p><squote>The invasion?</squote> Bondi asked.
   <p><squote>What else? Flor and Lily-yo, you arrive here at a good time.
Memories of the Heavy World and its savage life are still fresh in
you. We need such memories. So we ask you to go back there on a
great plan we have.</squote>
   <p><squote>Go back?</squote> gasped Flor.
   <p><squote>Yes. We plan to attack the Heavy World. You must help to lead
our force.</squote>
<head>6</head>
   <p>The long afternoon of eternity wore on, that long golden road
of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to everlasting night.
Motion there was, but motion without event &mdash; except for those
negligible events that seemed so large to the creatures participating
in them.
   <p>For Lily-yo, Flor and Haris there were many events. Chief of
these was that they learned to fly properly.
   <p>The pains associated with their wings soon died away as the
wonderful new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the light
gravity became an increasing delight &mdash; the ugly flopping movements of
flymen on the Heavy World had no place here.
   <p>They learned to fly in packs, and then to hunt in packs. In time
they were trained to carry out the Captives' plan.
   <p>The series of accidents that had first delivered humans to this
world in burnurns had been a fortunate one, growing more fortunate as
millennia tolled away. For gradually the humans adapted better to the
True World. Their survival factor became greater, their power surer.
And all this as on the Heavy World conditions grew more and more
adverse to anything but the giant vegetables.
   <p>Lily-yo at least was quick to see how much easier life was in
these new conditions. She sat with Flor and a dozen others eating
pulped pluggyrugg, before they did the Captives' bidding and left
for the Heavy World.
   <p>It was hard to express all she felt.
   <p><squote>Here we are safe,</squote> she said, indicating the whole green land
that sweltered under the silver network of webs.
   <p><squote>Except from the tigerflies,</squote> Flor agreed.
   <p>They rested on a bare peak, where the air was thin and even the
giant creepers had not climbed. The turbulent green stretched away
below them, almost as if they were on Earth &mdash; although here it was
continually checked by the circular formations of rock.
   <p><squote>This world is smaller,</squote> Lily-yo said, trying again to make
Flor know what was in her head. <squote>Here we are much bigger. We do not
need to fight so much.</squote>
   <p><squote>Soon we must fight.</squote>
   <p><squote>Then we can come back here again. This is a good place, with
nothing so savage and with not so many enemies. Here the groups could
live without so much fear. Veggy and Toy and May and Gren and the
other little ones would like it here.</squote>
   <p><squote>They would miss the trees.</squote>
   <p><squote>We shall soon miss the trees no longer. We have wings
instead.</squote>
   <p>This idle talk took place beneath the unmoving shadow of a rock.
Overhead, silver blobs against a purple sky, the transversers went,
walking their networks, descending only occasionally to the celeries
far below. As Lily-yo fell to watching these creatures, she thought
in her mind of the grand plan the Captives had hatched, she flicked it
over in a series of vivid pictures.
   <p>Yes, the Captives knew. They could see ahead as she could not.
She and those about her had lived like plants, doing what came. The
Captives were not plants. From their cells they saw more than those
outside.
   <p>This, the Captives saw: that the few humans who reached the True
World bore few children, because they were old, or because the rays
that made their wings grow made their seeds die: that it was good
here, and would be better still with more humans; that one way to get
more humans here was to bring babies and children from the Heavy
World.
   <p>For countless time, this had been done. Brave flymen had
travelled back to that other world and stolen children. The flymen
who had once attacked Lily-yo's group on their climb to the Tips had
been on that mission. They had taken Bain to bring her to the True
World in burnurns &mdash; and had not been heard of since.
   <p>Many perils and mischances lay in that long double journey. Of
those who set out, few returned.
   <p>Now the Captives had thought of a better and more daring scheme.
   <p><squote>Here comes a traverser,</squote> Band Appa Bondi said. <squote>Let us be
ready to move.</squote>
   <p>He walked before the pack of twelve flyers who had been chosen
for this new attempt. He was the leader. Lily-yo, Flo and Haris were
in support of him, together with eight others, three male, five
female. Only one of them, Band Appa Bondi himself, had been carried
to the True World as a boy.
   <p>Slowly the pack stood up, stretching their wings. The moment for
their great adventure was here. Yet they felt little fear; they could
not look ahead as the Captives did, except perhaps for Band Appa Bondi
and Lily-yo. She strengthened her will by saying, <squote>It is the
way.</squote> Then they all spread their arms wide and soared off to meet
the traverser.
   <p>
   <p>The traverser had eaten.
   <p>It had caught one of its most tasty enemies, a tigerfly, in a
web, and had sucked it till only a shell was left. Now it sank down
into a bed of celeries, crushing them under its great bulk. Gently,
it began to bud. Afterwards, it would head out for the great black
gulfs, where heat and radiance called it. It had been born on this
world. Being young, it had never yet made that dreaded, desired
journey.
   <p>Its buds burst up from its back, hung over, popped, fell to the
ground, and scurried away to bury themselves in the pulp and dirt
where they might begin their ten thousand years' growth in peace.
   <p>Young though it was, the traverser was sick. It did not know
this. The enemy tigerfly had been at it, but it did not know this.
Its vast bulk held little sensation.
   <p>The twelve humans glided down and landed on its back, low down on
the abdomen in a position hidden from the creature's cluster of eyes.
They sank among the tough shoulder-high fibres that served the
traverser as hair, and looked about them. A ray-plane swooped
overhead and disappeared. A trio of tumbleweeds skittered into the
fibres and were seen no more. All was as quiet as if they lay on a
small deserted hill.
   <p>At length they spread out and moved along in a line, heads down,
eyes searching, Band Appa Bondi at one end, Lily-yo at the other. The
great body was streaked and pitted and scarred, so that progress down
the slope was not easy. The fibre grew in patterns of different
shades, green, yellow, black, breaking up the traverser's bulk when
seen from the air, serving it as natural camouflage. In many places,
tough parasitic plants had rooted themselves, drawing their
nourishment entirely from their host; most of them would die when the
traverser launched itself out between worlds.
   <p>The humans worked hard. Once they were thrown flat when the
traverser changed position. As the slope down which they moved grew
steeper, so progress became more slow.
   <p><squote>Here!</squote> cried Y Coyin, one of the women.
   <p>At last they had found what they sought, what the Captives sent
them to seek.
   <p>Clustering round Y Coyin with their knives out, the pack looked
down.
   <p>Here the fibres had been neatly champed away in swathes, leaving
a bare patch as far across as a human was long. In this patch was a
round scab. Lily-yo felt it. It was immensely hard.
   <p>Lo Jint put his ear to it. Silence.
   <p>They looked at each other.
   <p>No signal was needed, none given.
   <p>Together they knelt, prising with their knives round the scab.
Once the traverser moved, and they threw themselves flat.

   <p>Alastair was a bachelor. All his life he had been inclined to
regard women as something which must necessarily be subordinated to
his career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only his own
life, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl whom he had never met
and on whom after no more than a couple of telephone calls he was
prepared to place complete reliance. It was a novel experience.
Alastair was quite unable to explain why he should feel so much
confidence in her.
   <p>Once again she checked back her instructions. It was obvious
that she did not fail to appreciate the faith which he was placing in
her and was prepared to accept the responsibility.
   <p><quote>Good luck, Air Marshal,</quote> she said gently. <quote>I'll be waiting
for you at the Hotel Roma at six this evening &mdash; and I shall look
forward to meeting you both at midnight.</quote> They might have been
arranging a supper party. Then she rang off. Alastair admitted that
never in a not altogether uneventful life had he come across a girl
who sounded so charming and appeared to be so efficient.
   <p>He looked forward to meeting her.
<head>Chapter Ten</head>
   <p>It was a perfect moonlight night; there appeared to be no cloud
over the whole of Europe. From a height of 50,000 feet northern Italy
strikingly resembled the great relief map which covers the floor of
the southern Europe briefing room at NATO headquarters.
   <p>Seated beside Alastair, lulled by the uncanny silence of
supersonic flight, Geoffrey could imagine himself in one of the upper
galleries. For some reason the orderlies had forgotten to switch on
the lights; there was no colour &mdash; physical features were
distinguishable solely by gradations of silvery greyness. Even the
snow-capped summit of Mont Blanc, seven miles below, was not
recognisable among the host of lower peaks.
   <p>The screen of the air-to-air radar glowed. Occasionally minute
spots flickered across its surface, but there was no permanent image.
The sky seemed to be deserted.
   <p>Alastair leant across and pressed a switch. A tiny red light
sprang into life, only to fade as the screen of the second radar
scanner came into operation. This was the ground definition unit.
Although Geoffrey had relatively little experience of interpreting
radar pictures, he was able to recognise the land beneath him. In the
exceptional clarity he was even able to make a direct comparison
between the radar image and the ground itself. Ahead lay the Plain of
Lombardy; to the right, Turin; to the left, Milan.
   <p>The directional angle of the scanner could be adjusted to cover
any particular area within its range. Geoffrey turned the scale
slowly to cover the ground immediately ahead. He was able to pick out
towns, unrecognisable to the naked eye, obscured by the ground haze
which even on the clearest night limited angular vision.
   <p>He glanced at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible
that the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle was resting
could really mean hundreds of knots. They were flying at more than
975 miles an hour, or nearly Mach 1.3 to use the modern jargon.
Thanks to the massive cooling plant there was no suggestion of
excessive heat.
   <p>Suddenly the nature of the silence changed. During the fifty-odd
minutes since they had left Boscombe Down, Geoffrey had become so
accustomed to the unbroken note of the great engines that they were no
longer audible. Now, as Alastair reduced the thrust, the pitch
changed as the nose of the aircraft dipped slightly. The needle of
the speed recorder swung gently through 8.0, 7.0, 6.0 before coming to
rest at 5.0.
   <p><quote>We're a bit ahead of time,</quote> said Alastair. <quote>We'll run in on
minimum engine power.</quote>
   <p>Geoffrey smiled. Alastair talked of running in when they were
still more than four hundred miles from their destination.
   <p>They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner on
the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port. He was able to
trace the course of the river; he thought he could recognise the route
of N12, along which he had motored so desperately little more than
twenty-four hours earlier. Since then he had flown to England,
attended the vital conference in Bruce Denton's office, been whisked
by special helicopter from the Horse Guards Parade to Boscombe Down,
slept for six blessed refreshing hours and had now completed
two-thirds of the journey back to the place where every indication
pointed to Eve being held.
   <p>Geoffrey set himself to consider the movements of the Bentley.
It had passed him at the temporary bridge over the Tartaro at a few
minutes past ten on the previous night. He worked out the distance on
the presumption that its route had been through Florence and Rome and
then across Italy via Foggia to Barletta. It came to just over six
hundred miles.
   <p>Provided they did not stop (and with Eve unconscious &mdash; or worse &mdash;
they would be anxious to avoid attracting attention), and if they
drove as fast as the roads would permit, they could not hope to reach
Barletta before midday. Magnificent as was the performance of the
Bentley, Geoffrey doubted whether on the route they had chosen,
involving a double crossing of the Apennines &mdash; once at Raticosa over
the Futa Pass and once again near Campobasso &mdash; anyone could maintain
the average of forty miles an hour which would be necessary. Far more
probable that they would travel more leisurely.
   <p>Of course they could have bound and gagged her; and provided no
one examined what was hidden under the rug, they might get by. But
they could hardly leave her in the car while they rested. No, he
concluded, the probability was that they would drive continuously,
only stopping for fuel and perhaps to purchase snacks of food and
drink. They might not reach Foggia until late at night; it was even
conceivable he would arrive before them.
   <p>Geoffrey forced himself to consider another possible alternative.
Eve might be dead. If so, why had they troubled to bring her body
all the way from Trento? There were a hundred places between Trento
and the Po where they could have dumped her body without fear of it
being prematurely discovered. He had used one of them himself to
dispose of Stefano and Pietro. He determined to act on the assumption
that Eve was alive.
   <p>He tried to imagine what the Italians would do next. Their final
objective could only be to deliver Eve to Herring's headquarters,
which in the light of the information he had gleaned at the morning's
conference and of Gloria Falcon's story appeared to be somewhere in
the Gargano Massif. Of course he was assuming that the man
responsible for the aircraft, for Peter Lambert's injuries and for the
abduction of Eve was one and the same person &mdash; in fact, Herring.
   <p>Nothing was certain. All the deductions on which he was planning
might be false. The men who had captured Eve might have taken her
anywhere but to Barletta, but to speculate on the innumerable
alternatives was to invite confusion. Far better to adhere to the one
course which in the light of his present knowledge seemed most
probable, while at the same time keeping keenly alert for any
additional information which might prove to be of help.
   <p>Gloria Falcon was the key to the whole operation. On what she
could report of her conversation with Peter Lambert depended ultimate
success. Geoffrey had had no contact with her but Alastair seemed to
have developed a tremendous admiration for her intelligence.
   <p>During the earlier part of their flight from Boscombe Down he had
repeated the gist of his third conversation with her.
   <p>Gloria had been waiting at the Hotel Roma when punctually at 6
the call from Alastair came through. He found that she had done all
and more than he had asked of her. She had managed to get hold of a
Lancia Rapido &mdash; just the car for the job: fast and at the same time
with a first-class performance over rough going. She had examined
every inch of the runway and found it quite serviceable, although, as
Alastair had feared, the whole landing area was obstructed by grazing
cattle. Gloria had visited the farmer, told him that a high-level
inspecting officer from the Italian Ministry of Aviation was proposing
to land on the strip during the night and that it was as much as his
life was worth to allow his cattle to be the cause of an accident.
   <p>Gloria had laughed when she told him how she had accounted for
the impending visit of the official from the Ministry.
   <p><quote>I hinted,</quote> she said, <quote>that he and I were having an affaire
and only by making this desperate landing at night could he avoid the
suspicions of his wife. Every Italian is a romantic. He promised
that nothing should be allowed to increase the danger of our
meeting.</quote>
   <p>Gloria emphasised that even a slight mishap would draw attention
to him being in the district and would be disastrous not only for her
but for his career, and, she added significantly, for those
responsible for obstructing the runway.
   <p>Within an hour the strip was completely clear; a horde of the
farmer's family and all his workpeople hastened to remove not only the
cattle but every trace of their presence. Gloria admitted that she
had not intended to initiate quite so much activity, but once she had
told her story there was no way of going back on it.
   <p><quote>I have arranged,</quote> concluded Alastair, <quote>for her to have the
car at the point where the 14-kilometre stone track meets the
runway. It is about a hundred yards from the southern end; so that if
all goes well we shall come to a stop quite near her.</quote>
   <p>Geoffrey was impressed by the efficiency with which Alastair
managed to surround himself. In his Service he was known to be
ruthless to incompetence, but he seldom had any difficulty in
recruiting precisely the staff he needed. He possessed the strange
gift of leadership which enabled him to imbue even an unknown film
actress with all the qualities of efficiency and decision which he
took as a matter of course among his own officers. Geoffrey
remembered that a famous field marshal, inclined to pontificate, had
once stated that a headquarters staff reflected the quality of its
commander. It certainly seemed to apply to Alastair.
   <p>Now the N.F.E. 67 was losing height more rapidly.
Alastair had decided to make the final approach to the airstrip at a
very low level over the sea. He crossed the coast a few miles south
of Ancona and almost immediately made a steep turn to starboard. Now
he was flying at less than a hundred feet, about five miles off the
coast.
   <p><quote>I bet the radar boys are worried,</quote> he laughed. <quote>They'll
have lost us by now and will be wondering where we've got to.</quote>
   <p>Geoffrey glanced at his watch; it was eighteen minutes to
midnight; just one hundred and seven minutes since they had left
Boscombe Down.
   <p><quote>We'll land in five minutes,</quote> Alastair announced. <quote>I'd like
you to be as quick as you can. Chuck your flying kit into the back of
the aircraft and I'll get weaving. The sooner I can show up on their
radar screens the better. This is a very hush-hush job and we don't
want to create alarm and despondency by giving them the idea that I've
skipped with it to the wrong side of the Curtain. If they spotted us
flying due east over Ancona, it might give them ideas.</quote>
   <p>The landing was easier than either of them had dared to hope.
The old landing strip, perhaps helped by the spring-cleaning which it
had undergone during the afternoon, shone like black glass in the
moonlight. Alastair came in very fast, but within less than half a
mile the machine rolled to a halt. He cut the engines and flung open
the canopy.

<head>CHAPTER 16</head>
   <p>DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the time they docked
at Belleray. And though Guy, made nervous by Beryl's silence, drove
at reckless speed to the Villa, it was quickly evident that the party
was over.
   <p>Piers came strolling out to meet the Deanes, and as soon as Guy
had driven away, invited them casually to come to his flat for a
drink.
   <p>To Beryl, at least, this was anti-climax with a vengeance. She
had expected to be met with violent reproaches &mdash; and here he was bland
and smiling.
   <p>But it did not take her long to realise that his mood was less
pleasant than appeared on the surface.
   <p>He told her nonchalantly, as he led the way to his own veranda,
that he had taken the liberty of asking Jack &mdash; as a representative of
the Vallin family &mdash; to come over and make the presentation in her
stead.
   <p><quote>I caught him just as he was going to the airport to meet
Blanche,</quote> he said. <quote>As a matter of fact I'd asked him last night
to deputise for me and fetch her. He brought her to the party too.
They're both here.</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't know she was coming back from Barbados so soon.</quote>
Beryl said the first thing that came into her head.
   <p><quote>Oh, she was due!</quote> And then he added in the same casual tone,
<quote>She's not returning to her family. She's going to live with
friends of the bank manager, just this side of Belleray.</quote> Mrs.
Deane made a suitable comment, but Beryl said nothing. She was trying
to sort things out in her mind. That beneath his unnaturally smooth
exterior Piers was simmering with anger against her she had no doubt.
But hadn't she cause for anger too? Had he acted within his rights
in inviting Jack Vallin to act on her behalf, in having Blanche
there &mdash; not doing the honours, perhaps, but as the only white woman of
position?
   <p>Be this as it might, she must on no account show resentment now,
and she greeted Jack and Blanche with friendly courtesy, thanking Jack
warmly for coming to the rescue, and explaining as best she could how
it was that she had been obliged to miss the celebrations.
   <p>Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise, and to express their
disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment of his guests. But Piers
remained aloof, and when Beryl suggested having a second party, the
following week, he poured cold water on the project.
   <p>Everyone, he declared, had had a thoroughly good time, and it
would take them nearly to next week to settle down again. Meanwhile
Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-earned gratuity to his
native village at the north of the island. It was all over and done
with.
   <p>
   <p>For the time being Beryl was content to let it go at that, but
she resolved to have it out with Piers when a reasonable opportunity
presented itself.
   <p>He must learn that he could not treat her with injustice and
contempt, ignoring her explanations as though he were a schoolmaster
and she a small, ignorant child.
   <p>He gave her no chance of any private conversation that evening,
for when Blanche and Jack left, he went with them. But next morning
she insisted on his taking her out in the jeep &mdash; to find, if possible,
Hubert and his relations, and tell them of her great disappointment at
being held up in Balicou.
   <p>With an air of resignation he sent Judy, his Boxer, to the back,
and made room for her beside him.
   <p><quote>Is that all you want to do?</quote> he asked, letting in the clutch.
   <p><quote>No; I want to make you understand just what happened about this
Balicou trip,</quote> she returned coldly. <quote>I'm a little tired of being
treated like an ineffective imbecile.</quote>
   <p><quote>And I'm heartily sick of being constantly called to account
for my manners,</quote> he retorted. <quote>What have I done wrong now? I
cover up for you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack to make
the presentation, I run the damned party to the best of my ability &mdash;
saying the sugary things you ought to have been there to say &mdash; and all
you can do is to find fault.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's your superior attitude that riles me.</quote> Beryl was
scarlet with annoyance. <quote>How I happened to be marooned at Balicou
doesn't interest you in the faintest degree. You look as though it
was only what you expected of me, as though I didn't care a hoot about
letting Hubert and his pals down.</quote>
   <p><quote>As your employee it's not my business to understand all the
whys and wherefores of your actions,</quote> he said stiffly. <quote>Still less
to criticise you.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, drop that nonsense, Piers! Be yourself,</quote> she exclaimed,
with mounting exasperation.
   <p><quote>Very well!</quote> He brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
path fringed and shaded by citrus trees. <quote>If you want my true
opinion I'll give it. You made some sort of a protest to Graybury.
I'll give you credit for that. But you didn't press the matter
because, very naturally, you were thoroughly enjoying Forrest's
company in idyllic surroundings.</quote>
   <p><quote>How dare you say such a thing?</quote> she blazed.
   <p><quote>For goodness' sake show a glimmer of reason,</quote> was his equally
indignant rejoinder. <quote>One minute you order me to behave like your
secretary, the next like an uninhibited human being.</quote> And then he
added caustically, <quote>I've only to mention Forrest's name to put you
in a temper. Why not admit that you're in love with the fellow and
have done with it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Because I'm not,</quote> she snapped.
   <p><quote>You expect me to believe that?</quote> There was open mockery in
his tone. <quote>You'll be telling me next that you spent all those hours
together on Balicou without his kissing you.</quote>
   <p>She caught her breath.
   <p><quote>Of all the caddish things to say!</quote>
   <p><quote>Nonsense. If I'd been in his place I'd have kissed you
myself &mdash; good and hard, as I'm tempted to now.</quote>
   <p><quote>You talk as though we were alone on Balicou!</quote> She avoided
his gaze, and tried to ignore that last impertinent remark.
   <p><quote>With four other people &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Whom you never once managed to circumvent.</quote> The mockery in
his voice had deepened. <quote>With all due deference, Miss Deane &mdash; come
off it!</quote>
   <p>She met his eyes then.
   <p><quote>Very well,</quote> she said coolly. <quote>We were alone together for an
hour or two, the first afternoon. And he did kiss me. But if you
think I acquiesced in the delay because I wanted his company &mdash; well,
you're misjudging me badly.</quote>
   <p><quote>You mean that!</quote> His expression had changed. <quote>It wasn't on
his account at all that you allowed Sir John to get away with this &mdash;
this Hitlerish behaviour.</quote>
   <p>She wavered, and at last said slowly, <quote>If you must drag the
truth out of me, I must ask you to regard it as confidential.</quote>
   <p><quote>My dear Beryl, don't tell me anything, if you'd rather not.</quote>
He was clearly startled by her words. <quote>But remember, it was you,
not I, who started this conversation.</quote>
   <p><quote>I know. Absurd as it may seem, I didn't want you to think
badly of me.</quote> She turned away from him to fondle Judy, who, sensing
something amiss, was nudging her in the endeavour to gain her
attention. <quote>The truth is that if I had absolutely insisted on
sailing at the time originally arranged, Sir John would have had it in
for Guy. You see, it was, apparently, through a mistake on Guy's part
that we missed seeing the flamingoes our first morning on the
island.</quote>
   <p><quote>What harm could possibly have come to Forrest through Sir
John's nonsense?</quote> Piers could hardly have spoken with more
contempt. <quote>A bully like that respects anyone who dares to stand up
to him.</quote>
   <p>Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was precisely the
remark she had made to Guy. She said icily, <quote>As you pride yourself
on your knowledge of all the affairs of the island I needn't tell you
that Sir John Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most important
customers.</quote>
   <p><quote>So what? You're not trying to say that Hewson would victimise
Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral courage! He's quite capable
of telling Sir John to take himself and his business to an
unmentionable destination.</quote>
   <p><quote>There's a difference between what a senior and a junior partner
can do,</quote> was her quick reply.
   <p><quote>What they can bring off! I'll admit that. But Forrest might
at least have tried. He's pretty spineless!</quote>
   <p><quote>You think you could have carried more weight with Sir John?</quote>
she enquired cuttingly. <quote>For all your good opinion of yourself, I
doubt it. He's about as easy to push around as &mdash; as a grounded
whale!</quote>
   <p>He had to smile at that, but went on airily, <quote>I'd have made an
attempt to show my lady-love that I put her interests before my own.
I wouldn't have cared to risk her thinking me a selfish weakling.</quote>
   <p>The barb hurt cruelly. For in her heart of hearts Beryl had
resented Guy's apparent indifference to her dilemma &mdash; had come near,
indeed, to despising him.
   <p>But her soreness merely increased her anger with Piers.
   <p><quote>Was it studying my interests to bring your girl friend to my
party for the labourers?</quote> she demanded. <quote>To have her act as
hostess in my absence?</quote>
   <p>He looked at her, not wrathfully now, but quizzically.
   <p><quote>My girl friend, as you call her, remained as much in the
background as even you could wish.</quote> He patted the Boxer's huge
head. <quote>Judy, here, was more forthcoming. In fact, she trotted
round, obviously trying to make everyone feel at home, gazing
reproachfully at the few timid ones who bolted.</quote>
   <p>She was tempted to laugh, but it was as though that barb still
stuck in her quivering flesh.
   <p><quote>You've an answer &mdash; of sorts &mdash; for everything,</quote> she said
shortly. <quote>Personally I've no more to say, so I suggest we get
along.</quote>
   <p>To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses
where Hubert had been living to find the old man stowing in leisurely
fashion his few possessions into a ramshackle and incredibly ancient
car, surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives. Their air of
smiling somnolence showed them to have been guests at yesterday's
celebrations, and their friendly welcome and warm sympathy, as she
explained how she had come to miss the party, made her send a
complacent glance in Piers' direction. What a fuss-box the man was,
she thought impatiently, trying to worry her into the belief that her
failure to appear at a function on the estate was a major error: that
it was the kind of thing that, with these simple folk, spoiled the
master-servant relationship.
   <p>And then she received a jolt.
   <p>Old Hubert, standing beside her, his battered hat in his hand,
his toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin, told her in halting
patois that <quote>Mistah Piers</quote> had explained right at the start
that <quote>Mis' Beryl</quote> would be <quote>plenty, plenty sad</quote> not to be
back at the Villa in time. That it wouldn't be her fault at all.
That she was a lady who, like her Uncle Charles, took the highest
pride in keeping her word. <quote>I could see anudder t'ing,</quote> he
went on in a lower voice, his sunken black eyes twinkling. <quote>He
powerful anxious, poor Mistah Piers. We all know how Balicou Island
dangerous to all kin' o' boats, wid d'ose big, big rocks in an' out o'
de water. He full o' fear you comin' bad harm, Mis Beryl. I see it
in his eyes, even when he smilin' and larkin' wid us. I knowin' him
well, Missie. He always sayin' he one of us, 'cos he born an' bred in
de islands. An' he say for true!</quote>
   <p>This sidelight on Piers had its effect on Beryl. Without taking
it too seriously she found herself regretting some of the sharp things
she had said to him and when, her goodbyes said, she climbed back into
the jeep, preparatory to returning to the Villa, it was with the
resolve to make up her quarrel with him &mdash; to achieve, at least, a
surface peace.

<text id=LOBN03>
   <p><quote>You don't say?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes sir! That's Gene all right. Say, did he tell you what a
rotten deal he's got, and is still gettin' from that Hawley girl he
married? Mr. Goddard, if that woman had treated him half way decent
she would've found out she'd got herself one of them perfect husbands.
But no! She aint got sense enough to see that, even if she is Dan
Hawley's daughter, which personally I think she aint.</quote>
   <p><quote>What do you mean by that, Constable?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, she could be a sort of catch-colt, couldn't she, or some
poor baby Hawley and his wife adopted because they couldn't have any
kids of their own. I tell you, Mr. Goddard, I would lay down my
life for Gene Pelcher, I admire him that much.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I never make it a practice to inquire into a man's
personal or marital affairs, Constable, here is where I turn in.</quote>
   <p>Too dense to recognize this dismissal for what it was, Nick
Newell would have continued the almost one-sided conversation if
Murdock had not called from the platform in front of his store &mdash;
   <p><quote>How you feeling now, Brother Goddard? You look like you were a
little bunged up, from the way you walk.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I will say, Brother Murdock,</quote> Goddard answered with a
sigh, <quote>that the other day when I was out on that rabbit hunt I
overdid myself a little. From now on I am going to walk a little
among the hills every day, extending the length of my walks slightly
each day till I can get myself back in condition among these wonderful
mountains.</quote>
   <p><quote>Now there's a man I'd tie to, if he ever give me the chance,</quote>
the constable told himself happily as Goddard went into the hotel.
<quote>Durned if I don't like him most as much as I like and trust Gene
Pelcher, by jingo, I do! But havin' an official position, I just got
to be close-mouthed in expressin' my opinion of other men.</quote>
   <p>On Poverty Flat, which was a comparatively level stretch of
gravelly ground that had once been part of the lake bed, Orestus
Hancock had had erected one of the finest houses in all the mountain
county. It was large and comfortable and practical, though there were
houses in Geneva that were adorned with more <quote>gingerbread</quote>. He had
not disturbed nature, except close to the house where there were
gravelled walks and a drive turning in to the painted stable and
carriage house at the rear.
   <p>The house itself had a shake hip-roof that covered a wide porch
that extended on both sides and both ends of the building which
contained seven large rooms, in addition to quarters for Willie Kim,
the Chinaman the judge and Bill had brought from San Francisco eight
years before, to serve as cook and housekeeper and sometimes family
consultant and adviser.
   <p>The wide veranda was not only screened all around, it had hinged
windows that could be raised or lowered as weather conditions
dictated. Now as the judge sat in a large easy chair on the front
portion of this veranda, he had before him the path that led to the
pier which projected about a hundred feet out into the lake. The more
than a mile of water was violently disturbed today, and across this
expanse of uneasy water the ground rose to where it rounded off as a
thickly brushed mountain.
   <p>Until a couple of hours before the judge had felt easier in mind
than he had felt for a long time. Since Bill had had his fight with
Goddard in Pinenut he had seemed to have  changed completely.
   <p>The judge could not think of Bill's defeat by Goddard as a thing
of much importance except that possibly defeat by a smaller, lighter
man had brought Bill back to his senses and made him see the futility
of the life he had been leading. He had almost entirely settled back
into his old ways, even to reading law about two hours each day.
Though he did not refuse wine, which the judge always had on the
table at dinner, he did not act as though he found it necessary except
in moderate compliance with his father's habit.
   <p>In one respect the judge was not at peace of mind, and probably
never would be. Though he never expected to attain the happiness he
yearned for in a daughter-in-law and grandchildren, he knew the big
house would never really be complete until Kate, as Bill's wife,
brought children to it. She would be here now, and probably with a
little one he might jounce on his knee, if it had not been for the
narrow-minded priggishness of Dan Hawley and his wife.
   <p><quote>From what I have heard,</quote> he mused with a sigh that had
considerable bitterness in it, <quote>they would have thought themselves
socially besmirched because of poor Bill's deluded mother. May God
have mercy on her soul! And may Lombard burn in hell! In his hands
she was as putty, and I myself am by no means blameless for not having
given more time and attention to her and less to the acquisition of
wealth, yes, and the establishment of a high reputation as an attorney
at law.</quote>
   <p>Now the judge was not thinking about what might have been but for
Dan Hawley and his wife. He was thinking, even worrying about his
son. Soon after ten o'clock, when the lake had been as smooth as blue
water could be, Bill had set off in his sixteen-foot yawl with Bueno
Buck, a strapping young Pomo Indian, to row for him. Bill had
intended to do some trolling for lake trout beyond the rounded
promontory around which the shore bent to make the mile-wide cove
before it straightened out toward The Narrows above which the main
body of the lake lay.
   <p>Now the judge was not worried about the permanence of the change
in his son. He was alarmed for Bill's safety. Rising two hours
earlier than was its habit, the northwest wind, prevalent at this
season, was marching high, white-capped waves down the lake, breaking
them into spray against the point and against the opposite shore, and
even sending spray so high it sometimes covered the pier.
   <p>Of course in such a gale Bill and Bueno Buck could tie up in the
far end of the mile-wide cove and wait for the wind to blow itself
out, which it would probably do along toward sunset. But would they
do it? Bill had said he would be back home not later than one
o'clock.
   <p>The judge had decided that Bill and the young Indian had accepted
the inevitable and sensibly decided to wait for the gale to blow
itself out when he caught and held his breath, then rose hastily.
Around that rounded rocky promontory where the white spray could be
seen flying across the distance of a mile and a half, came the yawl
under her full triangular sail, and to the judge's frightened eyes, so
close to the rocks that it would be dashed against them with the lift
of the next wave.
   <p><quote>That boy! That damned fool boy! What does he mean by trying
to come home now, even if he did promise? What does time mean when
weighed against the life of two human beings?</quote>
   <p>Not until he was certain that the yawl had rounded the rocky
point instead of being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them with part of that
howling northwest gale. But his fright and alarm were not gone, they
were merely lessened. He could see that a figure, undoubtedly that of
his beloved fool son, was now sitting in the stern sheets as the yawl
quartered out into the lake, and another figure close against the
weather gunwale was apparently bailing fast, with as near frenzy as a
young Indian who could swim like a fish could come to frenzy.
   <p>Not until he was certain the yawl had successfully got away from
the rocks did the judge begin to stride to and fro on his wide
veranda, and then not really realizing what he was doing. He was
almost like the captain of a rudderless ship pacing his own bridge.
What control had he over that tiny craft that was lifting to a wave
crest, then dropping from sight in a trough? When the wind was on a
rampage, as it was now, it could kick up a sea-sized commotion where
it had a straight blow of eight miles down the lake.
   <p><quote>Big blow, Judge,</quote> remarked Willie Kim as the wind
billowed out and sucked in his baggy black blouse and pantaloons.
<quote>Blow like hell. Maybe by and by she blow some more.</quote>
   <p><quote>Hello, Willie, where did you come from?</quote> the judge said in
mild surprise. <quote>I didn't hear you. Do you see that fool boy of mine
out there on the lake?</quote>
   <p><quote>I see him. You don't need worry, Judge. Big wind like that
can't drown good man. Bill is good man, and Bueno Buck is raised on
lake. He no drown, too. Him, his mother throw him into water to make
him swim when he is born. Maybe so Bill, he can swim that good,
too.</quote>
<head>CHAPTER 19</head>
   <p>THE yawl, riding the high waves with an air that might have
made an ocean liner envious, seemed prepared to make a safe though
violent landing when there came a sudden gust of wind from the west.
   <p><quote>My God!</quote> the judge cried out. <quote>The boy is going to try to
make a landing on the weather side of that pier! He'll wreck!</quote>
   <p>Willie Kim was speechless, only his slant black eyes showing any
emotion.
   <p>With a quick shift of tiller, and at the same time jibbing the
boom to which he had the stay rope fastened, Bill made the yawl
recover. It seemed to the frightened judge as though his son would
actually shoot the craft in under the outer end of the wharf. But by
pressing the tiller hard over and at the same time dropping the small
sheet of wet canvas, Bill cleared the corner of the pier by inches,
and with the tiller still hard over, brought the yawl up against the
waves with sufficient momentum to permit Bueno Buck, now on his feet
with a coiled rope in left hand a cowboy loop in right, to toss the
loop over one of the piles that projected upward for about three feet,
from the lee side of the pier.
   <p><quote>Willie,</quote> the judge said huskily, <quote>that was as pretty a piece
of seamanship as I ever saw. That boy of mine seems to know how to do
everything, when he wants to.</quote>
   <p><quote>Naw,</quote> disputed Willie. <quote>Just play in damn fine luck
this time. He plenty smart though.</quote>
   <p>As they reached the pier, the judge on legs that were a little
unsteady, they found Bueno Buck, now on the pier, leading the yawl
toward the wave-battered shore.
   <p><quote>Hello, Dad!</quote> Bill called. <quote>I hope you weren't worried.
We're going to drag the boat ashore and turn her over. She has a
foot of water in her. I wouldn't be surprised if we broke all speed
records on the way in. Yes sir, I am slightly wet, and Buck would be
wetter if he had more clothes on.</quote>
   <p>With four doing the job and the waves pushing at the stern, the
yawl was soon dragged out but before it was turned over Bueno Buck
reached into the foot of water, tossed out a string of silvery lake
trout and said &mdash;
   <p><quote>Bill, he's better man at catch 'em than Injun, Judge. You
look. Little one more as fifteen inches. Maybe big one four feet,
huh?</quote>
   <p><quote>By George, that is a beautiful string of fish!</quote> exclaimed the
judge. <quote>Toss them on the grass and then we'll all get hold and
heave.</quote>
   <p>A few moments later the yawl was upside down, exposing its
shallow keel.

<text id=LOBN04>
   <p>Bertram's face was grim. <quote>You think it was the Snort, don't
you?</quote>
   <p>John gave a short laugh. <quote>I did,</quote> he said; <quote>but I'd better
stop thinking that now. Pericles is fitted with an identically
similar one.</quote>
   <p>
   <p><quote>So there you are, my dear.</quote>
   <p>Peggy's eyes filled with tears. <quote>It's so unfair,</quote> she said.
<quote>That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six months ashore while
Pericles was refitting in the dockyard and now that she's ready
for sea he goes sick. Just because he's an Honourable he can do what
he likes. Anyway, why pick on you to succeed him?</quote>
   <p>John didn't answer. There was no point in sharing his discomfort
with Peggy. A submariner's wife needed to be spared as much as
possible. Anyway the Parsifal affair was far too fresh in both
their minds to be a comfortable subject for discussion. <quote>It's a
command,</quote> he said. <quote>We can do with the extra money. It'll just
about pay Jacky's school fees.</quote>
   <p><quote>What shall we do about this house? &mdash; and Jill's school? &mdash; and
oh! how I hate the Navy! If I'd known what it would be like I'd
sooner have married a parson.</quote>
   <p>He kissed her. <quote>Parsons work on Sundays,</quote> he said. <quote>They're
worse off than submariners. You ought to have married that fat
stockbroker chap and shared him with his three mistresses. Anyway it
might be much worse. Pericles is a Portsmouth boat. She spends
longer in harbour than any other submarine. Practically a shore job.
Cheer up.</quote>
   <p>She wiped her eyes and reached for her address book. <quote>I'll
write to those agents and try to get a flat in Alverstoke,</quote> she
said. <quote>But I don't know what Jill will say about leaving her school.
It's a blessing that Jacky's off to boarding school. And all the
trouble you've taken with the garden! That little beast, Robbie
Munyard!</quote>
   <p>Having said her say Peggy manfully shouldered her burden and
prepared to break up yet another home. In the ten years of married
life this had already happened half a dozen times. Such is the life
of a naval officer's wife.
   <p>
   <p>John's father had been a naval officer of the old school; some of
his rigid ideas had been passed on to the second generation. One of
these was that an officer should join a ship, on taking up a new
appointment, at nine a.m. precisely, dressed in the modern
equivalent of frock-coat and sword. It would have been acceptable to
all concerned if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
plain-clothes on the previous night, but ways instilled by martinet
parents have a habit of sticking. So he put up for the night at The
Admiral's Head, that famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in
historic interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German bombs
during the last war.
   <p>Having deposited his baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
went in search of a drink. The lower bar was empty, save for the lady
known by all habitu&eacute;s as <squote>Seaweed</squote>, and a youngish, sharp-eyed
man who was staring moodily into a gin and tonic.
   <p>Seaweed's memory was prodigious; her manner must have been worth
a great deal to the proprietors of the hotel. She greeted John,
however, with less than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
glance at him. Evidently the other occupant of the bar was not
persona grata. If her memory was good, so was this
stranger's.
   <p><quote>You're Commander Winter,</quote> he said. <quote>Have a gin?</quote> He
turned to Seaweed &mdash; <quote>Make it a large one, darling. I know the naval
habits. <squote>Drink gin and call each other wallahs, what!</squote> &mdash; as the
Guards officer said on his return from a visit to the Royal Navy.
Submarines, what. Youngest D.S.C. in the war, what? Crawled
inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry bomb. Should have been a
V.C. What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is
obviously thirsty.</quote>
   <p>John fought back his inherited desire to snub the man. If he did
he would have to leave the bar and either sit in the lounge or return
to his bedroom.
   <p>Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and came to the rescue.
   <p><quote>You haven't introduced yourself,</quote> she said with mock
severity. <quote>It's a rule on these premises. No treating with
strangers &mdash; that's right, John, isn't it?</quote>
   <p><quote>My fault entirely,</quote> said the stranger. <quote>It's my conceited
nature &mdash; I assumed that you both knew who I was. I'm Ian Bawley.
Does that mean anything to you?</quote>
   <p>It did. Ian Bawley's name was printed at the head of most naval
articles in the Daily Courier.
   <p><quote>Oh, the Press,</quote> said Seaweed. <quote>Down here on business,
Mr. Bawley?</quote>
   <p><quote>A pressman is always on the job.</quote> He held out his hand and
John could not do otherwise than take it. <quote>Pleased to meet you,
Commander,</quote> he said. <quote>Now what about that drink?</quote>
   <p>John nodded &mdash; he could afford to buy one in return and he was
lonely.
   <p><quote>For the sake of accuracy,</quote> he said, <quote>and I know how you
newspaper people value that commodity! &mdash; please don't address me as
Commander. I'm a Lieutenant-Commander. Perhaps we could drop the
rank &mdash; such a mouthful!</quote>
   <p><quote>You're absolutely right,</quote> said Bawley, as he pushed over his
glass. <quote>Fill it up, darling. Accuracy above all else. We pride
ourselves about accuracy on the Courier. Ever known us bowl a
wide about your Service? Check and counter-check &mdash; nothing but the
truth. Somewhat embarrassing, what?</quote>
   <p><quote>How can the truth be embarrassing?</quote> John sipped his double
gin with relish. It was his favourite brand, he was on the verge of a
new chapter in his career, and his companion's attitude was
challenging. Life at home and in Bath had been a trifle too
comfortable and humdrum. He'd never before met a pressman and found
him curiously stimulating.
   <p><quote>You're a bit of a humorist, aren't you?</quote> said Bawley. <quote>The
truth is usually very embarrassing. You're in submarines, aren't
you?</quote>
   <p><quote>You know a great deal about me,</quote> said John.
   <p><quote>It's my business. I'll tell you more. You're going to take
over command of Pericles. Am I right?</quote>
   <p><quote>Who told you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Little bird. Other half?</quote>
   <p>John nodded. <quote>On me.</quote>
   <p>Bawley shook his head. <quote>All paid for by His Lordship,</quote> he
said. <quote>Expense account. You're a married man with a couple of kids.
Can't go wasting your substance on a complete stranger. Set 'em up,
darling!</quote>
   <p>John flushed. <quote>I'm not in need of charity.</quote>
   <p><quote>Come off it,</quote> said Bawley. <quote>The proprietor of the Daily
Courier knows what's going on. If he doesn't mind, why should
you?</quote>
   <p><quote>I see.</quote> John took the refilled glass and looked over the rim
at his companion. <quote>You want me to talk, is that it?</quote>
   <p><quote>You misjudge me,</quote> said Bawley. <quote>You have nothing to tell
me, yet. But we'll be meeting again, no doubt, and then you will
have. Regard this as a softening-up process, and have dinner with me?
On His Lordship, of course.</quote>
   <p><quote>On one condition,</quote> said John. <quote>Tell me who the little bird
was.</quote>
   <p><quote>Can't you guess? Whose portrait appears regularly in the shiny
papers?</quote>
   <p><quote>You mean Munyard?</quote>
   <p><quote>Sure. Very useful contact, is our Robbie; he gives us the gen
and we give him the publicity. <squote>The Honourable <quote>Robbie</quote> and
friend</squote>, what? You know the sort of thing.</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll get nothing out of me,</quote> said John, <quote>but you can pay
for my drinks if you want to, as long as you keep off Service
matters.</quote>
   <p><quote>Good-oh! One for the grill-room, darling, and tell George to
bring in the carte du jour.</quote>
   <p>Bawley was a man of his word. He kept away from Service matters,
was an excellent host and a splendid raconteur. The evening passed
all too quickly. As they parted in the vestibule the two men were
well disposed towards each other.
   <p><quote>Ever been to Fleet Street?</quote> asked Bawley. <quote>You should.
Next time you're in Town give me a ring at this number and I'll take
you round the pubs where most of the work is done.</quote> He held out a
card. John took it and put it in his pocket.
   <p><quote>Thanks,</quote> he said. <quote>If ever my missus lets me off the chain
I'll take you up on that. Ever been out in a submarine? I'll give
you a spin round one of these days, if you like. You could write it
up.</quote>
   <p>Bawley made a face. <quote>Not in Pericles, old man.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why not?</quote>
   <p><quote>Better ask Robbie Munyard.</quote>
   <p><quote>What's he been saying?</quote> John was furious. The little
squirt! To go gassing to a newspaper man!
   <p><quote>Look!</quote> he went on earnestly. <quote>You're not going to write up
Pericles in some way or other, are you?</quote>
   <p><quote>What is there to write up?</quote> said Bawley. <quote>There are
forty-three submarines in the Navy &mdash; why should I pick on
Pericles?</quote>
   <p>John eyed him steadily.
   <p><quote>It's the Parcifal business, isn't it?</quote> he said quietly.
   <p><quote>I don't want it to happen again,</quote> said Bawley &mdash; <quote>more so
than ever since I met you.</quote>
   <p><quote>What did Munyard say?</quote>
   <p><quote>The Snort &mdash; hull fitting fractured.</quote>
   <p><quote>Supposing I was to tell you that we've had Pericles' entire
Snort equipment removed and X-rayed and that it was as sound as a
bell?</quote> said John.
   <p><quote>Munyard didn't tell me that. But I must confess I'm relieved.
But it still doesn't do away with the possibility of faulty
design.</quote>
   <p>He held out his hand.
   <p><quote>Maybe I will take a trip with you one of these days,</quote> he
said. <quote>In the meantime I'll tell my editor that the story's a dead
bird. Glad I met you. Don't forget to give me a ring &mdash; any time &mdash;
knock twice and ask for Bawley, what?</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't know when that will be,</quote> said John. <quote>I shall be
busy for a while, cleaning up after Master bloody Munyard.</quote>
<head>2</head>
<head>CAPTAIN HENRY TURTON, D.S.O., R.N.</head>
   <p>THERE were six submarines, lying in pairs alongside the
jetty at Fort Blockhouse. Black and grimly businesslike they both
looked and sounded, for all of them were rumbling as they charged
their electric batteries. A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel
exhaust in through the open windows of the Captain's house. It
pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine Turton noticed its
existence as they sat in silence over a substantial breakfast.
Although usually a very talkative lady Madeleine respected her
husband's silences, for she knew they betokened a worry of some sort.
There had been many such breakfasts lately since the affair of
Parsifal. Harry had lost a good deal of weight. His normal
placid and steady-going manner remained, but she could see that it no
longer came naturally. It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior
Officers to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine,
though in peace time these happenings are few and far between. This
is the testing time for all. The affair blows up into a national
disaster and then when it is all over life must continue as before.
During this period the Captain must present an unruffled appearance
and carry on as if nothing unusual has happened. Harry Turton had
written letters to the bereaved, had visited many in the locality, had
been interviewed by the Press, had driven his surviving submarines a
good deal harder than usual and in fact had applied all the usual
specifics suitable for such occasions. The worst was over now, except
for the Pericles affair.
   <p>It had never occurred to Harry Turton that Robbie Munyard,
popular as he was, especially with the ladies, son of a famous man and
an (apparently) well weathered submariner, should go to pieces as he
had done with disastrous effects on the morale of his crew; but he
had. Quite suddenly he'd walked into the office and declared that his
command was not fit to go under water and then he had burst into
tears. Now he was at the naval hospital. Acute neurasthenia, said
the Surgeon-Rear-Admiral. The affair had been handled quietly and
efficiently but rumours of this extraordinary scene in the office had
reached to the far corners of the establishment. Munyard had left his
jitters behind. Long conferences had been held between Harry Turton
and his Admiral in which various alterations had been debated.

<text id=LOBN05>
Fred was eyeing Hanson with a little tingle passing up and down his
spine. This police inspector looked genuine enough, but Freeman was
taking no chances. The fact that the inspector was a total stranger
increased his suspicions. Fred was well acquainted with most of the
police officers who operated in this district....
   <p><quote>Sorry, sir,</quote> he said blandly. <quote>I'd better tell you the
truth, I think. No need for you to waste your time. Mr. Conquest
went out some time ago.</quote>
   <p>Hanson's lips tightened. He believed this to be a lie. Landis
had been watching, and he was convinced that the Conquests had not
left &mdash; and Landis was a man who had been well trained for work of this
kind.
   <p><quote>So Mr. Conquest went out?</quote> said Hanson, with ominous calm.
<quote>I'd advise you not to lie to me, my man. If Conquest gave you
orders to say that he was out...</quote>
   <p><quote>No, sir. He went out. I saw him go.</quote>
   <p><quote>When did he go? And where?</quote>
   <p><quote>Didn't say where, sir &mdash; never does say.</quote>
   <p><quote>When do you expect him back?</quote>
   <p><quote>Never expect him back, sir,</quote> said Fred, in the same bland
voice. <quote>He's a very uncertain young gentleman, is Mr. Conquest.
Might be hours. Might be days.</quote>
   <p><quote>Was he alone?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, sir. His wife was with him.</quote>
   <p>Hanson was now certain that Freeman was lying. Landis could not
possibly have missed seeing the small, attractive figure of Joy.
Hanson was rapidly becoming exasperated, and he showed it in his
manner.
   <p><quote>Who else is in the flat?</quote> he snapped.
   <p><quote>Nobody, sir.</quote>
   <p><quote>No servants?</quote>
   <p><quote>There's Miss Bliss, the housekeeper, but she left an hour ago.
And there's Livingstone, who looks after Mr. Conquest's car, and
does odd jobs. He went out, too. The flat's empty.</quote>
   <p>Hanson swore.
   <p><quote>Listen to me, my man,</quote> he said grimly, as he laid a hard hand
on Fred's arm. <quote>We in the police are well aware of Conquest and his
tricky ways. He may live like a gentleman in an expensive penthouse,
but he's worse than half the crooks in London. You're lying to me &mdash;
on his orders. Take me up to the penthouse at once.</quote>
   <p><quote>What's the use?</quote> asked Freeman. <quote>It's empty.</quote>
   <p>He was inwardly excited. He believed this police inspector to be
a phony, and he had to decide what to do on the spur of the moment.
It was the first time he had ever been required to take a really
active part in one of his employer's enterprises, and he was thrilled.
   <p><quote>That's enough,</quote> said Hanson curtly. <quote>Take me up
immediately.</quote>
   <p><quote>All right, sir.</quote>
   <p>Freeman led the way to the private lift, and a minute later they
were ascending. At the top, as soon as the door slid open, Hanson
stepped out, and was annoyed to find Freeman following him. The
lounge was empty.
   <p><quote>All right &mdash; you can take the lift down,</quote> said Hanson curtly
<quote>I shan't need you now.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, sir,</quote> said Fred stubbornly. <quote>I've had the guv'nor's
orders not to let anybody into the flat, and if you wasn't a policeman
I wouldn't have let you in. I'm staying until you've finished.</quote>
   <p>Hanson had not expected this difficulty. Even in his role of a
police inspector there was a limit to the amount of ordering he could
do. It would be dangerous to arouse this porter's suspicions. Also,
the lounge was very empty, and the entire penthouse was silent, with
no sign of life.
   <p><quote>Mr. Conquest!</quote> shouted Hanson loudly.
   <p>Silence &mdash; except for a discreet cough from Fred.
   <p><quote>I told you there wasn't anybody home,</quote> he said. <quote>No good
you shouting, sir.</quote>
   <p><quote>Stay where you are,</quote> snapped Hanson.
   <p>He was not only puzzled, but alarmed. The Conquests were here &mdash;
they must be here. If they had left, Landis would have seen them.
Hanson suspected a trick. With a hand in the pocket of his uniform
jacket &mdash; where he carried the gun &mdash; he made for the nearest door. It
led through into the kitchen quarters. Everything tidy and neat, but
no living thing present. Hanson quickly explored Aunt Susan's
bedroom, which was also in this part of the penthouse.
   <p>Baffled, he returned to the lounge. An examination of the
bedrooms and bathroom led to the same result. Empty. He passed
through the passage, watched amusedly by Fred, into the garage. No
sign of life here, either. The shiny Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s was there, its
windows shattered as of the previous night.
   <p><quote>Hell!</quote> muttered Hanson under his breath.
   <p>He inwardly cursed Landis. The man had obviously fallen down on
his job. In some way, every occupant of the penthouse had left the
premises &mdash; and Landis had not seen them go. It was understandable
that Aunt Susan and Livingstone had escaped the watcher's attention;
but it was incredible that he could have missed such striking figures
as those of Norman and Joy. How the devil had he been tricked?
   <p><quote>Well, sir?</quote> asked Freeman patiently, as Hanson re-entered the
lounge.
   <p><quote>You appear to have been right,</quote> admitted Hanson savagely.
<quote>There's nobody here. Take me down.</quote>
   <p>He made a move towards the lift, and then halted. He had caught
sight of a card prominently displayed on the cocktail bar. He strode
across, and examined it &mdash; and a fluttery sensation assailed his
stomach. The card simply said &mdash; <quote>Back on April the nineteenth.</quote>
   <p>The implication was obvious. The world, in Conquest's opinion,
would still be functioning after the expiration of the True Prophet's
deadline. Hanson inwardly squirmed. This young hell-hound was
prepared for everything! He had even suspected that the opposition
would invade the penthouse, and he had left this card for their
benefit!
   <p>Hanson's very appearance &mdash; his hard breathing, his frustration,
his savage expression &mdash; assured Fred Freeman that he was a fake. No
genuine police inspector would have reacted in this way. And Fred was
agog with excitement because he had suddenly decided to make a move
which might, or might not, meet with Conquest's approval. He was
going to act on his own initiative, and his heart began to pump.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry, sir,</quote> he said, striving to keep his voice normal,
<quote>but there's one room you haven't seen. At least, I don't think
you've seen it. I meant to tell you about it. It's a sort of private
room. Mr. Conquest might be there.</quote>
   <p>Hanson swung round, staring.
   <p><quote>A private room?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, sir. You wouldn't have seen it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Take me to it.</quote>
   <p>Hanson had no suspicion that this ordinary-looking porter was
adopting something of his employer's technique. He was not surprised,
however, to hear that the flat contained a <quote>private room.</quote> Fedder
had told him a great deal about the trickiness of the young man who
signed himself <quote>1066.</quote> It was unfortunate, however, that Fedder
had not mentioned the <quote>private room</quote> &mdash; which Fedder himself had
occupied, to his mortification, at the time when Conquest had been
getting to grips with Pierre Dacca, the Paris criminal.
   <p><quote>This way, sir.</quote>
   <p>Fred was quivering with eagerness. He led the way into the
laboratory, which Hanson had already examined. A plain, austere
apartment, gleaming with porcelain-tiled walls and glass shelves.
Fred went straight across to the plain wall opposite the door.
   <p><quote>It's here, sir,</quote> he said, grinning.
   <p><quote>What are you trying to do &mdash; make a fool of me?</quote> shouted
Hanson. <quote>There's no doorway in that wall.</quote>
   <p>Fred reached up, but Hanson did not see what his hand was doing;
all he knew was that a portion of the wall silently opened, revealing
a void. Lights sprang on, and Hanson found himself staring into a
comfortable little inner room, where there was a lounge and other
articles of furniture. He took rapid steps to the doorway, and peered
in.
   <p>A fatal move....
   <p>For Hanson had placed himself exactly where Fred Freeman required
him. A quick shove, and Hanson blundered headlong into the inner
room. Before he could recover his balance, the wall had closed upon
him. Fred, on his side, breathed heavily.
   <p><quote>Blimey, I hope I've done right!</quote> he muttered, thoroughly
scared now that the thing had been accomplished.
   <p>Months ago, Conquest had shown Freeman the secret of the inner
room, saying that it might be useful, one day, for Fred to know about
it. For Conquest trusted the man implicitly, and with good reason.
Fred was as loyal as Livingstone himself. But this was the first
time he had ever actively assisted Norman, and the occasion rather
overawed him. He remembered something else. He again turned to the
blank wall, and this time a little cubby-hole opened, not far from the
door &mdash; much too small to admit the exit of a human body. He bent
down, and saw Hanson's face staring at him.
   <p><quote>How do you like it, mister?</quote> asked Fred recklessly. <quote>You a
police inspector? A cop? Like my foot! When do you think I was
born &mdash; yesterday?</quote>
   <p><quote>My God!</quote> panted Hanson, his brain nearly bursting.
   <p>He had been alarmed to find himself trapped, but to see the
gloating face of his trapper peering at him through this hole was more
than his nerve could stand.
   <p><quote>Conquest put you up to this!</quote> he snarled. <quote>Let me out of
here!</quote> He pulled the gun out of his pocket and thrust it forward,
thus certifying himself as a fake &mdash; for no genuine police inspector
carries a gun. <quote>Put your hands up!</quote>
   <p>Fred laughed. The threat was so idle that he could afford to
laugh. All the same, he lost no time in sliding along the wall, out
of range. There was still the danger that the trapped man would reach
as far as possible through the opening, and use the gun, but Fred
scotched this by operating the mechanism again, and causing the
opening to close itself up. Not that he need have worried; for Hanson
was no gunman, and in the excitement of the moment he had forgotten to
release the safety-catch of the automatic.
   <p><quote>I was right,</quote> whispered Fred to himself, with jubilation.
<quote>He's a phony.</quote>
   <p>The word put an idea into his head, and he hurried through to the
lounge and went to the phone. He dialled a Streatham number, and in a
few moments was gratified to hear Conquest's clear voice.
   <p><quote>It's me, sir &mdash; Fred,</quote> panted the porter. <quote>Something's
happened, sir. I don't know whether I've done right, but I hope I
have.</quote>
   <p><quote>You sound hoarse, Fred. Calm down, and tell me exactly what
happened,</quote> came Conquest's voice. <quote>Spare no details, however
slight, for I suspect that your singular narrative will be fraught
with interest.</quote>
   <p><quote>Come off it, Mr. Conquest,</quote> protested Fred. <quote>This is
serious. I've got a man locked up in your secret room....</quote>
   <p>He went into details, describing exactly what had happened....
   <p><quote>Did I do right, sir?</quote> he ended anxiously.
   <p><quote>The word <squote>right</squote> is totally inadequate, Fred,</quote> replied
Norman, with a chuckle in his voice. <quote>Well done! As nice a piece of
work as I can remember. I thought there might be some kind of enemy
activity, although I hardly expected it to explode so soon. This
blighter has a gun, eh? You'd better warn Bill Williams about
that.</quote>
   <p><quote>Mr. Williams, sir?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. As soon as we've hung up, get through to Scotland Yard,
ask for the superintendent, and tell him what you've got. He'll be
charmed. Another of the ungodly for Bill's collection. We're not
doing so badly, Fred. This bloke of yours seems to be one of the more
important specimens.</quote>
   <p>The porter, who had not the faintest idea of the game which
Conquest was playing, asked no questions. He was satisfied with
Norman's words of praise, and he lost no time in getting in touch with
Scotland Yard....
   <p>At Hampstead, Fedder was impatiently awaiting Hanson's return.
He was not too satisfied with Hanson. More than once, since they had
parted, he had felt that he should have sent a more determined, more
ruthless man on this particular assignment. Too late now, of course.
All he could do was wait.
   <p>The truth was, Fedder had been pitchforked into near-panic action
by the fear that Conquest, if any delay took place, would elude him.

<text id=LOBN06>
   <p>There were tears in her eyes then and it was a mighty big
temptation to back down and tell her to stay which would be just what
I would want in my goddam selfish way. So instead I hardened my
heart, and it was real hard work. Even Matt Tompkins gave me a dirty
look. I expect he figured I was a real mean hombre.
   <p><quote>I'll be here to see you onto the stage tomorrow morning,</quote> I
said. <quote>Meantime I should stay indoors. This town is no health
resort.</quote>
   <p><quote>Amen to that,</quote> said Ma Tompkins unexpectedly.
   <p><quote>It's a sink of iniquity, a real Sodom and Gomorrow.</quote>
   <p><quote>Gomorrah,</quote> I said absent-minded like. My Pa never made any
mistake over words from the good book. <quote>So-long then till tomorrow,
Miss Jeannie, and look after yourself.</quote>
   <p>And with those weak words I walked on out, avoiding Jeannie
Bain's accusing eyes and wishing I had the strength to say a half of
all the things I'd have liked to say to her.
   <p>I stood around in the early morning sunlight not knowing quite
what to do next and then of course I remembered that I had better go
find Dan Maffrey and get him wised up about last night's occurrences.
I ambled on from Ma Tompkins's house to the livery stable. The owner
was inside rubbing down a horse. I stood around watching him and
listening to him hiss through his teeth in the peculiar way hostlers
have.
   <p><quote>That's a fine horse you've got there, mister,</quote> I said at
last.
   <p>He broke off his hissing for a brief space and took a quick look
at me.
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> he said. <quote>It's a Morgan. Belongs to the Town
Marshal.</quote>
   <p>Something in his eyes as he said this, a swift flicker of double
knowledge, made me think. Here was someone who'd known all about Bill
Appleton and someone who'd had enough time to let Pell and his gang
know about Appleton's movements and identity too. Someone maybe who'd
been at the meeting. This man had been at the meeting too.
   <p><quote>You heard what happened to Appleton after the meeting?</quote> I
said.
   <p><quote>Yeah,</quote> he said. <quote>I heard.</quote>
   <p><quote>Someone must have arranged that,</quote> I went on.
   <p><quote>Mebbe so. I jest hear things. Everyone talks to
liverymen.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> I said. <quote>There's too much pow-wowing going on
hereabouts.</quote>
   <p>He came out from behind the Marshal's horse.
   <p><quote>You want your pony, mister?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> I said, <quote>I'll take a little pasear around. Maybe I'll
hear a little more talk along the trail and maybe I'll find out who
killed Bill Appleton.</quote>
   <p>He went off then to get Bessie from an inner stall. She came
along and whickered when she saw me. The liveryman pulled my rig off
a nail and slapped it on the mare.
   <p><quote>You coming back?</quote> he said when he'd got the saddle fixed.
   <p><quote>I aim to,</quote> I said, cold as a fish. <quote>This town kind of grows
on me.</quote>
   <p>I climbed up onto Bessie and he watched me with resentment, fear
and self-disgust fighting for possession of his face. I rode out and
away from town at a quiet trot. I would circle around and try to find
Dan Maffrey on the other side in the hidey-hole he'd ridden off to
last night.
   <p>It took me an hour to make my circle of the town. I found the
trail along which Dan must have come in. It was well-worn,
wheel-marked and dusty. It would be the trail up to Colorado, I
figured. About four miles along, it swung north-east, twisting and
turning through rough country with big rocks sticking out all round.
A coach, I thought, would have to slow up some on a trail like that.
I trotted on. The perfect spot lay about half a mile further on, on
an upgrade that was steep enough to slow any coach to a crawl. I
reined in and took a look around. There were medium-sized rocks and
mesquite bushes on both sides at the top, with enough cover for men
and horses until the right moment. Further over, about four hundred
yards west of the trail, the ground rose again to a ridge. I was
staring at it when I heard a voice.
   <p><quote>You got the same idea as me.</quote> It was Dan of course, bellied
down on the far side. I saw him stand up and then he disappeared for
a moment, reappearing seconds later on his cayuse. He rode down to
where I was waiting. I was thinking what a skill he had for reading
my mind.
   <p><quote>This would be as good a place for a hold-up as any,</quote> he said,
reining in near me.
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> I said. <quote>It'll be here tomorrow as likely as not.</quote>
I paused. <quote>Miss Jeannie'll be on that coach, Dan.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> he said. <quote>I know.</quote>
   <p><quote>No harm must come to her, Dan.</quote>
   <p><quote>She'll be all right. It's the men who'll be after that coach
I'm interested in, Johnny.</quote>
   <p><quote>I know. But if lead starts flying she might be in danger.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's so. But I reckon they'll be too busy shooting at us to
bother with the coach and the folks in it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Maybe,</quote> I said. <quote>But we've got to remember that girl all
the time, Dan. I feel kind of responsible for her.</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course,</quote> he said, giving me one of his strange looks.
Then he turned the conversation. <quote>Let's ride over and have a look
at the mining camp. After all it's them we're supposed to be working
for, as well as the townsfolk and the agency detective.</quote>
   <p>With something of a start I remembered the man who'd brought us
into this business.
   <p><quote>Maybe you don't know about Appleton, Dan?</quote>
   <p><quote>Know what?</quote>
   <p><quote>That he's dead,</quote> I said. I watched him because I was always
fascinated by the way he looked when you tried to surprise him.
   <p><quote>Dead?</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>Yes. Dead. Shuffled out of the deck. Blasted down with a
shotgun outside the Palace last night.</quote>
   <p><quote>Fenton or Somers,</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>Or the Town Marshal,</quote> I added.
   <p>His face was fixed, unreadable as a rock.
   <p><quote>Let's get over to the mining camp,</quote> he said abruptly.
   <p>He wheeled his horse back off the trail and up the slope leading
to the ridge. I followed. From the top you could see something of
the wild hill country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing. The air
was fresh and clear and you could see far over west and north for many
miles. The real high country of the Rockies lifted up in the distance
like a pale water-colour drawing. Between us and that lay a vast
stretch of hills, canyons, buttes and malpais.
   <p><quote>The mine-workings lie north of the town,</quote> said Dan. <quote>If we
head west we ought to cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the
north.</quote>
   <p>So we swung west, making slow going over rough country, sliding
on shale, climbing down into draws, circling a big mesa by a four or
five mile valley, sandy-floored. It got hotter as the day wore on and
we rested gratefully by a small creek where we watered the horses and
drank enough to cure our thirst. An hour's riding brought us to a
trail that we figured would lead to the miners' camp. We turned north
into it and after about four miles it led into a small canyon which
opened out into a wide shallow draw. Here in a dried-up creek-bed we
found the miners at work. They were scattered over a fairly wide area
working singly or in pairs.
   <p>We didn't approach unchallenged. Just short of the diggings
there was a roughly-built shack and as we got near someone inside
bawled out,
   <p><quote>If you come any closer, I'll sure blow your whiskers off.</quote>
   <p><quote>Take it easy, mister,</quote> I sang out. <quote>We don't aim to come
any closer and we've got no whiskers so as you can see. Just you go
and tell Nick Dowd we've come to talk to him about what happened last
night.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh,</quote> said the unseen guard. He blew a whistle then, loud and
shrill. The gun barrel peeking out through a hole in the shack never
wavered.
   <p>We sat our horses, waiting.
   <p><quote>Looks as though they're expecting trouble,</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>Where there's gold and women there's always trouble,</quote>
observed Dan, shifting about in his saddle. He was never long on
patience.
   <p>I saw several men running down towards the shack. They were all
armed with rifles. As the nearest of them came round the shack, his
rifle at the ready, I saw it was Nick Dowd, still wearing his blue
check shirt. He came up close, eyeing us suspiciously.
   <p><quote>We've come a-calling,</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>Can't see no reason for calling,</quote> he said. <quote>Still long as
you're here you may as well stay a while. 'Light an' come on in.</quote>
   <p>We dismounted and one of the miners who'd come along with Nick
Dowd took our horses off to water. We followed Nick Dowd into the
shack. They'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it a huge blackened
coffee-pot steamed. Other miners followed in at our heels. Nick Dowd
found us a couple of boxes to sit on. A small man in bib overalls and
a battered Derby hat fussed around the stove.
   <p><quote>Ain't exactly the Ritz Hotel but we've got our little
comforts,</quote> said Dowd. He introduced the men who'd come in as Roper
Smith, Shorty, Mick Golightly, Swede and the Sodbuster. This last was
the little hombre in big overalls. Very soon he had tin mugs filled
with hot black coffee sweetened with molasses for all and for us there
were two plates of beans.
   <p><quote>They gives you the wind,</quote> said the Sodbuster handing them to
us, <quote>but it's all we got as of now, apart from a few sacks of gold
dust.</quote> He winked at his partners. They all watched us as we ate
the beans. Then when we'd finished and I'd rolled a cigarette the man
called Shorty said, <quote>You were saying when you came in that somep'n
happened last night.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> I said. <quote>Something happened all right. After you'd
left the meeting, mister</quote> &mdash; I looked across at Nick Dowd &mdash; <quote>someone
cut down William Appleton outside the Palace with a shotgun.</quote>
   <p>I paused and watched my words affect them in their different
ways.
   <p><quote>That's sure bad news,</quote> said Dowd, sombrely.
   <p><quote>It jest about leaves everything wide open for Mr. Pell and
his bunch,</quote> observed Shorty. The rest of the men there said nothing
but you could see they were hard hit. They were simple men who knew a
lot maybe about digging for gold but were babes in arms when it came
to dealing with owlhooters and desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and
the rest.
   <p><quote>I guess we'd better hold onto the gold right hyar, Nick,</quote>
said the Sodbuster.
   <p><quote>Yeah,</quote> said Dowd dubiously. <quote>Mebbe we'd better.</quote>
   <p>Suprisingly Dan Maffrey came in at that point.
   <p><quote>If you do,</quote> he said, <quote>you'll be sure asking for trouble.
They'll be on your necks before you can say <squote>knife</squote>. It wouldn't
be the first time they've held up a diggings at gun point either.
They've done it before and got away with it.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're durned tootin', mister,</quote> said the man called Roper
Smith. <quote>We've got five rifles among us and a few six-shooters. But
most of us ain't eddicated in shootin'. It'd be a massacree,
yessir.</quote>
   <p><quote>If you'll take a chance on getting your gold to the bank, then
we'll abide by what we said at the meeting,</quote> said Dan. <quote>We'll
watch the stage out of reach.</quote>
   <p>I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in with Dan Maffrey's
aim to avenge himself on the Fenton bunch but still it was a handsome
offer so I chimed in too.
   <p><quote>That goes for me, gentlemen,</quote> I said. <quote>If they do try and
hold up the stage, it'll be a couple or three of them, no more. I
reckon we can deal with them all right.</quote>
   <p><quote>All right,</quote> said Dowd. <quote>We'll leave it as we planned it
last night.

An Apache will give plenty silver for a magazine rifle. And

   <p><quote>Count me in. I'll keep an eye on Parkhurst &mdash; Slocum, if that's

   <p><quote>Like what?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well... Carlyle, for one. Just don't like him. Look, Pete.
Didn't it strike you funny, the way he clammed up on the shooting?</quote>
   <p>Shaking his head, Ahrens said, <quote>No, it didn't. I told you he
was a cold fish. Asked a few questions on the way back yesterday, but
nobody opened up. Didn't expect them to. Reckon we'll just have to
let the matter solve itself.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm not waiting.</quote>
   <p><quote>Now look, feller. It's none of your business.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm making it my business.</quote>
   <p><quote>What in blazes got you so &mdash;</quote> His eyes sparked with
understanding. <quote>Ahhhh! I see, I see!</quote> He slowly nodded his head,
smiling. <quote>I told you she was a beauty. I told you.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're crazy.</quote> Brock felt a sudden warmth prickle his face.
<quote>Go climb your horse. Don't know who you're talking about.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll bet you don't. Very well, Sure-shot. You're a big boy
now. Should be able to look after yourself without &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Brock waved the grinning Ahrens out of the shack. <quote>Go play with
your Indians, will you!</quote>
   <p><quote>That's just what I'm going to do. Came up this way to look for
Indian signs. Got patrols cutting the country. Our friend Carlyle
should be grateful since his wagons will soon be back with supplies.
Might be he'll need a little Cavalry protection.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're taking those dispatches seriously.</quote>
   <p><quote>Darn right I am. Anything about Indians I take seriously. And
they'd like to get their bloody hands on the beef and whisky and beer
and stuff he hauls back.</quote>
   <p><quote>He ships out unbroken ore and brings back supplies?</quote>
   <p><quote>Takes about a month. Due back in a few days. Goes south
someplace. Anyway, much as I hate to do him a turn, it's my duty to
keep an eye out for him.</quote>
   <p>The troopers had been joshing with a starry-eyed Tom&aacute;s. They
snapped to rigid silence as the Major approached and mounted his roan
gelding. The boy ran to the gate, scraped it open, and waved the
trotting detail on its way.
   <p><quote>Mister Brock,</quote> Tom&aacute;s asked, watching the riders through
the haze of kicked up dust, <quote>How long before I can be a soldier?</quote>
   <p>Brock rumpled the boy's hair. <quote>Don't be in a hurry. Enjoy what
you have around here while you can.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, I do, Mister Brock. I do a lot of things here that I like.
And I can ride the mules very well, too.</quote> Pondering, he tipped the
curly head to one side. <quote>That is, Juanito I ride well. The other
one, Diablo, does not like for me to get on the back.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then stay off.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh yes. But not Juanito. He is a good mule. Sometimes I ride
him almost as far as where the Sheriff lived. When I am a soldier, I
will ride and ride and &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Hold on, now. A soldier has to walk too. Walk far.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, I can walk far, Mister Brock. I can walk all the way to
the mine.</quote>
   <p><quote>You keep away from the mine. No place for boys to play.</quote>
   <p>The suggestion of a pout puckered the boy's face. <quote>You talk
like my mother talks.</quote>
   <p><quote>You listen to your mother.</quote>
   <p><quote>I have to.</quote>
   <p>Brock said, <quote>A soldier must learn to take orders, do as he is
told. Your mother is your commander &mdash; like the Major. See? When she
tells you not to go to the mine, that is an order.</quote>
   <p>The brown eyes rolled slowly upward, searching Brock's serious
gaze. Softly, the boy said, <quote>It is?</quote>
   <p><quote>It is. How about it? A good soldier, or a bad boy?</quote>
   <p>A tough decision to make. Half the fun of being a boy was in
doing the things you were forbidden to do. On the other hand, to be a
soldier...! The picture of snorting horses and blue uniforms and
sheathed sabres was too fresh in his mind.
   <p><quote>A soldier, Mister Brock.</quote>
   <p><quote>Promise? On the honour of a soldier?</quote>
   <p>The large eyes lit up. <quote>I can do that? I can promise &mdash; like a
soldier?</quote>
   <p><quote>You can.</quote>
   <p><quote>I do it, Mister Brock. I promise, like a soldier.</quote>
   <p><quote>No more going to the mine, then.</quote>
   <p><quote>No sir, Mister Brock. Soldier's promise.</quote>
<head>Chapter Eight</head>
   <p>It was late in the afternoon before Magdalena returned the
cleaned and mended clothes. Saddling Rusty as soon as he was dressed,
Brock cut eastward in search of the Stevens' place. As long as he
felt compelled to look into the shooting of the Sheriff, he might as
well visit the victim's late home. Maybe Stevens' niece could furnish
a clue, he told himself, as the proud chestnut stretched limber legs
across the rocky soil. His interest was purely in the shooting!
Nothing else!
   <p>Topping a slight rise, he looked down on a squat white-painted
frame cottage &mdash; a square box dumped in the middle of the drab desert
with a white slat fence girdling it in uneven lines. Two low stringy
shrubs afforded the only touch of green within sight.
   <p>A weathered unpainted stable stood about fifty feet behind the
cottage, and a man came out of it, carrying a shovel and bucket, and
walked unhurriedly around the side. A dull orange shirt hung loosely
over dust brown pants; a red band circling long black strands of hair
clearly identified him as an Indian.
   <p>Touching Rusty, Brock guided the horse down the slope to the
white picket gate, dismounting as the cottage door opened.
   <p>She stood framed in the doorway, a formal full-length portrait
with hands clasped before her, head high. The soft violet eyes &mdash;
well, they were neither soft nor violet at the moment.
   <p><quote>Just what do you want here, Mister Taylor?</quote> Whatever it was,
he was not being invited to find it.
   <p><quote>Why....</quote> He hesitated, hat in hand. <quote>Just dropped by to
say hello, Miss Stevens. We're neighbours, y'know.</quote>
   <p><quote>Mister Carlyle told me.</quote>
   <p>He had been certain the eyes were more violet than grey. Could
it have been the black dress of mourning that brought out such warm
lights last evening? Surely, the gown she now wore &mdash; corn-flower
blue, waist-tight with full skirt &mdash; should complement tender violet
tints instead of accentuating the cold impersonal grey stare that
challenged him.
   <p><quote>Just thought I'd say hello,</quote> he repeated awkwardly. <quote>See if
there's anything I can do to &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>I assure you, sir, there is nothing worth spying on!</quote>
   <p><quote>Spying?</quote>
   <p><quote>Mister Carlyle told me!</quote>
   <p><quote>Told you what, ma'am?</quote> He forced a smile on his lips, even
though it had left his voice.
   <p><quote>Of your &mdash; profession! I was compelled to tolerate Yankee
subjugation back home, sir. I hoped to be free of it out here. At
least I could evade them when I saw blue uniforms.</quote>
   <p><quote>Sorry you feel that way, ma'am. But I don't see what that has
to do with calling me a spy.</quote>
   <p><quote>Please don't try to brazen it out, Mister Taylor &mdash; if that is
your name! Your companions have the questionable decency to show
their colours, but you...</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes...? But me?</quote>
   <p>She leaned forward, small fists clenched white at her sides.
Sparking each word with bitter contempt, she accused him with shaking
vehemence. <quote>You pose as something you never were! Trying to win
your way into Mister Carlyle's confidence, just to spy on him for your
Yankee masters!</quote>
   <p><quote>Now just a minute, young lady!</quote> His face reddened, darkening
the welts and bruises, and emphasizing the purple bulge under the
right eye. <quote>I don't like being called a spy!</quote>
   <p><quote>Call it what you will! There's a nastier term for it!</quote> She
stepped back, slamming the door shut, leaving him fuming as he gripped
the white picket fence.
   <p>Mister Carlyle told me!
   <p>Oh, he did, did he! Jamming the hat on his head, Brock leaped
to Rusty's back, swung him towards the mine. He'd look there first
and find out just what in the blazing hell Mister Carlyle had told
her!
   <p>
   <p>A thin freckled-faced youth sauntered from around the far side of
the loading platform as Brock drew Rusty to a rearing halt at the
mine. The boy's black hat sat far back on his head; his thumbs were
hooked in a wide cartridge belt. The hog leg butt of a long pistol
stuck out from a holster that was tied to his skinny thigh.
   <p><quote>Mister Carlyle around?</quote> Brock asked.
   <p><quote>What you want 'im fer?</quote> The boy tried to make the
age-changing voice sound hard, and it might have sounded ludicrous had
it not been for the reckless chill shimmering in cat-yellow eyes.
   <p><quote>Want to see him,</quote> Brock said. <quote>Know where he is?</quote>
   <p><quote>Maybe. Who are you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Neighbour. Is Carlyle here?</quote>
   <p>The boy spat between his teeth &mdash; just like O'Shay &mdash; and pressed
his thumbs down on the pistol belt &mdash; just like Clanton. He tried to
squint his eyes like Beeman when he said, <quote>Don't see 'im, do
yuh?</quote>
   <p>Brock looked the boy over from shabby boots to over-sized hat.
<quote>What are you trying to do, sonny? Play like you're a man?</quote>
   <p>A freckled hand flashed to the hog leg butt. The gawky frame
tensed.
   <p>Brock said, <quote>Better be careful who you play with, sonny.</quote> He
swung Rusty around and toed him into a run without seeing the
black-haired man waiting motionlessly behind the opposite side of the
platform.
   <p>Gimpy Beckett limped up to the youth as Brock disappeared down
the grade. <quote>See him before?</quote> he growled.
   <p>The boy shook his head. <quote>I shoulda give it to him!</quote>
   <p>Gimpy glared at the boy. <quote>Listen, Kid. Just 'cause you shot
one man, don't feel like you can shoot 'em all!</quote>
   <p><quote>You don't need to tell me.</quote>
   <p><quote>I am tellin' you! Get snotty with me, youngster, and I'll
take back that hog leg and warm your skinny butts with it. Carlyle
told me to learn you, and by God I will!</quote> He turned away and limped
to the shade of the mine office.
   <p>
   <p>Arkie was standing next to the saloon's hitching rail, minding
the red-wheeled chaise, when Brock rode up. The black stallion reared
in the shafts as Rusty drew close, and Arkie had to hang on with both
hands.
   <p><quote>Heck all!</quote> Arkie scolded Brock over his shoulder, <quote>You
know better'n to bring a horse that close to Jet! Mister Carlyle
sure give it to yuh, he finds out!</quote>
   <p>From the saddle, Brock said, <quote>You just tell me where Carlyle is
and I'll see that he finds out.</quote>
   <p>Arkie gaped up at him. <quote>You talkin' 'bout Mister
Carlyle?</quote>
   <p><quote>Where is he?</quote> Brock nodded towards the saloon. <quote>In
there?</quote>
   <p>Stunned, Arkie gasped, <quote>You mean you gonna tell Mister
Carlyle?</quote>
   <p>Dismounting, Brock slip-knotted the reins around the end post of
the hitch rail. <quote>Keep that black devil away from Rusty or you'll
have a sick horse on your hands,</quote> he warned, and leaped to the
wooden sidewalk.
   <p>About to push open the swinging doors, he stopped as a woman
touched his arm. A gaunt little creature, her pinched face seemed
more eyes than anything else. A faded blue sun-bonnet hid most of the
face and all of her hair, and she clutched a thin grey shawl as though
the sun's rays were streaks of penetrating sleet. Her long full
skirt, a worn drab plaid, swept the boardwalk in uneven folds. <quote>I
must see you, Mister Taylor,</quote> she whispered, leaning close. <quote>Just
for a minute. Please.</quote>
   <p>Brock glanced impatiently inside the saloon. <quote>Yes, ma'am?</quote>
   <p><quote>Over here.</quote> She led him to the second building past the
saloon.
   <p><quote>Look, ma'am.</quote> He tried to sound patient. <quote>I have business
to attend to. I'll be glad to listen if &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>You don't remember me Mister Taylor?</quote>
   <p>The interruption caught him by surprise. Remember this frail
little old woman? He'd never seen her before in his life.

<text id=LOBN08>
   <p>But there was none. Only silence.
   <p>I staggered to my feet, went over to the packing-cases, rummaged
among them. They had been held together, bound, with galvanized wire.
I began to twist and turn, feeling the wire heat up between my
fingers, begin to burn my flesh, but I ignored it and kept twisting
until a piece of about six inches in length came free.
   <p>I limped back to the door, knelt again. The lock was massive but
ancient and simple. There was no key in it. I could look straight
through into the dimming light in the corridor. I probed with the
wire, got to the tumbler and lifted. But the wire bent. I cursed,
pulled it clear, straightened it, tried again, but again it bent.
   <p><squote>Here,</squote> Seona's voice from behind me. She had a nail in her
hand, a long nail, stronger than the wire. I snatched it from her,
probed again, lifted and this time the tumbler rose a little way
before it slipped back into place. I paused, wiped sweat from my brow
and listened at the door. If the guard was still outside he must have
heard the attempts at picking the lock. But all was still. With
trembling fingers I thrust with the nail, the tumbler rose the whole
way and the lock snapped open.
   <p>My nerves were jangling. I stood for a second with my back
against the door, breathing heavily, then I turned and slowly,
stealthily I eased it open. It creaked. My heart missed a beat. I
waited. Still no sound from outside. I opened the door wide.
   <p>Carefully I looked out into the passageway. The chair was empty,
cigarette-ends littered the floor beside it and in the gloomy light of
evening I could look straight along to the hallway. It, too, was
empty.
   <p>I grasped Seona's arm, pulled her with me as I went silently
along the passage keeping close to the wall. My groin was paining: it
was swollen but somehow it didn't seem so bad now.
   <p>We came to the hallway. Still the silence, an eerie silence. I
didn't know what to make of it.
   <p><squote>Stay here,</squote> I said to the girl, and then on my toes I went
over to the main door, looked out into the courtyard. It was empty.
The truck had gone. I beckoned. Seona came to join me.
   <p>My lips were against her ear, her hair brushing my face. <squote>You
know the road to the coast. You know of Farrel. Ask for him. Go to
him or De Sotto.</squote>
   <p>Her face turned. I looked into her eyes. <squote>And you?</squote>
   <p><squote>I will follow,</squote>, I said hastily. <squote>I have to find out if he
is still here. I will not be far behind you.</squote>
   <p><squote>No,</squote> she said, her voice little more than a whisper. <squote>We
have come this far together. I will not leave you now. You may need
my help. Besides, the little man has said that Jeronimo's men are
between us and the coast.</squote>
   <p><squote>Do as you're told.</squote> My voice was harsh, impatient.
   <p><squote>No. We go together.</squote>
   <p>There wasn't time to argue. I took her by the hand, went quickly
over to the stairs, began to climb, placing my feet carefully on each
step, keeping close in the deep shadow of the balustrade and at the
top of the stairs I stopped, bent double and looked each way along the
length of the landing, along the dim empty silence of it.
   <p>On to the landing then, padding softly, making for the far end.
Double doors stood open. I looked inside to a bare empty room. The
evening breeze blew gently in through windows from which most of the
glazing had gone. On to the next room. The doors were shut. Slowly
I opened them a fraction, looked in. It showed signs of recent
occupation. Papers scattered over the floor. Cigarette-ends too. A
couple of what seemed to be pin-up pictures stuck to one wall.
   <p>Then on to the next room, and the next, working my way along,
seeing signs of some of them having been in use until at last I came
to the room where I had met Jeronimo. I was more careful here. I
used the keyhole first. But it too was deserted, most of the
furniture covered by dust sheets, and I stood for a moment or so,
frowning, puzzled, not knowing what to make of it.
   <p>Next to it was a bedroom, fully furnished, a great canopied bed
occupying most of it. The bed was still made up. I left it, went on
and two doors farther on, and almost at the end of a landing, I turned
a handle, went in to a horrible sickening stench.
   <p>I staggered back. Behind me Seona retreated hurriedly. I went
forward again into darkness. I still had the matches. I struck one
and in the light from the tiny flame I saw shuttered windows, saw a
low truckle-bed, a small table beside it, and on the bed a form, the
form of someone covered by a blanket.
   <p>On the table stood a small oil lamp. I held my breath, went over
to it, raised the glass, lighted it and the room filled with a warm
mellow light.
   <p>Gingerly I raised the edge of the blanket. A dead face looked up
at me, the eyes closed, dark-ringed, the face waxen and showing still
the lines of pain and suffering. Hurriedly I ripped away the blanket
from the body. It was naked, the body of a man, well built and young:
one arm was still bandaged, an arm which was swollen to enormous
proportions and stinking, gangrenous. His other arm lay across his
chest, unnaturally, as if placed there deliberately, for a purpose. I
bent closer, saw the pinprick of the hole made by a hypodermic
syringe. Someone had been merciful.
   <p>I threw the blanket back on him. His clothing lay piled over a
chair, trousers, shoes, socks, underclothing, a shirt, but no jacket.
I picked up the shirt. The right sleeve had been ripped open. It
was heavily bloodstained.
   <p>The right sleeve. I went cold. It had been that same sleeve of
Baker's raincoat which had been torn, ripped open. But this wasn't
Baker. Baker was on the short side, past middle age and sandy-haired,
balding. The room seemed to whirl around me. I couldn't think. This
was beyond me.
   <p>I went back to the clothing, rummaged through the pockets of the
trousers. They held nothing. I looked around for the jacket. There
was no sign of it. I flung the clothing back on to the chair and as I
did so I noticed the shoulder holster. It hung by the side of the
chair, partly concealed from me. I picked it up, drew out the
automatic. A P.38. A full clip in the butt, a spare clip attached to
the holster. Quickly I slipped off my jacket, hung the holster from
my shoulder and shrugged into the jacket again.
   <p>Then I went over to the lamp, bent to blow it out. The sooner I
made contact now with Farrel the better. From behind me in the
doorway I heard the slither of footsteps. I had forgotten Seona. I
turned to see what she was doing and I froze. Standing in the
doorway, her nose wrinkled in disgust at the smell in the room, was
the woman Jeronimo had called Elsa. Behind her, peering round her,
were Ginetti and one of the boys, surprise on their faces, and in her
hand pointing straight at me was a long-barrelled Luger.
<head>9</head>
   <p><squote>TAKE your hand away from the lamp.</squote> Her voice was high and
thin and sharp. She stayed in the doorway, perhaps because of the
stench from the body, perhaps because even though she had the gun in
her hand she felt safer with distance between us. Ginetti was by her
side and slightly behind her, her shoulder blocking him from the room
while the boy peered in between them.
   <p>Slowly I straightened, let my hands drop away from the lamp.
   <p><squote>Come away from it.</squote>
   <p>I moved a couple of steps nearer her.
   <p><squote>That's enough.</squote>
   <p>I stopped, tense, every muscle in my body taut, my mind reeling,
trying to find a way to cope with the situation.
   <p><squote>How did you get out?</squote>
   <p>I didn't answer. My eyes were fixed on the pistol she held, on
the finger which was crooked around the trigger and which showed white
with the pressure she was exerting. I was close, very close to death.
   <p><squote>How did you get out?</squote>
   <p>Still I was silent. Her voice had risen still higher. She was
nervous, uncertain, and I gauged the distance between us judging
whether I could get to her before she could pull the trigger. But
eight feet or more separated us: and Ginetti too had his pistol in his
hand, as always held loosely by his side but nevertheless ready for
action. Then the boy: it was obvious that he too would be armed.
   <p><squote>Answer me.</squote>
   <p>The voice was a danger signal, a sign of nerves reaching a pitch
when anything could happen.
   <p><squote>Through the door,</squote> I mumbled, my mouth dry. <squote>How else?</squote>
   <p>She seemed to relax a little, but only a little. <squote>And the
girl?</squote>
   <p><squote>Gone,</squote> I said.
   <p><squote>Christ!</squote> Ginetti's voice broke in. He looked frightened.
<squote>Jeronimo's got to be told. And now. Don't play with him,
Contessa. Shoot him. Get him out of the way.</squote>
   <p>Nervously she licked her lips. <squote>Yes,</squote> she said, and her voice
was uncertain. But all the same she set herself more firmly on her
feet and the barrel of the pistol quivered as an extra pressure was
put on the trigger.
   <p>And inside me my nerves seemed to shiver, to jar. Now. It was
coming now. And I gathered myself to leap at her, to try and get the
pistol before it went off.
   <p>But nothing happened. It is no easy matter to kill in cold blood
if you haven't the mentality for that sort of thing. Very few women
have. Vicious though she looked the Contessa was no exception.
   <p><squote>Get out of my way.</squote> Ginetti's voice had risen. He seemed to
be panicking a little, to be losing control. <squote>Move. Let me do
it.</squote>
   <p>He edged forward, began to shoulder her aside, to get freedom for
the arm and the hand which held the pistol. The boy had closed in
upon the two in front of him so that they were now grouped tightly
together in the doorway. And then my heart lurched. A shadowy figure
appeared behind them, a figure who could only be Seona, who moved up
to them, into them.
   <p>She must have jumped at them, her arms outstretched, and she
caught the Contessa full in the back, sending her staggering in at me
and barging Ginetti violently to one side as she did so. And at the
same time I leaped to one side, the Luger going off almost in my face,
the bullet missing me by inches as I swayed back at her and chopped in
a blow with the edge of my palm alongside her jaw. Her head snapped
violently around and sideways, her eyes rolled to show the whites as
she slumped to the ground.
   <p>And then Ginetti. He hadn't a chance. He was down on one knee
and I was on to him before he had time to do anything. Again that
chopping blow, a blow that could kill if aimed at the right spot, but
this time on the wrist of the hand which held his pistol, and hard,
really hard. I heard his gasp of pain, heard too the clatter of the
gun hitting the floor as I brought my knee up violently into his face
to send him flying backwards on to the landing.
   <p>I staggered with the effort, then gathered myself ready to deal
with the boy. He had slipped back. He had a shotgun, the shortened
barrels swinging as he wrestled with Seona: a Seona whose teeth showed
in a tigerish fury as she pushed and pulled, the knuckles of her hands
white as she gripped on those barrels, fighting to keep them away from
me.

   <p><quote>My dear Frank. When you hear this, I shall be dead. It is
now ten o'clock and I am quite alone in the laboratory. I have
fastened the door and am now seated before the recorder. Frank, I
have invented a weapon which I call Liquid Glass. The atom bomb
causes death by fire. My invention causes death by freezing. Liquid
Glass is in the form of small crystals. Five of these crystals
enclosed within a glass cylinder are sufficient, when dropped from a
plane, to reduce the land beneath to a thick crust of ice. All people
caught within the belt are frozen to death instantly. Therefore,
should a free nation be threatened by another, they can meet the
menace of their enemy's atomic fire with the introduction of a new Ice
Age. I have placed my formula in a secret cache for greater safety,
for I fear, Frank &mdash; I very much fear &mdash; that I am shadowed and that
some person may have more than a faint inkling as to what I have
brought into being. Have you ever heard talk concerning three men who
are known as the Terrible Three, who have managed so far to elude
capture. Their field of operation is world wide, but there is a
rumour that they are at present in the States. These three men have
the reputation of possessing superb nerve and cunning. I know many
inside stories of the happenings under cover within Europe. The
merest glimpse of a man's face is sufficient warning to the initiated,
but I have no proof. Therefore be on your guard.
   <p><quote>Now for your instructions.
   <p><quote>Snatch a moment when the house is unoccupied &mdash; but don't send
the servants out too obviously &mdash; then go upstairs to the attic. In
the second room you will find a line of pictures resting against the
wall. Choose Psyche and Pan, and take off the back. Between this
outer covering you will see a sealed packet. The words <squote>Liquid
Glass</squote> are written upon the envelope. Take it to Professor Slade,
<squote>Carmel,</squote> Balfour Crescent, New York. Once it is in his possession
your task is completed. But whilst this operation is in progress I
beg you to use the utmost discretion. Trust no one; neither a friend
nor a beloved one. Remember &mdash; you will be holding dynamite.
   <p><quote>There remains nothing more for me to say, I think.
   <p><quote>Thank you, Frank. I know you will do it... well.</quote>
   <p>The tape ran on soundlessly until Frank, breaking the spell,
pressed the fast-wind switch. Now he understood the Professor's agony
of indecision. This was, indeed, the answer to the atomic bomb, but
what a fearful answer. He felt the mantle of responsibility
descending upon his own shoulders.
   <p>Lifting off the tape, he hesitated over what he should do with
it. He could of course remove the message, but he naturally preferred
to carry it with the sealed packet to Slade. In the meanwhile where
could he keep the tape? He dared not leave it about, so he decided to
carry it perpetually around with him. This point settled, he
reflected he wanted to take a shower. When he'd tied the belt of his
bathrobe he slipped the tape into the pocket. Within the shower
compartment his brain ran riot, in company with the falling jets of
water. He ran his fingers through his hair while he figured.
   <p><quote>I only need the right opportunity to snatch the packet, then
carry it to New York and my part is over.</quote> When he returned to his
room he found he was again looking around for the unexpected. <quote>It's
too darned easy to let your imagination take the reins,</quote> he
admonished himself. He did not really believe Zinnerman's secret was
known. He didn't credit the Professor's notion that he'd been
trailed. <quote>No &mdash; just a sick man weaving fantasies, and you'd better
watch out for yourself,</quote> he warned, <quote>or you will be starting on the
same road, too.</quote> He turned the key softly in the lock for the first
time since he'd slept in this house. Half an hour later Frank lay on
his bed in the inner room. He was smoking and flicking over the pages
of a book. The tape now reposed beneath his pillow. It seemed to him
that the night was endless. Had he the least hope that he'd sleep?
At length he laid aside his cigarette end in a silver tray and turned
out the light. In retrospect he saw again Zinnerman's face close to
his, and felt the Professor's hands gripping his shoulders. He
relived the scene in the laboratory, then he drifted into sleep. What
was that! Frank sat up and listened. He heard a sharp click-click.
He switched on the table lamp, swung his feet to the floor and
reached for his robe.
   <p><quote>Is anyone there?</quote> he called.
   <p>In the next room he groped for the light button and flooded the
apartment with illumination. He had to wait a minute to adjust his
own vision. Then going over to the door he released it. The passage
was empty.
   <p><quote>Is someone there?</quote> he queried. No one replied. No sound
disturbed the heavy silence which now ruled the house.
   <p>He closed his door. His watch registered two o'clock. He
extinguished the lamp and pulled back the heavy drapes from the
window. The dark sky was lit by a silver moon boat. The trees were
scarcely discernible; a serene autumnal scene.
   <p>He wandered back into his bedroom. Here, he shook out a
Stuyvesant from the packet on the small table and used his lighter.
Seated on the side of the bed he commenced to evolve plans for the
morrow.
<head>CHAPTER TWO</head>
<head>FRENZIED WEB</head>
   <p>THE NEW DAY proved a whirlpool of activity. Frank had to
cope with dozens of letters, attend to callers, and take each phone
call which occurred about every fifteen minutes. At mid-day Benn
entered Frank's study carrying a tray. Frank wanted only a sandwich
and a glass of milk for luncheon, and as the butler deposited the tray
upon the desk he asked if he might slip out for half an hour.
   <p><quote>Sure,</quote> Frank agreed absently. Then as the man departed
realisation dawned. With Benn removed, the house would be virtually
empty. The other two servants had gone out a while since. Johnson
was in the laboratory with sufficient work to occupy him for an hour
at least. He'd been very late the previous night and was trying
desperately to make up the time he'd lost. He had hinted to Frank
that he'd had a lot of fun and consumed quite a number of highballs.
Possibly he'd been responsible for the noise that had woken him,
Frank had decided; and now within a short span of time he would have
his chance within his grasp. He waited until he heard the front door
slam; made a quick check to ascertain that the house really was
untenanted, then he swiftly mounted the stairs which led to the next
storey.
   <p>He opened a door. The first room looked rather eerie in the
faint light filtering in from the lowered shades. Frank crossed to
the second door and turned the handle. There were several pieces of
furniture stored in here.
   <p>Resting against the opposite wall were a row of pictures, gilded
frames turned towards the wall. He examined each in turn, then as the
fifth picture passed through his hands he knew with quickening pulses
that this was the one he sought. A lovely study of the kneeling
Psyche imploring the aid of Pan who, in his genial way, was apparently
giving advice to the stricken girl who had lost her lover through her
own imprudence and mistrust.
   <p>Frank produced his penknife and gently attacked the back of the
picture. He was aware that the task must be delicately done. He owed
that to Zinnerman. At length it was finished and the square piece of
plywood fell away.
   <p>There, resting against the canvas was a small sealed packet,
measuring not more than six inches by four. He lifted it up and read
<squote>Liquid Glass</squote> inscribed in the Professor's neat script. He
slipped the package into his pocket, and then commenced the work of
restoring the picture in as perfect a condition as before. When he
was at last satisfied he came away and descended the staircase. He
strode swiftly into his room &mdash; and stopped &mdash; eyes riveted upon his
black jacket lying across a chair. Within the right hand pocket
reposed the tape. How could he have been so careless as to leave it
here? But it was all right, he reflected the next instant. The
dwelling was deserted. Nevertheless his conscience troubled him as he
slid his hand into the pocket to recover it. The tape was not
there. He explored the left side pocket, and again drew blank.
Where was it? He was certain beyond a shadow of doubt that he
placed it there this morning.
   <p>His gaze flashed around. There was a tape on the recorder which
he'd left bare last night. He bounded over to the machine. The tape
was a quarter wound off.
   <p>He switched on, fast-wound, and pressed the playback button.
With an indescribable shock he heard Zinnerman's voice saying the
first words of his message.
   <p>Frank stopped the machine and stood taut. Someone had been in
this room during his absence. For a moment he could not move as
realisation flooded his brain, then he fled into the corridor.
   <p><quote>Who is there?</quote> he shouted.
   <p>His voice echoed &mdash; and there was no reply. He made a swift
search of the first floor rooms and rushed down the stairs to explore
the rest. He found no one.
   <p>He ran across the lawn to the laboratory and threw the door wide.
Johnson, who seemed to be terribly busy, glanced up at him in an
apparently startled fashion.
   <p><quote>Hello, Frank,</quote> he greeted. <quote>Have you come to give me a
hand? That sure would be acceptable.</quote>
   <p>Frank ignored this.
   <p><quote>Did you come into the house just now?</quote> he demanded abruptly.
   <p>Johnson ruffled up his hair.
   <p><quote>Who, me?</quote> he exclaimed. <quote>Good God, no. I've far too much
to do, but if you were thinking of brewing coffee, I'd love some.
Better make it black though. I went out on the town last night.</quote>
   <p>Frank stared at him, trying to read within Johnson's eyes whether
he was speaking the truth or not. Then Frank withdrew, closing the
door after him. He went swiftly back up to his room and removing the
tape, slid it into his pocket. He thought wretchedly, <quote>How much
harm have I caused already?</quote> It was abundantly clear to him than an
intruder had been here, but just how far that person had advanced in
knowledge was open to speculation. He might only have had time to
hear a part of the tape, or &mdash; he was now as wise as Frank was. How
could he tell? There just wasn't time to waste in self-reproach for
this criminal carelessness on his part. There was only one thing to
do &mdash; think fast, and decide just how the situation should be remedied.
   <p>He moved over to the window and looked down upon the garden.
Johnson, of course, was the most probable candidate for the unknown
intruder. If only there was some way of checking up on him.
   <p>The tall trees stood sentinel below dressed in their garlands of
russet leaves. Autumn. The loveliest season of the year.
   <p>A figure was crossing the stone courtyard below. Benn, returning
from his errand no doubt.
   <p>Frank turned away. Then a new line of thought arrested him.
Could this have been the work of a stranger? A person Frank had
never seen? A creature well adapted in the art of a quiet unnoticed
entry and a swift melting away afterwards when the task had been
completed? A saboteur perhaps? One of the Terrible Three?
   <p>But let him deal with facts known. However much his enemy had
learned there was one point he couldn't be aware of, namely that Frank
had already secured the packet.

   <p>Feeling rather diminished by being reduced to such an obvious
manoeuvre, Sam swung abruptly round a corner, vaulted, as silently as
he could, over a low garden wall, and crouched in the prickly refuge
of a bush.
   <p>The following footsteps panicked. They were almost running.
Evidently the trailer was a novice.
   <p>Then Sam saw that the footsteps belonged to the man with a
straggly beard, the one who had claimed Han's attention at the party.
   <p>Suddenly Sam felt reckless. He wasn't going to wait for danger
written in the stars. He was going to write his own autobiography.
Without taking any further precautions, Sam followed the follower.
   <p>The man lost his nerve, and turned to face Sam.
   <p><squote>Well?</squote> Sam demanded.
   <p>The straggly beard trembled.
   <p><squote>I was trying to catch up with you, sir.</squote>
   <p><squote>What a coincidence! for it seems,</squote> Sam pointed out, <squote>that I
have caught up with you.</squote>
   <p>But the other was recovering his composure.
   <p><squote>I was waiting,</squote> he explained, <squote>till we passed a bar. Then I
was going to ask you to have a drink with me. I asked Han to tell me
about you...</squote>
   <p><squote>We'll talk here,</squote> Sam answered, <squote>Mr... er...?</squote>
   <p><squote>Singh,</squote> said the bearded man as if he were conferring a
favour. <squote>My name is Singh, but I wanted to talk to you about
Foster.</squote>
   <p><squote>So many names!</squote> said Sam. <squote>Why should you want to talk to
me about Foster? It happened before I came to this country.</squote>
   <p>Singh said, <squote>I think there is going to be a storm.</squote>
   <p>The night, certainly, seemed to be loaded with thunder; and Sam
wondered how intolerable the other's social manners could get. Were
they now going to talk about the weather?
   <p>Sam was conscious of his muscles absorbing the secrets of
flexion. There was a tremendous synaptic gathering inside him. But
would it be worth pulling such a silly little beard?
   <p><squote>I'm glad you know about Foster,</squote> Singh said.
   <p>But one would need a genius for letting the world rip by not to
know about Foster. Newspapers had bellowed headlines about the
settler who'd complained that his native gardener was getting too
interested in his wife, and who'd slugged the man so hard that he'd
pushed him into eternity. Foster had always been hitting his native
servants, but with the gardener he had gone too far.
   <p><squote>It's only right that Foster should hang,</squote> Singh said curtly.
<squote>Yet this New Government may not like to start what they call a New
Era with the execution of a white man. They may feel that it will
bias their relations with other Western Powers. So I would like you
to sign our petition. As a visitor from The States, your signature
would mean so much...</squote>
   <p>But the man had not even troubled to ask Sam whether he believed
in capital punishment, whether he thought that vengeance was a dish
best eaten cold! Of course it was not right that the black men who
killed whites should always be punished, while the white men who
killed blacks should go free. If there was a law, it should be
impartial. But was capital punishment part of any law that could be
justified?
   <p>Singh would say, Sam was sure, that Sam was standing with the
white men when he waved away the petition. But surely he was doing
more than that? For Sam ought to be prejudiced. Sam was as black as
night. That was why his mother, not knowing his father, had called
him Sam Dark. <squote>My name's trash,</squote> she'd said, <squote>but we'll give you
a nice one, so that you can be proud of yourself.</squote>
   <p>Sam said, <squote>Mr. Singh, I'm going to return to my hotel. In
the circumstances, perhaps you'd give me ten minutes' start. I do not
wish to walk with you, or have you on my heels.</squote>
   <p>After that, there was no tail of footsteps just out of synchrony;
and when Sam passed the first small bar that was open, he took his own
solitary footsteps into it. The place was utterly undistinguished,
but Sam wanted to drink away the taste of Mary Parker and Mr. Singh
with his wish to see Foster strung up from the rafters. And after he
had drunk away the rancid taste, Sam wanted to think of Han.
   <p>He did not know how long he spent drinking, and his thoughts
reached no conclusions. He left the bar finally because the
proprietor begged him to go.
   <p>
   <p>THERE was no sign of the night porter or of any of the
night staff at the hotel. Yet Sam wanted one last cool glass before
going to his room and the whirling fans. After all, Grandad's Soda
Pop was paying enough to justify Sam throwing a little weight around.
Sam, the consultant on market research in relation to coloured
citizens in America, who'd been yanked out of the advertising
department and sent off as ambassadorial salesman to the New State.
Sam, the Soda Pop salesman, who kept his finger jammed on the bell;
but the eerie thing was that he felt that nobody would come, that
somehow the luxury hotel was adrift and floating away without a crew
into the stifling night.
   <p>He looked for another bell, in case the one he had been ringing
was at fault. When he found it, he jabbed it with a viciousness that
surprised him.
   <p>He might have saved his finger; but obstinacy made him sit
himself down in a padded chair. Surely sooner or later some servant
would have to pass through the foyer?
   <p>But it was a long term policy, and Sam began to weary. He
realised that he might acquire a skull cap of dust before anything
happened. He decided that the hotel had won the round, and he got up
and moved over to the lifts.
   <p>But when Sam flipped on the light inside his room, he was no
longer alone: there was someone on his bed, a woman who had made
herself at home and had gone to sleep!
   <p>It was Mary Parker, the bogus fortune teller who <quote>read</quote> the
vibrations accumulated on things people had carried around them, the
impetus of fate, psychometry.
   <p>Mary wasn't handsome when she was awake, and asleep she looked
ghastly.
   <p>Then Sam realised that Mary was dead.
   <p>He saw the penknife.
   <p>His penknife.
   <p>It was plunged into the old woman's heart.
   <p>Sam staggered into his private bathroom and passed a wet sponge
over his face. Then he unhooked the shaving mirror and took it back
to the bedroom. He put the mirror over Mary Parker's mouth. Mary was
dead all right.
   <p>There wasn't much blood, but Sam knew that if he pulled out the
knife there'd be plenty.
   <p>Ought he to pull out the knife? It wouldn't help the witch now,
and a lot of blood would be awkward if...
   <p>If what?
   <p>If he took the body down to the foyer and left it in a chair in
that mausoleum. A blood trail would be a confession. He could
recover his knife in the foyer, and let the corpse bleed comfortably
into the cushions...
   <p>Yes, Sam's one obsessive idea was &mdash; to get rid of the body. What
had happened and how it had happened, these were hideous questions
which would have to wait.
   <p>Sam would have liked to have complained to the management! What
damned right had they to give permission to a caller to wait for a
guest in his room? Such slipshod security was bound to lead to
trouble. Even if Mary had given a wink meaning ~<quote>Sam's expecting
me</quote>, they oughtn't to have fallen for that flattering assumption of
sophistication. This was supposed to be a first-class hotel in the
New State, and not a brothel under the Old Regime.
   <p>Jesus!... if Mary's body was found in Sam's room with Sam's knife
pinning it down to the dimension of eternity...
   <p>Although Sam wanted to concentrate on getting the body out of the
room, he couldn't control his thoughts. But he tried to force himself
to number off the tasks in hand: 1) Drag the corpse to the door, 2)
Look out to see if the coast was clear, 3) Get to the lift before the
night porter took to operating the damned thing again, 4) Get back to
the bedroom and change clothes in case of bloodstains, 5) Think up a
good bluff if some minion came up with a story about showing Mary
Parker up to Sam's room.
   <p>But to perdition with trying to think straight. What was needed
was a little crooked action.
   <p>Sam forced himself back to the bedside, and put out his arms to
grab the corpse under the arm pits...
   <p><squote>Dear me, Mr. Dark, I would have thought that any further
violence was quite unnecessary...</squote>
   <p>Sam spun round.
   <p>A small man, who was pushing out his lips as if he wanted to kiss
or be kissed, had come silently into the room.
   <p><squote>Oh dear,</squote> he said, <squote>I'm the hotel detective.</squote>
   <p>Sam goggled at him.
   <p><squote>Where the devil have you been?</squote> he said bitterly. <squote>Why
can't you prevent this sort of thing happening?</squote>
   <p><squote>Do you think I could have done that, Mr. Dark? I can't be
everywhere at once, you know. We've had trouble with an old lady who
lost a valuable brooch. I've been interviewing all the staff. The
old lady insisted on it. Of course in the end we discovered that
she'd used the brooch for pinning a cheque to her laundry list. Old
ladies are capable of anything. You'd never credit what they'll do
without a second thought.
   <p><squote>They stick a hat pin into a tiresome dog or leave a valuable
brooch in a laundry list, and then forget all about it. Whereas you
and I, we'd have a twinge of conscience, wouldn't we? or else we'd be
a bloody sight more careful.</squote>
   <p>The little man tried to suck in his lips, but there wasn't much
he could do about it.
   <p><squote>My name is Ralph Chand,</squote> he said, <squote>and you ought to be
pleased to see me. Perhaps I've prevented you from doing something
foolish. We do get flustered, don't we, in a crisis?</squote>
   <p>Sam was speechless. Do hotel detectives talk like nursery
governesses? We must eat up all our bread and butter before we
have any cake, mustn't we?
   <p>Then Sam tensed. Perhaps this imbecile was the murderer who'd
come back to gloat and perhaps to do some more damage?
   <p>Chand said conversationally, <squote>Stabbed, isn't she? But if you
prefer it, she could be poisoned or strangled. We must suit your
personality. But you are a man who carries a knife, aren't you?</squote>
   <p>Sam felt his eyes swelling like bubbles.
   <p><squote>Will you say that again?</squote> he demanded faintly.
   <p><squote>Perhaps, Mr. Dark,</squote> Chand said brusquely, <squote>you are finding
it hard to believe in me? Do you think I ought to be holding a gun in
one hand and a pair of handcuffs in the other? Here is my warrant.
You will verify, I hope, that it is perfectly in order.</squote>
   <p>It looked real
   <p><squote>And now,</squote> said the hotel detective, <squote>I will have to ask you
to accompany me.</squote>
   <p>Sam stepped back.
   <p><squote>Oh no,</squote> he retorted, <squote>I'll wait here till the real police
take charge. I don't want to be locked in the kitchen and told I've
got to wash dishes for the rest of my life.</squote>
   <p>The detective succeeded in getting his lower lip under his upper
teeth, and then he released it again. It sprang back to the bulge as
if to attack.
   <p><squote>Sir,</squote> Mr. Chand said firmly, <squote>what you want is a lawyer.
After this unfortunate incident, he'll be waiting for us. The best
lawyer in town, Mr. Dark; and he's our acting President while
Bassanto is in Nyamba. I could not take you to a higher authority.</squote>
   <p>Sam lifted the telephone, and to his amazement it was answered
almost immediately. Anyone would think the hotel was running to
orderly schedule.
   <p>Sam said, <squote>Give me police headquarters.</squote>
   <p>The girl on the switchboard did not seem to be surprised.

<text id=LOBN11>
   <p>I drank off the Scotch.
   <p><squote>We'd better find out,</squote> I said. <squote>Another one, Sergeant?</squote>
   <p>He grinned.
   <p><squote>May as well make a night of it, sir, don't you think?</squote>
   <p>
   <p>We made it quite a session.
   <p>In the next two hours I gathered more information about Sergeant
Ellison than I had in all the time I'd known him. The bar at the
Bloomsbury was a quiet sort of place, and we drank just about enough
to loosen our tongues. That was all to the good because, apart from a
load of irrelevant data, I picked up an odd fact about him that,
though it seemed unimportant, came in very handy later on.
   <p>I tried to draw him out on Malaya and the rubber plantations, and
after a time he weighed in with some of the problems of Indian labour.
Strikes, it appeared, had always been blowing up on the flimsiest
pretext, and he went on to talk about one that had threatened to
paralyse production just before the war.
   <p><squote>That,</squote> he remarked, <squote>was when I learnt to drive an
engine.</squote>
   <p><squote>You mean a railway engine?</squote>
   <p><squote>A small one.</squote> He grinned. <squote>Much smaller than anything
you'll see down at Ravi, but the cab lay-out's roughly the same. We
had a branch line connecting the plantation with the main Singapore
track. When the strike came we had to keep the wagons on the move,
and there was only one way to do it.</squote>
   <p>I asked him half-jokingly whether he thought he could drive the
Calcutta-Peshawar express.
   <p><squote>If I had to drive it out of hell into heaven,</squote> he said, <squote>I'd
at least have a damn good try.</squote>
   <p>We were neither of us talking in deadly earnest, and I'd no idea
then that I'd ever need to ask him to drive a locomotive. Yet when
the time came that I needed a driver and seconds were precious, the
little that I'd learnt about him that evening snapped into mind with a
sweetness that made all the difference.
   <p>
   <p>Looking back, I learnt quite a lot that was useful in the course
of that couple of hours at the Bloomsbury.
   <p>It was close on eleven o'clock when I left, and as I turned the
jeep towards the gates, another car came blaring up the road from the
station. It was an American make, half the size of a tank and
unmistakably belonged to Sarwate. I'd seen it too often at Dalgoorie
to have any doubts about that.
   <p>I caught sight of his face, all flesh, peering through the
windscreen, and beside him a woman in a sari.
   <p>I couldn't see her features. She was turned away from me, but
she seemed to be young.
   <p>It must have been the Scotch, but right at that moment I felt
very much alone, a world away from Fay. I muttered an entreaty that
the next three nights at least would be quiet; then, swinging the jeep
on to the tarmac, I followed Sarwate up the hill.
<head>22. A LUSCIOUS LITTLE WINDFALL</head>
   <p>I slept soundly from midnight to six in the morning, and woke
feeling more thoroughly rested than I had for ten days. There'd been
no hornet-buzz from the bazar and no jangling telephone-bells in the
small hours. Some distant Hindu deity, possibly Vishnu the Preserver
in one of his nine incarnations, had lent an ear to the prayer of an
unbeliever and laid a peaceful hand on Kulachi. That was one thing to
be thankful for at any rate, and to me there was another that was
equally if not more important. This was Tuesday. It was August the
eleventh, and Fay was arriving from Delhi.
   <p>I slipped on a pair of sandals, snatched myself a quick, cool
shower and a dollop of breakfast, and ran the jeep down to Area
Headquarters with the airy feeling that in spite of the heat I was
going to remember this day as a pleasanter landmark of monsoon 1942.
   <p>Betty had only just arrived, but she'd called at the Signals
Section on the way and picked up what messages there were. One of
them was sealed in an envelope and labelled TOP SECRET &mdash; obviously
from G.H.Q. &mdash; and I slit the flap and pulled out the folded
slip of paper with all kinds of misgivings. Not that I was
desperately worried about Fay. I'd spoken to her on the phone less
than twenty-four hours before, and she hadn't seemed in any way upset;
but, from my own narrow shave outside the Kutcherry, I knew just how
little was needed to spark off an outbreak of violence, how swiftly a
peaceful street could become as dangerous as a valley in the path of a
crumbling dam. The mere mention of Delhi, on this of all days, was
calculated to set all my nerve-ends tingling; and with the Press and
radio clamped into virtual silence on the subject, there were only two
sources of news: rumour, which was wild and unreliable and reports
from G.H.Q., which were reliable as far as they went, but
which, I suspected, never told more than a quarter of the truth.
   <p>Still, casting an eye down the message, I didn't see anything to
cause immediate concern. The only mention of Delhi was in the context
of student demonstrations, but all hell, it seemed, had been let loose
in Bombay. A railway station had been raided, a Government grain-shop
looted and burnt, telegraph wires cut and stones thrown at trains.
The police and the military had had to intervene and there'd been a
number of casualties, some of them fatal.
   <p>There'd also been some firing in Lucknow and Poona, and more
trouble in Ahmedabad; but it was even more disturbing to find no
reference at all to what had happened at Kulachi. At least half a
dozen places were detailed in connection with what were called <squote>minor
disturbances</squote>, but I couldn't spot Kulachi anywhere among them.
   <p>That made me think, not once but three times. I knew the Brig
had sent a wire up to District, and both Rob and Scattergood must have
made their own individual reports, and yet what I'd seen down in the
Sadar Bazar wasn't even classed as a <squote>minor disturbance</squote>. I looked
down my nose at the message, and wondered what the hell sort of
trouble G.H.Q. meant when they talked about <squote>a student
demonstration</squote>.
   <p>Then I realized abruptly that it wasn't worth the effort. Even
if they meant what Rob described as <squote>wilful bloody murder</squote>, there
was nothing I could do to prevent it. Delhi was a hundred and fifty
miles across the Ganges plain, and that was a damned sight too far.
In six hours Fay would be sitting in a train, and until it was time
to wheel the jeep down to Jagapur to meet her, the best thing I could
do was to forget the whole business completely.
   <p>I floated the message-form to Betty and told her to file it.
   <p><squote>And give the D.S.P. a tinkle,</squote> I added. <squote>See if
he'll be down at the Kutcherry in half an hour's time. I want to have
a word with him about a bungalow at Ravi.</squote>
   <p>She reached for the phone, but before she could so much as lift
the receiver the bell began to ring.
   <p><squote>Damn,</squote> I said. <squote>Find out who it is.</squote>
   <p>She found out. It was Rob, and I took the phone from her.
   <p><squote>I was just going to toddle down and see you,</squote> I told him.
<squote>I've a small twist of dope about our friend from Asifabad.</squote>
   <p>I heard him chuckle down the wire.
   <p><squote>I've got more than that. I've a packet right here that'll make
your eyes pop.</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh? What's in it?</squote>
   <p><squote>Another twist of something that's turned up at last.</squote>
   <p><squote>That tells me a hell of a lot, doesn't it?</squote>
   <p><squote>Yes,</squote> he said, <squote>it's meant to.</squote>
   <p><squote>D'you want me to guess?</squote>
   <p><squote>Not while we're talking on the blower. Just get toddling, old
son.</squote>
   <p>I told him I'd be with him in roughly ten minutes.
   <p><squote>Make it five,</squote> he urged. <squote>This is manna from the skies.
It's a luscious little windfall if ever there was one.</squote>
   <p><squote>What shall I bring then? A spoon or a penknife?</squote>
   <p><squote>Neither,</squote> he said. <squote>Pack a thinking cap. That's all we're
going to need.</squote>
   <p>
   <p>I did more than toddle. I was down at the Kutcherry in six
minutes flat.
   <p>Rob was standing by his desk gazing down at a black metal box on
the floor. It was the sort of box that anyone could have bought in
any of a thousand bazars: a small tin trunk, flat-topped, fitted with
a hasp and staple and secured by a padlock. There were millions of
them in India.
   <p>This one, from the look of it, had seen better days. It was
scratched and dented, the hasp was broken and some sharp concussion at
some time or other had strained at the hinges. The paint had long
since lost all its gloss, but I could see very faintly the letters
<squote>M.F.</squote> lacquered in white on the lid.
   <p><squote>Some windfall,</squote> I remarked.
   <p><squote>Don't kick it,</squote> said Rob. <squote>Sit down. Have you heard about
the bus?</squote>
   <p><squote>What bus?</squote>
   <p><squote>First one down the hill from Dalgoorie this morning. Struck a
patch of oil on one of the hairpins and nose-dived over the side of
the \khud.</squote>
   <p>I wasn't surprised. The buses on the winding road to the hills
were the kind I remembered on country routes in England back in the
late nineteen-twenties: rattling affairs, sparingly sprung, with
bulbous horns and a single door at the rear. They were driven with
erratic and reckless fury by a team of Sikhs, and on the odd occasions
when necessity had forced me to use them I'd suffered a multitude of
hideous deaths in the course of an hour's fertile imagination.
   <p>I said as much to Rob, and asked him how far this one had
dropped.
   <p><squote>Five hundred feet, almost sheer,</squote> he replied. <squote>Finished up
in a stream. Little of it left except for the chassis.</squote>
   <p><squote>Any military personnel aboard?</squote>
   <p><squote>No. There were only five passengers. Six with the driver.
Devil of a shambles, though. Seemed to be bodies here, there and
everywhere.</squote>
   <p><squote>Anyone escape?</squote>
   <p><squote>Killed four of them,</squote> he said. <squote>Simply hadn't a chance.
But the two on the back seat threw themselves out. They're in the
I.M.H., one with a couple of broken legs. The other got away
with cuts and a bump on his head like a pigeon's egg. He's the
luckiest beggar still breathing this morning.</squote>
   <p><squote>Who is he?</squote> I asked.
   <p><squote>A friend from the hills. That's a bit of his property.</squote> Rob
pointed to the box. <squote>Tossed off the luggage grid the first time the
bus turned over. Fell in a clump of thorns and lodged there. Luckily
for us it burst at the seams, and when the sub-inspector from
Dalgoorie saw what was in it, he sent down for me.</squote>
   <p><squote>And you impounded it.</squote>
   <p><squote>I borrowed it,</squote> said Rob, <squote>and all the other personal
belongings I could find scattered on the side of the hill. Took them
into safe custody till I could discover whose they were.... As soon
as you've taken a look at that little lot, I'm having the hasp riveted
back into place and the box delivered to the I.M.H. It'll be
held in store for a certain patient and he won't be any the wiser.
When I picked it up he was flat on a stretcher, out to the wide, and
the sub-inspector's down at his bedside to give him all the flannel he
needs as soon as he begins to worry.</squote>
   <p>I turned the box around and stared at the letters stencilled on
the lid.
   <p><squote>But who the devil is he?</squote> I queried.
   <p><squote>Goanese,</squote> said Rob, handing me a clue. <squote>A thin, sallow
streak of mixed Dago and Madrassi. Waves a stick in front of that
lousy set of saxes at the Mayfair.</squote>
   <p><squote>Fernandes?</squote>
   <p><squote>Manuel Fernandes.</squote>
   <p>I knew him, of course. He was the boss of Sarwate's dance band.

<text id=LOBN12>
Sam looked away and Willie thought, he's got you, Sam, you're
afraid. You're not a Socialist now.
   <p><squote>You see,</squote> Parnell said. <squote>It shows the power of a newspaper
which has strong beliefs and acts on them and perseveres.</squote> He waved
a sheaf of letters. <squote>Congratulations pouring in.</squote>
   <p><squote>So what?</squote> Willie said. <squote>You've proved the power of dirty
propaganda. That's been done before.</squote>
   <p>Parnell came around the desk and embraced his shoulders.
<squote>Willie, when will you realize? Every newspaper makes propaganda.
You know what Beaverbrook told the Royal Commission. He owns his
newspapers for no other purpose. It may be propaganda for the left or
right, it may be for the middle way. But it's all propaganda and with
good reason.</squote> His white hand tightened on Willie's shoulder.
<squote>What you'd have is a sheet which tells the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. But what is the truth, Willie? I don't
know. I only know what I think is true. I act on it and try to show
others, like the politician on his platform and the parson in his
pulpit. You must allow me that, Willie &mdash; the freedom of holding an
opinion and expressing it with every force at my command.</squote>
   <p>Very plausible, Willie thought, except for one thing. You hold
the opinion, then make others express it. You don't allow them the
freedom which you claim as a right.
   <p><squote>I know you're a Socialist, Willie. With your background you
have to be. You've never got 1926 out of your memory. But you
mustn't take it so hard. You should learn to lose more gracefully.</squote>
   <p>Willie looked at the white hand, then at Parnell. He kept his
gaze steady until the hand fell away. Then he said: <squote>It's not the
victory, it's the means. You've done your bit towards making
journalism a shameful thing.</squote>
   <p>He turned slowly and went out. Miss Simpson raised a hand to
him, slightly and secretively, because he was her favourite. As he
raised his hand in mild answer, his thoughts said, something happened
in there just now. We moved another step nearer the inevitable, the
show-down. Parnell on one side, me on the other, and no compromise in
between.
   <p>He went up the stairs to Joe's room. The News Editor was
cleaning his pipe; pushing the white cleaner in one end and waiting
for it to come out brown at the other.
   <p><squote>Have you seen the letters?</squote> Joe said. <squote>All the
congratulations?</squote>
   <p>Willie went to the window, looking out at nothing. <squote>I could
puke.</squote>
   <p><squote>You don't want to take it personal, Willie. You and me and the
rest of us. We do what we're told. We don't make the policy.</squote>
   <p><squote>That's no answer. No excuse.</squote>
   <p>Joe dropped the cleaner into the waste-basket. He replaced the
stem in the bowl, twisting it another squeak so that the mouthpiece
became comfortable to his teeth. He took out his tobacco-pouch and
filled the bowl, fingering down a shred which curled over the edge.
Then he tapped his pockets for matches. <squote>It doesn't matter,
Willie,</squote> he said, finding them. <squote>It isn't worth the trouble.</squote>
   <p>Willie did not answer. He knew that in this room it wasn't worth
the trouble; that nothing mattered except Joe's do-nothing,
say-nothing, be-nothing. He knew that if he stayed long enough, here
in this room which this man had made, he would do nothing, say
nothing.
   <p>He went out to the corridor and along it to his room. In the
reporters' room Ritchie's voice was plain: <squote>On some newspapers
there'd be champagne to celebrate.</squote> Through the opened door of
another room he saw the sub-editors, crouched over their copy like
cold hens on a perch.
   <p>Willie opened the door which said <squote>Mr Whittaker</squote> and slumped
into his chair; biting his thumb, his thoughts boiling with anger and
disgust and humiliation. He reached for the telephone and half a
minute later her voice was there.
   <p><squote>Helen, will you eat with me, drink with me... somewhere...
anywhere?</squote>
   <p>He imagined her surprise.
   <p>She said: <squote>Why, yes, Willie, of course.</squote>
   <p><squote>We could go out in the country somewhere. One of those places
where we used to go. Before,</squote> he hesitated and added, <squote>before the
war.</squote>
   <p><squote>That would be nice.</squote>
   <p>He knew she was perplexed by the peremptory invitation, by his
sudden need of her.
   <p>He said: <squote>I want a drink, a good long drink. I've a bad taste
in my mouth.</squote>
   <p>That was the beginning.
<head>CHAPTER NINETEEN</head>
   <p>No, not the beginning, Willie thought. Our beginning is years
ago, when I thought my tie was a propeller and you were on the
outside, always looking in. Since then it's been there, like a star
in the night.
   <p>They lay in the green shade beneath trees, where the river ran
away with the sunshine and the leaves went up and down, like the
sleeping breath. He told her about Slack Lane and his boots and
Blonkin; of the great, wagging head and the yellow teeth and the
watchful cruelty. But that was not all about Blonkin. There was more
to him than hooligan boots.
   <p><squote>During the war,</squote> Willie said, <squote>Blonkin was a prisoner of the
Japanese and they thought he knew something, so they filled him with
water and held him upside down and hit him with rifle-butts while the
water fell out. At ten o'clock each day they hit him, and at half
past nine each day he was mad with waiting. Of course he didn't know
what they wanted him to tell, and though he tried to guess what they
wanted and told them all of it, his poor mind wasn't clever enough to
guess what they wanted, so they clubbed him again for trying to
deceive them. Now Blonkin is back in Slack Lane, living on medical
certificates because of what the Japs did to him, and other men say
there he goes, always boozing, living free and doing nothing. See
what happens when there's a Welfare State.</squote>
   <p>He told her of Creedy; tall and pale and intense, for ever
dependent on his wife who knew about his studs and socks and what he
had done with the tickets.
   <p><squote>I used to hate Creedy, when I was twelve and he forced me to
learn more than I believed I could learn. I used to lie awake
planning how to kill him, how I would kill him when I was a man and
big enough. All my love was for his wife. She was my first love and
when she smiled at him I was jealous, and when he bullied her I
changed the gun to a knife because it would last longer. But now I
see what he tried to do and what it cost him. Now I'm grateful for
all he tried to do and ashamed of the boy who gave him nothing in
return, not even thanks. He wrote me long letters during the war,
clever letters but excited, too, excited not about the war but about
what would happen afterwards. In Greece, the Balkans, in Arabia and
Egypt and Africa, in India and Burma and Malaya. He was always
looking ahead to what the war meant to those countries and what
freedom would mean to them.</squote>
   <p>Helen murmured: <squote>Is he a Communist?</squote> and Willie smiled as he
shook his head.
   <p><squote>Everybody these days has to be something. Conservative,
Socialist, Communist, as though you must belong to some party to have
any opinion worth calling an opinion. But Creedy doesn't belong to
any opinion. He's an individual. He thinks for himself. Sometimes
he sounds like a Communist. Sometimes like St Francis. Sometimes
like a boy lost in the dark. But to me he'll always be what he was
all those years ago. A sincere man, for ever crusading, if not
against ignorance, then for a boy from Slack Lane who sat in the back
row and made raspberry noises. I know now what I didn't realize then,
that without Creedy I'd have been in Slack Lane for ever, doing
nothing and learning to know that it was nothing. Dying by eight-hour
stints.</squote>
   <p>Then he told her of Aunt Nance and the dream; a white cottage in
the country with the wood-smoke pottering from the chimney and the
delphiniums blue. She asked questions about this cottage, probing
him, so that he told her about the logs of wood, criss-crossed in the
hearth, about the kettle-holder on its hook and the red curtains and
the low beam at the bottom of the stairs. He could not understand her
interest in this cottage, for, of course, there was no such cottage
and could never be; it was just the creation of a dream. He did not
ask why she probed for details. It was enough just to talk.
   <p>They began to go everywhere, so that people learned to say:
<squote>Hello, Willie, hello, Helen, nice to see you, Helen.</squote> He loved
to hear them linking their names in this way. The link was a form of
marriage. At the races they said it. Harry Carr said: <squote>Hello,
Willie,</squote> then touched his cap for Helen. At the theatre they said
it. Charlie Chester welcomed them to his dressing-room &mdash; <squote>Only
milk,</squote> Charlie said, <squote>I'm drinking milk</squote> &mdash; then pulled up a chair
for Helen. At the City ground they said it. Stanley Matthews said:
<squote>Always nice to see you, Willie,</squote> then gave his shy nod and smile
to Helen.
   <p>Willie was grateful to the big names; to Colin Cowdrey and Jack
Hawkins and Ted Ray. They could see how much it meant to him. And
when there were parties to celebrate a new play, new book, new
hit-song, new exhibition, Helen was there to help him through,
although he'd always said he despised parties; you paid too high a
price for the free drink.
   <p>He said: <squote>It's all right as long as I look across the room and
see you, Helen. Never mind the crap talk, the scratch-my-back talk,
the men pretending to be women and the women wishing they were men.
As soon as I see you and know you're still there, then it's all
right, Helen.</squote>
   <p>They never mentioned Parnell, but he seemed to be there; in the
back seat, his forearms on their seats, watching with amusement,
because the more they shared the more vulnerable they became.
   <p>Once Helen said: <squote>We're not married, not really married,</squote> and
slowly, reluctantly, disjointedly it came out. How it had begun by
Parnell sleeping in the dressing-room, because he came home so late
and did not wish to disturb her. Then he had put aside pretence and
slept in another room, making it plain to the girl who could not
understand. <squote>That was 1939,</squote> Helen said, <squote>the year of the war.</squote>
   <p>His glance was shocked and the car swerved. That's a long time,
the glance said.
   <p>Helen's smile still showed the hurt. <squote>It took me a long time to
realize that he didn't find me attractive any more. I made excuses.
Hundreds of excuses. I pretended not to know about the other women.
Then there was the war and the evacuees, such beautiful children, and
my letters to you and yours to me and in the end there was this,
Willie, what we have now. You and me.</squote>
   <p><squote>You could divorce him.</squote> He knew at once that she would not.
   <p><squote>Before she died Mummy wanted me to divorce him. She'd learned
to hate, she who was always so gentle, she'd learned to hate and cared
about nothing except that hate. Not the scandal, not the gossip, nor
the harm it would do to the newspaper. But I can't. The Herald
means too much for that.</squote>
   <p>He drove with sudden anger, glancing at the speedometer, then
boosting it higher. It flickered around seventy and she glanced in
alarm. He saw the alarm and let the rage go out of him. The needle
flickered down to sixty, to fifty, and the old car relaxed like a
horse when the race is done.
   <p><squote>Careful, Willie, or we'll never get there.</squote>

<text id=LOBN13>
   <p><squote>Isn't there something simpler you can do, like taking her
dancing. There are one or two restaurants out on the islands. They
look very romantic.</squote>
   <p>He took my advice. That same evening he and Elaine dressed in
their best and went out to dinner. But oddly it was not the dinner
which distracted her from her troubles but what came after. They came
back from the pension after I had gone to bed and I did not see them.
But a little after six, I woke to hear a tapping on my door and found
Steve in his pyjamas, his shoulders wrapped in a blanket.
   <p><squote>What the hell...</squote> I began, then noticed that his face was
grey. <squote>Steve, what's wrong?</squote>
   <p><quote>I don't know. I've been in the lavatory since four o'clock and
I feel as sick as a dog.</squote>
   <p><squote>It must be something you've eaten.</squote> His teeth were
chattering. <squote>Don't stand here: you'll catch a cold. Get back into
bed.</squote>
   <p>He walked back meekly to his room and got into bed. <squote>If you've
been up since four,</squote> I said, <squote>why the devil didn't you call me
sooner?</squote>
   <p><squote>I tried to but you were sound asleep.</squote>
   <p><squote>But couldn't you have tried any of the others?</squote>
   <p>He shrugged. <squote>I suppose I've known you longest.</squote>
   <p>His teeth were still chattering but his forehead, when I felt it,
was hot and clammy.
   <p>He said, <squote>I must have a temperature. I've been sitting exams
half the night that even Einstein would have flunked.</squote>
   <p>I went to the wardrobe, found another blanket and spread it on
the bed. <squote>Next time you catch the pox,</squote> I said, <squote>do it in
England. It's so much cheaper on the National Health.</squote>
   <p><squote>Next time that's what I'll do.</squote>
   <p>I tucked in the blanket. <squote>I'll go downstairs now and see if
they've something you can take. If it's not any better by
breakfast-time, we'll get a doctor.</squote>
   <p>I felt pretty useless, standing and watching but his face was
growing paler. At any moment he would vomit and I did not want to
leave him by himself. I went outside, towards the stairs, then
tumbled to what I should do. I stopped at Elaine's door, tapped on it
and went on tapping until it was opened and she stood there, her eyes
half open, in nightgown and wrap.
   <p><squote>Peter, what is it?</squote>
   <p><squote>It's Steve. He's not very well.</squote>
   <p><squote>He's not.</squote> Her eyes opened. She seemed concerned. I had
done right to wake her up. <squote>But what is it? What's the matter?</squote>
   <p><squote>I don't know. I imagine it's something he has eaten.</squote> She
tied the cord of her wrap and stepped into the corridor. <squote>It was my
idea to wake you. He wouldn't have wanted to disturb you himself.</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm glad you did. There's nothing worse than being ill away
from home.</squote>
   <p>She led the way into his room. When she laid her hand on his
forehead he opened his eyes. <squote>Hey! What are you doing here?</squote>
   <p><squote>You should have called me,</squote> she said. <squote>It wasn't
friendly.</squote>
   <p>He made a sudden gesture towards the wash-basin and understanding
quicker than me, she dashed across, lifted the bidet from its stand
and held it against his chest just in time. <squote>It must have been the
fish,</squote> she said, <squote>it's the one thing I didn't have.</squote>
   <p>From her fear of insects, I would have expected her to be
fastidious but not a scrap. She took the bidet away, wiped his face
with a towel as if she were doing these things every day, and then to
my astonishment, laid her cheek gently against his forehead. And it
wasn't done for effect; she really meant it. For she stayed with him,
sitting by the bed until he dropped off to sleep and then went out in
his car to bring back a doctor before she would think of having
breakfast.
   <p>He was ill for three days and for the whole time, she stayed near
him in the hotel, either in his room or sitting on the terrace, where
she could hear him when he called. With dark hair and haggard face,
he made an appealing patient. But because I thought of her as hard
and egotistical, I could not believe that she stayed with him simply
from affection. It is something I can't be sure of, but I think
perhaps after her disappointment she felt unwanted and to have someone
dependent on her must have consoled her a lot.
   <p>On the morning of the fifth day, I went into his room as I
usually did, soon after I had woken, to see how he was, and found
Elaine lying next to him in the bed. I don't believe they had been
making love &mdash; that, I imagine, did not happen until a day or so later.
But the fact that I stood there, wishing them good morning without
the slightest embarrassment showed how closely in those few days they
had come together.
<head>&lsqb;4&rsqb;</head>
   <p>It was the same, too, for Alison and me. We were English and,
without discussing it, had taken separate rooms; and we kept our
promise never to snog in front of the others. But that, instead of
keeping us apart, made us all the more passionate once we were alone.
   <p>We spent our time, sometimes with Max and Jill but more often
alone, swimming, or on the steamers, or wandering in Steve's car into
the hills. In the heat of the day we would come back for lunch and
afterwards I would go upstairs, sleep it off in a quick half-hour,
then creep along the corridor and tap at Alison's door; and asleep or
awake, she would hear the first tap and come to the door to let me in.
   <p>We made love in those few days many times. The heat, the wine,
Stresa itself &mdash; the beauty of it &mdash; made us both unbelievably amorous.
Perhaps because we knew each other that much better, or simply
because we had privacy and a spring mattress, we enjoyed each other
very much more. With regular oats and mounds of spaghetti, I put on
weight. I became bronzed, almost handsome. And the same process
turned Alison into a raving beauty, so that sometimes when we were
making love, I had to close my eyes and keep from looking at her, in
case I became too roused and satisfied myself before her. Afterwards,
while she dozed, I would lie back against the head of the bed, staring
into the twilight and feeling wonderfully calm, wonderfully rested. I
would sit there, my body cool and naked, the sheet for comfort tucked
into my crutch, stroking her cheek or her hair and listening to the
sounds, the clatter of a train, the spluttering of a scooter, that
drifted in through the closed shutters. And I'd think how right it
was, how much more moral, to live like this than like a hermit.
   <p>I was calm, contented and then for three days making love was not
possible and I found out what had happened. I still spent the siesta
in Alison's room but instead of making love, we would lie side by side
and talk. We talked a great deal in those days at Stresa, and the
more we talked, the more I liked her. She was slow sometimes to sense
the comic &mdash; her life perhaps had been too easy &mdash; but she never
pretended, she never talked for effect. I never felt with her as I
had felt with others, that I was talking to myself in a padded room.
In everything she said, was enthusiasm and a sort of passion.
   <p>For three days I went without my oats. Then, on the last night
we spent in Stresa, I went up to bed a little early while Alison went
for a shower. Because it was the last night I opened the shutters and
looked out through the trees. A faint scent came from the flowers on
Steve's balcony. The sky overhead was a mass of stars. I could see
the lights of a steamer far away on the lake and right beneath me, in
the dark beneath the trees, I could see a firefly winking to and fro
in the bushes. Then the door behind me was opened, I turned and saw
Alison. She came over to me and kissed me on the cheek. <squote>Peter,</squote>
she said, <squote>I thought I should tell you, I'm clean again and
decent.</squote>
   <p>I took her to bed and we made love. Because I hadn't expected it
and because she had come to me, I was taken unawares. In the last
moment I opened my eyes and saw her face and there it was, right in my
throat, the urge to say that I loved her. The words came to me like a
pain but I held them back. I knew even then that I'd be stupid to say
them. But afterwards when I was lying quiet, with my head on her
shoulder, I did not feel as I had felt before. I felt exposed,
unprotected, somehow afraid of what might happen.
   <p>When I woke in the morning, it was none too early and Alison had
gone already. I sat up and gave my head a damned good scratch.
Through the window, from the terrace underneath, I could hear Max and
Elaine and then Alison; so instead of lying back again for another
five, I got up and went to the window to open the shutters. I had
just begun to open the first when I saw Steve on his balcony. He was
standing quite still and well back from the balustrade so as not to be
noticed. I could see only his profile and that not very well, yet I
knew at once he was looking down at Elaine. I left the shutter as it
was and went back silently into the room. I had some idea now of what
was happening to me and I suppose because of it, I knew for certain,
without even seeing his face, that he too was on the hook.
<head>&lsqb;5&rsqb;</head>
   <p>I went down to breakfast that morning with a sort of
pre-examination shakes. The hot weather, or the wine at dinner had
given me palpitations and I felt suspicious. I had seen the world the
night before as one gigantic romance. Yet, when I joined the others,
everything, from the littered table to the look on Alison's face,
seemed horribly normal, horribly mundane.
   <p>Max was worrying, as he always did because he liked to. <squote>Venice
will be crowded. This time of year it always is. We ought to 'phone
Vittorio and ask him to book us rooms.</squote>
   <p><squote>But why bother him?</squote> Steve said. <squote>We can manage.</squote>
   <p><squote>We'll have a lot more fun if we can meet up with some of the
Venetians.</squote>
   <p><squote>Well, we can easily 'phone him when we get there,</squote> Steve
replied. <squote>There's no need to bother him now.</squote>
   <p><squote>Anyway,</squote> Jill said, <squote>we're not quite sure when we'll arrive.
It sounds from the guide book as if Verona were worth a visit.</squote>
   <p>And that was how it was left &mdash; that we didn't 'phone. But
instead of being relieved, I felt a little hurt. I should have liked
it much better if Alison had spoken up, if she had said for instance
that Vittorio was a bore.
   <p>We left Stresa shortly after breakfast and were approaching
Verona by the afternoon. Verona at first sight seemed dusty and
unremarkable. I asked Max to stop the car outside a greengrocer's and
went in to buy peaches, luscious and as big as melons. I took one of
the ripest and stood on the pavement, with Alison beside me, holding
my head well forward and letting the juice trickle over my chin. I
was wishing Bowling had been there to turn up his nose, when I noticed
Alison, looking down at a poster on the wall.
   <p><squote>The opera,</squote> she said. <squote>I forgot all about it.</squote>
   <p><squote>Opera? What opera?</squote>
   <p><squote>They have it here in the open air, in the Roman arena.
<QUOTE>

<text id=LOBN14>
<head>CHAPTER TWO</head>
   <p>HE REMEMBERED his parents talking of Maine, where they came
from, a vague and distant place girded with rocks and bound by hard
winters. Thinking back sometimes, was pleasant in a painful way, and
the sum of recollection inclined him to believe his parents had
settled the emerald meadows because they reminded them of Maine.
Small, rich fields interspersed with fingerlings of forest, along the
swift-falling curves and bends of the watershed they had called Roan's
Creek.
   <p>It was easy to recall the slab-house under trees that leaned and
creaked like antiquated gladiators when winter hurled its fierce
assaults. And the creek that flowed southward, down towards the flat
belly of prairie, and squandered its clear-water strength there. And
the crooked road wrought by his father with its fringe of shade the
full length; a narrow old snake of a road, all shade-mottled and dusty
looking, leading up out of the prairie into the blue-shaggy Beyond;
into the highland where deer and bear and all manner of game lived;
where meadows lay hidden, swollen with stirrup-high grass.
   <p>There was a great fullness to the uplands, where the land swept
back from the prairie-desert, broadening out, lifting higher and
becoming wilder in its rich fertility until it burst against the sky
in a dark and straining way.
   <p>Somehow, Ben thought, and not only because there was beauty up
there, that land had a hold on him. He'd travelled far and wide, seen
tons of country, some full of beauty and a grand solemnity that made a
man hurt for looking on it; some harsh and forbidding, some jagged and
untamed, or tilted against the flaming sunsets, or flat and docile,
but he had never seen a country that reached down inside and gripped
him like the uplands he'd known since infancy, held him now.
   <p>He belonged there. Nothing; man, animal, or element, could
turn him away. Least of all the Marlows. He arose and dressed with
these thoughts; he ate at the diner with them for company, then he
went over and bought a sturdy wagon from the liveryman, to implement
them. He also bought a team of big bay horses, a good set of harness.
Then he drove to the Deming Mercantile Company and loaded up kegs of
nails, a big grindstone, two axes and two saws, all the impedimenta of
building, all the requisites for putting down roots. And finally,
with his saddlehorse tied to the tailgate, his carbine on the seat
beside him, he took his way northward out of Deming.
   <p>Cliff Thompson lingered in the shade of the Oasis Saloon's
overhang, smoking a cigarette, and watching. When the wagon was lost
in the shimmering, heat-scourged distance, he flung the cigarette down
and stamped on it. It irritated him that Ben Roan would not see that
he was heading straight for a killing; his own or someone else's.
   <p><quote>Morning, Marshal. Wasn't that Ben Roan that drove that wagon
out of town?</quote>
   <p>Thompson bent a hard look at the lawyer. <quote>It was,</quote> he said
shortly. <quote>Why didn't you tell him to wait until there was a hearing
over that road before going up there?</quote>
   <p><quote>Someone has to bring action before there's any case,
Marshal.</quote>
   <p>Thompson looked unpleasant. <quote>Yeh,</quote> he said. <quote>I know. There
are two sides to the law &mdash; your side and my side. I get paid to
prevent trouble and you get paid for starting it. In fact, you don't
get paid unless it does start.</quote>
   <p>Charlie Bell squinted northward. <quote>Unless there's a restraining
order issued to prevent him from using that road, it's his right to
use it. He can go up there any time he wants to. You know that. So
far there's only been talk, and talk doesn't mean a thing.</quote>
   <p><quote>Law-book theory,</quote> Thompson said shortly. <quote>Did you ever try
law-book theory against a cocked pistol, Bell?</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't be ridiculous. As a matter of fact, you should be riding
up there with him. That's the only way you can prevent trouble &mdash; stop
it before it starts. If you can do that, there'll be no need for
attorneys.</quote>
   <p><quote>Now who's being ridiculous? You know damned well I can't
forbid either the Marlows or Ben Roan from fighting one another
without a court order, and by the time I get the order, the killing
has already begun. I wish folks who make laws had to carry law books
in their holsters instead of guns.</quote>
   <p>Bell continued to squint into the distance and Marshal Thompson
fell into a deep and disgusted silence. A solitary vertical groove of
disapproval lay deep between his eyebrows.
   <p>Ben drove steadily and did not look back. Deming squatted far
back in the quivering heat one moment, and the next moment it blurred
into a soiled murk low against the roll of far horizon. His thoughts
were on other things. The Marlows might have money now, good horses
and a large herd, but he knew men; that kind didn't change inwardly.
He knew from a dozen gunfights that it was what lay inside men that
counted, not their bankrolls nor their herds, nor the quality of their
stock. The Marlows had never had it, and all the money in the world
wouldn't put it into them.
   <p>They might try scaring him out; probably would. Or they might
shoot his horses, or even try to bushwhack him, but when it came to
stand-up-and-fight, or cut and run, lead bullets or fast horses, he
knew which way they'd go.
   <p>He forged steadily ahead towards the blue-shadows where the land
swelled upwards with a heavy lift and fullness. He kept a sharp watch
but made no attempt to conceal his coming by clinging to the
creek-willows or the meagre shadows. If they were watching, let them
watch. If they'd found a pinch of guttiness among them, let them show
it.
   <p>He was drinking in the beauty of the shade and the uplands' deep
silence when movement to his right, a quiver of colour, of red and
white, snagged at the corner of his vision. Facing swiftly half
around, one hand moving in a blur, he saw the horse, head up, tail
high and waving, running westward. A lemon-yellow sun, burning-huge,
cast a haziness over the distance. He watched the horse long enough
to discern flopping stirrups and broken reins, then he back-traced
with his eyes to where the sprawl of colour lay in the dead grass;
swung the team, urged them closer and kept staring at the vivid hues
until he was close enough to make out arms and legs, then he slowed,
set the brake and jumped down.
   <p>He rolled her over with one hand, straightened her limbs and
knelt there wondering who she was, where she had come from. Her
blouse was tight-rising, violent red, and her riding skirt was creamy
and expensive looking. Her face, even in unconsciousness, was square,
full-lipped, and wilful appearing, and a thick riot of auburn hair
glistened fiercely in the sunlight. He shaded her face with his hat
and waited. She was uninjured so far as he could see, except for
being knocked senseless by the fall. He twisted to look after the
horse. It had disappeared.
   <p>He was smoking and studying the upland shadows when she said,
<quote>Oh...!</quote> He punched out the cigarette, lifted her head and
smoothed away the hair.
   <p><quote>What happened, ma'm?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh... He bucked me off.</quote>
   <p>He propped her up against his knee, put his hat back on and bent
to shield her from the sun. <quote>Nothing's broken that I could find.</quote>
   <p>The girl felt the back of her head and said, <quote>Ouch!</quote>
   <p>He watched her a moment, then gripped her by both arms. <quote>Come
on; you can stand up. I'll drive you home.</quote>
   <p>She looked into his face for the first time, and her long eyes
narrowed. <quote>Who are you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ben Roan. I own some land up in the foothills.</quote>
   <p><quote>Roan...?</quote> She blinked and stared.
   <p>He nodded. <quote>And who are you, ma'm?</quote>
   <p><quote>Sarahlee Marlow.</quote>
   <p>He stared. <quote>Marlow? Kin to old Will and the others?</quote>
   <p><quote>Will is my uncle. The boys are my cousins.</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't recollect ever hearing of any other Marlows
hereabouts.</quote>
   <p><quote>My people live in Santa Fe. I've been up here since last May
looking after grandpaw. He's very old.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well,</quote> Ben said, helping her to arise. <quote>Come on; I'll drive
you on up to the Marlow place.</quote>
   <p>While he was setting the lines straight with his back to her, she
straightened her clothes, brushed herself off, and looked westerly,
after the horse, with anger in her eyes, but she said nothing. He
helped her up, went around and climbed up beside her, and flicked the
lines. The team leaned, the wagon ground back onto the road, and for
a while the only sound was of iron tyres grinding down into the gritty
dust.
   <p>Where the green bog lay the ascent began. Ben slapped with the
lines, the team leaned into their collars, and the trail steepened.
Not until they were on the level again, moving through tree-shade,
did the girl speak.
   <p><quote>What you're doing is foolish, Mr. Roan.</quote>
   <p><quote>Is it?</quote> Ben said easily, without looking around at her. <quote>It
doesn't seem that way to me.</quote> He let the lines lie slack. The team
dropped their heads and toed into the next upgrade.
   <p><quote>My cousins won't let you do it.</quote>
   <p>He turned, finally, and gazed at her. <quote>You know, ma'm. I've
heard that before. I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it
now.</quote>
   <p><quote>You have no right-of-way to the old Roan place.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ma'm, my father built this road almost thirty years ago.
Before the Marlows were in this country.</quote>
   <p><quote>But the road hasn't been used since you left.</quote>
   <p><quote>Maybe not, but whether I've got a right or not is for a
law-court to decide &mdash; not your cousins, or your uncle.</quote> Ben
shrugged slightly, studied the land ahead, then said, <quote>I can't make
old Will like the idea of my being up in here, but he might as well
get used to the idea.</quote>
   <p>She studied his profile for a moment, before she said, <quote>You're
going to make a lot of unnecessary trouble, Mr. Roan.</quote>
   <p><quote>No; I'm not going to make any trouble. All I'm going to do is
build a cabin, a barn, some corrals, and try to live in peace. If
there's trouble it won't be me that starts it.</quote> He was going to say
more when movement among the trees ahead caught his attention. The
lines lay in his left hand; the right hand was curled and moving when
a big-framed man moved out into the road in front of the team. He was
holding a carbine one-handed; it was cocked.
   <p><quote>That's far enough, Roan.</quote>
   <p>Ben recognised Harold Marlow. <quote>Hello, Hal,</quote> he said quietly.
   <p><quote>Sarahlee!</quote> The way Marlow said it, it sounded like
<squote>Sally</squote>. <quote>What'n tarnation you doing up there?</quote>
   <p><quote>That horse El gave me bucked me off.</quote>
   <p><quote>Are you hurt?</quote>
   <p><quote>No; but &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>El told you he was green-broke. It's a wonder you didn't get
hurt bad.</quote> Marlow gestured with the carbine. <quote>Get down off'n
there.</quote>
   <p><quote>Wait a minute,</quote> Ben said. <quote>She'll get down when you empty
that carbine.</quote>
   <p>The big man looked hard at Roan. <quote>Empty hell,</quote> he said.
<quote>You're not talking to Guy now. You're going to turn that caravan
around and head back out of here.</quote>
   <p><quote>Be a shame to see you kill your cousin,</quote> Ben said. <quote>Be sure
you shoot straight, Hal.</quote>
   <p><quote>Roan! Don't try it!</quote>
   <p><quote>Behind two big horses and beside a girl? Of course I'm going
to try it. The odds're in my favour.</quote>
   <p>One of the team-horses blew its nose and the girl started. Her
single ~<quote>Don't</quote> was half scream, half sob. Neither man looked
at her. The silence was tight around them all. <quote>Harold, let him
go.</quote>
   <p><quote>Can't, Sarahlee; you know that.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then wait until I get down.</quote>
   <p>Ben caught her right wrist with his left hand. He never took his
eyes off Hal. <quote>All right,</quote> he said.

<text id=LOBN15>
He kept trying for the heart when he should have gone for an
exposed wrist or arm.
   <p>His tie was flapping loose now; his hat was gone and his shoes
were dusty. His face was shiny and sweating; so was mine, no doubt.
He came in again, and as I parried I realized that he was tiring: his
point was far out of line. There's an old trick whereby you can,
theoretically, disarm a man if he'll stand still for it. I don't
suppose it was ever used in actual combat, any more than any of the
old Western gunmen ever used such fancy stunts as the highwayman's
roll or the border shift. You don't generally do juggling tricks when
your life's at stake.
   <p>But still, it was a theoretical possibility, and he was right in
position for it, and I had to do something with him that wasn't
lethal. I made a sharp counter-clockwise circle with the cane &mdash; I've
forgotten the technical name of the manoeuvre &mdash; catching that wide
point and spinning it around, twisting the weapon in his grasp...
   <p>An alert swordsman, in good condition, would simply have come
smoothly around my blade, or cane, and continued his attack; but the
little man's reflexes were slowing, his wrist was tired, and the
sudden wrench caught him by surprise, took the sword away from him,
and sent it flying across the road. He stood there for a moment,
disarmed and vulnerable, and I couldn't decide what the hell to do
with him. I guess I was a bit tired, too.
   <p>When I moved, it was a bit too late. He gave a kind of sob and
ran after his weapon. He beat me to it and picked it up and came at
me again, but he wasn't fencing any more. He had the sword in both
hands and he was wielding it like a club, beating at my head and
shoulders. He was crying with frustration and anger as he whacked
away, trying to chop me down like a tree.
   <p>It was all I could do to defend myself against the crazy attack.
I could kill him, all right &mdash; he was wide open, with his arms above
his head like that, and one straight-armed lunge would have driven the
brass-tipped cane through the cartilages of his throat &mdash; but I wasn't
supposed to kill anybody. Under no circumstances. This is an
order. This is an order. Suddenly I had too many weapons. My
hands were full; I had to get rid of something if I was going to take
him alive, although this seemed to have most of the pleasant aspects
of getting a living, spitting bobcat out of a tree.
   <p>I parried a two-handed cut with the sword that would have laid my
scalp open even if the weapon didn't have a edge  on it. I
threw my arms about the little man, dropped everything and, clutching
him desperately &mdash; if he got free now, he could run me through in an
instant &mdash; I gave him the knee just as hard and dirty as I could. When
he doubled up, I clubbed him on the back of the head, not with the
edge of the hand to break his neck, but just with the heel of my fist,
like a hammer, to drive him down into the road. He went down, and
curled up like a baby, hugging himself where it hurt.
   <p>Breathing hard, I retrieved my knife. I picked up the sword, and
the cane sheath, and fitted them back together. It was a beautiful
job of workmanship: you couldn't see the joint at all. I picked up
the Homburg hat and dusted it off, and carried it back to the little
guy, who was still lying there. My left hand ached, and I didn't feel
a bit sorry for him, although I had to admit, in all honesty, that
he'd put on a damn good show. Whether it was genuine or phony
remained to be determined. I bent over to hear what he was moaning.
I caught a name, and leaned closer.
   <p><quote>Sara,</quote> he was whimpering. <quote>I did my best, Sara. I am
sorry.</quote> Then he looked up at me. <quote>I am ready,</quote> he said more
clearly. <quote>If I were just a little bigger... But I am ready now.
Kill me, murderer, as you did her!</quote>
<head>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</head>
   <p>IT TOOK US a while to get things straightened out. When he'd
finally become reconciled to not dying heroically at my hands, the
little man told me he was Sara Lundgren's fiance, Raoul Carlsson, of
the house of Carlsson and LeClaire, women's clothing, Stockholm,
Paris, London, Rome. He'd met Sara at her dress shop in the line of
business, it seemed, and romance had flowered.
   <p>He'd been worried about his Sara lately, however. She'd seemed
preoccupied and unhappy, he said. Finally, when she stood him up for
lunch and then called up later the same day from a certain hotel to
cancel their dinner engagement for reasons that didn't ring quite
true, he'd taken it upon himself to go there and... well, to tell the
truth, he'd spied on her. For her own good, of course, not because he
was the least bit jealous. He merely wanted to know what was
troubling her so that he could help.
   <p>Watching her surreptitiously as she waited in the hotel lobby,
he'd soon realized that she, in turn, was busy watching for somebody
else. He'd seen me come through the lobby with Lou Taylor. Sara had
followed us, and he'd followed Sara. After dinner, he'd trailed us
all back to the hotel. Then Sara had got her car and driven into the
park. He'd been behind her until she stopped. She got away from him
briefly while he was looking for a suitable place to leave his own
car. When he got back to the parking lot on foot, her fancy
Volkswagen was standing there empty.
   <p>He'd waited in the bushes for her to return. He'd seen her come
back to the car with me. We'd had a long conversation not as friendly
as it might have been, he thought. I'd left abruptly, he thought in
anger, and disappeared into the darkness. Almost immediately, as if
dispatched by me, two men had come and dragged Sara out of her car and
carried her off in the direction I'd taken. While he, Carlsson, was
still trying to make his way after her through the trees and darkness,
there had been shots. He'd come to the edge of the clearing and seen
me standing there, looking grim and terrible. At my feet was his
beloved, his Sara, lying on the ground, brutally beaten and shot to
death. He'd started forward, but the police had come...
   <p><quote>Why didn't you tell them about me?</quote> I asked, when he stopped.
   <p>He shrugged his shoulders expressively. <quote>They would have put
you in prison where I could not reach you. I was crazy with grief and
anger. I was going to punish you myself, not give you to some stupid
policeman!</quote> After a moment, he went on: <quote>I slipped away. I
learned your name at the hotel. When you left, in the morning, it was
easy to determine your destination. I followed.</quote>
   <p><quote>With your little sword-cane,</quote> I said dryly.
   <p>He shrugged again. <quote>Pistols are not so common here as they are
in your country, Herr Helm. It was the only weapon I owned. I
thought it would suffice. I did not expect to meet a swordsman with
an American passport.</quote> He grimaced. <quote>You are skilful, sir, but
that little knife, I do not think that was quite fair.</quote> After a
moment, he said, <quote>You cannot tell me this secret business in which,
you say, my Sara was engaged, that led to her death? You cannot tell
me who killed her?</quote>
   <p>I said, <quote>No, but I can assure you the man will be taken care
of.</quote>
   <p>That was big talk, for someone whose hands were tied by official
orders, but I had to say something to get this little firebrand out of
my hair. The situation was complex enough without being loused up
further by vengeful amateurs. I finally got him to promise to go back
to Stockholm and leave everything to me. I took his home address and
telephone number, and promised to notify him when I had something to
notify him about. I watched him get into his big American car and
drive away. Then I got into my little Volvo, drove back to the hotel,
stuck some bandaids on my fingers, and went to bed.
   <p>In the morning, I had my breakfast in a corner of the hotel
dining room, which I shared, for the moment, only with a pair of
railroad workers and a tourist couple from Norway &mdash; the language
sounds like badly garbled Swedish, to a Swede. Outside the windows,
it was a bright, clear fall day. I hoped it would stay that way, for
photography's sake. I sipped my coffee, and nibbled at the stuff on
my plate, and thought about Mr. Raoul Carlsson, which was a waste of
time. If the little man was kidding me, I'd know more about it when
Vance made his report, I hoped within the next day or two.
   <p>A shadow fell across the table. <quote>Are you thinking deep
thoughts?</quote> Lou Taylor asked. <quote>If so, I'll go away.</quote>
   <p>I rose and helped her with her chair. She was wearing the same
rust-brown skirt and sweater as yesterday, with the same sturdy
walking shoes. She had a trench coat with her, but she'd dropped it
on a chair. As far as I'm concerned, a trench coat looks fine on Alan
Ladd, and not bad on Marlene Dietrich, but she wasn't either one.
   <p>She smiled at me across the table, and stopped smiling abruptly.
<quote>What happened to your hand?</quote>
   <p>I glanced at my bandaged fingers. <quote>I cut it,</quote> I said. <quote>I
dropped a glass and cut myself picking up the pieces.</quote>
   <p>She said dryly, <quote>I think you'd better get yourself another
girl, Matt.</quote>
   <p>I frowned. <quote>What does that mean? Are you bowing out?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, I wasn't referring to myself,</quote> she said, laughing
quickly. <quote>I mean, your night girl, the one who plays so rough. A
black eye yesterday, two cut fingers today &mdash; or did she bite you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Keep it clean, now.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, what do you do nights, to get yourself all beat up like
that, if it isn't a girl? The secret life of Matthew Helm... Helm?</quote>
she said. <quote>Is that a Swedish name?</quote>
   <p><quote>More or less,</quote> I said. <quote>It used to be fancier, but Dad
whittled it down to something even Yankees could pronounce.</quote>
   <p><quote>I thought you must have some Scandinavian blood, or you
wouldn't be sitting there eating that stuff so calmly. Fish for
breakfast, my God!</quote> She glanced at her watch. <quote>Well, we'd better
hurry; they'll be here in ten minutes. Do you think I could possibly
promote a simple cup of black coffee and some toast? Rostat
bro"d, they call it,</quote> she said. <quote>That means, literally,
roasted bread...</quote>
   <p>It was hard to figure her. If she was on the other team, she was
very good indeed. She'd have been told I knew Swedish perfectly well,
yet here she was calmly instructing me in the language of my
ancestors, as she'd taught me their system of measurement the day
before. Well, it was always nice to deal with people who knew their
business.
   <p>When the company car arrived, right on schedule, it turned out to
be a long, black, dignified-looking old Chrysler limousine complete
with one middle-aged gent in a chauffeur's cap to drive it, and one
young guy named Lindstro"m to answer our questions and keep us out of
trouble. The two men helped me load my paraphernalia aboard; then we
drove to the mine entrance, less than a mile from the hotel, and were
passed through the gate with some formality. We took a road up the
side of a mountain named Kirnnavaara &mdash; \vaara means mountain in
Finnish, Lou informed me.

   <p>The country lane was lonely. Terrified, she faced the man who
barred her way. He gripped her arm... then he suddenly turned and ran
as he heard
<head>VOICES IN THE DARK</head>
<head>A Short Story by Trevor Allen</head>
   <p>AS dusk deepened to darkness in the gloomy beechwood Sheila
shivered. Shadows on either side of the path scared her. She was out
of breath, stumbling over roots and ruts, pressing on to reach the
road before utter darkness swallowed her.
   <p>If she hadn't taken the wrong path on the common and gone miles
out of her way, she would have been home long before sunset.
   <p>Now she felt, with mounting terror, that she might never find the
road at all and have to spend the night huddled in the shelter of
bushes or a hedge.
   <p>What a fool she'd been to come on this walk alone! But she'd set
out in a temper. She was fed up, desperate to get away from everyone
for an hour or two &mdash; especially father. He'd been nagging her again.
Nothing she did ever pleased him.
   <p>He was a builder's foreman and seemed to think he could order her
about as he did his men &mdash; as if she was still a child instead of a
girl of seventeen earning her own living. When she grew her hair
beehive style because other girls were doing it, he said:
   <p><quote>Why do you have to have your hair like that? It's hideous!</quote>
   <p>When she bought her first stiletto-heeled shoes he grumbled:
   <p><quote>How can you walk on those things, wobbling at every step?
They'll ruin your feet &mdash; and the carpets, too.</quote>
   <p>He didn't like her wearing jeans. He objected to her going to
the juke-box caf&eacute; where her friends met regularly.
<head>The last straw</head>
   <p>SHE'D just bought a transistor radio set. When he saw it all
he could say was:
   <p><quote>Why on earth do you want to cart that about with you
everywhere? You've got the telly at home; isn't that enough?</quote>
   <p><quote>I like it,</quote> she had retorted, stung by this latest reproof.
<quote>And it's my own money. I can listen to what I want any time, and
it doesn't do any harm.
   <p><quote>Why must you always be getting at me, Dad? Nothing I ever do
is right!</quote>
   <p><quote>It's just a waste of money,</quote> he had persisted. <quote>You ought
to start saving now you're in a good job, as your mother and I did
when we were young.</quote>
   <p>The transistor was the last straw &mdash; over Sunday tea, too. She
had sulked, then wandered out, past the new housing estate on the
outskirts, up the road that climbed to the beechwoods and common, on
and on, furious, rebellious, thinking over and over:
   <p>If Dad doesn't stop going on at me I'll leave home and get a
room somewhere. I'd do it now if it wasn't for mother.
   <p>Mother had always tried to smooth things out, saying: <quote>She's
young, she'll learn.</quote>
   <p>But father was obstinate, domineering.
<head>Panic</head>
   <p>THAT was how, too angry to notice where she was going, she
had taken a wrong path back and got lost. But at last, with thankful
relief, she came out on to the road and saw, through a gap in the
hedge, the town lights in the valley.
   <p>It was little more than a lane between high hedges. The lights
looked a long way off. The road seemed to want to imprison her in its
funnelled gloom.
   <p>As she set off along it she heard footsteps approaching ahead of
her and crossed over to the opposite side. <quote>Good evening!</quote> said a
thick voice in the darkness, as a man came abreast of her.
   <p>Too scared to reply, she hurried on &mdash; then became aware that he
had suddenly turned and was following her.
   <p>The footsteps behind terrified her. She quickened her pace. The
man quickened his, too, and was overtaking her.
   <p>Panic seized her. She thought of the murders she'd read about &mdash;
of girls waylaid on lonely roads like this, girls missing for days,
weeks, with search parties scouring the countryside, and then, in some
hidden spot...
   <p><quote>Oh, God,</quote> she prayed, <quote>let me get home safely, let me get
home, away from this terror!</quote>
   <p>She wanted to run, but didn't want to show she was afraid, it
might make things worse.
   <p>Her tight new skirt was hampering to the knees, and she wondered
if she could run. Terror had taken the strength from her legs.
   <p>She prayed that someone would suddenly come along the lane out of
the darkness and save her. As the footsteps drew close behind her she
crossed to the other side of the road again, still frantically
hurrying, panting and palpitating with fright.
   <p>The man came alongside. She stopped, with her back to the hedge,
facing him.
   <p><quote>In a hurry, aren't you?</quote> he slurred. <quote>Thought you might
like company... like...</quote>
   <p>His breath smelt of drink. His tone was bantering, insinuating.
He towered above her, an evil shadow in the night.
   <p><quote>Please!</quote> she gasped, her heart pounding. <quote>I don't want
company. Please!</quote>
<head><squote>Someone's coming</squote></head>
   <p>SHE made to pass, but he blocked the way.
   <p><quote>A nice girl like you,</quote> he smirked, <quote>all alone. You can be a
bit friendly, can't you? I'm alone, too. Maybe we'd get on all
right. Maybe...</quote>
   <p>She tried to sidestep him. He caught her arm.
   <p><quote>A nice girl like you,</quote> he repeated.
   <p>The grip numbed her. She felt she was going to faint.
   <p>Then... dimly, distantly, voices sounded in the stillness. They
seemed to come from down the road. Two men were talking. Now the
voices sounded nearer, slightly louder, but still remote. Thank
heaven, she was no longer alone, at his mercy...
   <p><quote>Help me!</quote> she screamed. <quote>Help! Help!</quote> Then,
wrenching her arm away from him: <quote>Now you'll get what you deserve,
you beast! Someone's coming!</quote>
   <p>Startled, the man instantly released his grip and backed away
from her. She heard him running up the road, the way they had come.
   <p>Relieved, she started running in the opposite direction, towards
the lights and the town, lifting her skirt to free her knees.
   <p>Half running half walking, stumbling, she didn't slow down until
she was out of breath and the lights of the new housing estate
glimmered ahead. And now she knew whence the voices came.
   <p>Involuntarily, as the man gripped her right arm, her finger had
touched and turned the knob on top of the transistor, held by the
strap in her left hand &mdash; this had been just enough to tune in faintly
to the two men talking. Luckily he had heard them, too.
<head><squote>Waste of money!</squote></head>
   <p>IT might have been tuned to another station. It might have
been music instead of a discussion, a play, or whatever it was.
   <p>She might have turned it full on instead of faintly, so that the
voices seemed to come from a distance, down the road...
   <p>Then she hurried home to tell her father what the <quote>waste of
money</quote> had done for her on the lonely road in the dark, with no one
near to aid her.
   <p>
   <p>The menacing gunman was getting impatient as she stalled for
time. Her position seemed hopeless... then her desperate plan showed
him that...
<head>DIAMONDS ARE HARD TO GET</head>
<head>A Short Story by SHEILA BURNS</head>
   <p>CHERRY backed her car up the drive to the garage, glad to be
home. She had hated every moment of the television theatre away from
her young, adored husband.
   <p>She saw the light in his study and guessed that he was working on
a new TV play.
   <p>Closing the garage doors behind her, she was about to turn when
she felt the cold muzzle of a gun against her back.
   <p><quote>Just a minute,</quote> said a gruff voice.
   <p>Quickly it flashed through her mind that it was John's
anniversary gift the man was after. The newspapers had carried a
story about it &mdash; a diamond brooch, and her first really expensive
gift.
   <p>Perhaps the man thought she had been wearing it at the broadcast.
But it had been left at home in the tiny safe behind the picture of
Mount Everest in the sitting room.
   <p><quote>What do you want?</quote> she asked.
   <p><quote>That brooch.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm not wearing it.</quote>
<head><squote>A muffet</squote></head>
   <p><quote>WALK to the house,</quote> the man commanded, <quote>and don't look
back. Go inside and I'll follow. Is your husband asleep?</quote>
   <p><quote>He's working late,</quote> she said.
   <p><quote>Go in just as you would if I wasn't with you.</quote>
   <p>The house was empty, except for John and Bongo, the dog.
   <p>Cherry walked up the side path to the door; her fingers shivered
as she put the key in the lock.
   <p>She paused &mdash; and the gun prodded still harder in her back as the
man said: <quote>Go on.</quote>
   <p>From upstairs, John called: <quote>That you, Cherry?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, darling, I'm back.</quote>
   <p><quote>Everything OK?</quote>
   <p>This was the moment. She broke into a sweat, then said
automatically:
   <p><quote>Everything's all right.</quote>
   <p>She crossed the little hall, the man close up behind her.
   <p>Bongo was whining from the kitchen where he had been put to bed
for the night. She walked into the little sitting room where she and
John spent their happiest hours together.
   <p>Usually she didn't come into this room immediately she returned
home, and hoped that John would hear and notice it.
   <p>But nothing happened.
   <p>She had to attract his attention somehow, for she was <quote>in a
muffet.</quote> That was what they had always called getting into a jam.
As a child John had called a muddle a <quote>muffet</quote> &mdash; <quote>Miss Muffet and
the spider</quote> he had explained and laughed at her.
   <p><quote>What are you going to do?</quote> she asked the gunman.
<head>Playing for time</head>
   <p>SHE turned to face him, agony in her heart and hoping that
she would not faint. He was smaller than she expected &mdash; a little rat
of a man with close-set eyes.
   <p><quote>I want a drink,</quote> he said.
   <p>There was a bottle of beer on the sideboard. She fetched it and
held it out to him.
   <p><quote>Put it on the table, lady,</quote> he said, still pointing the gun
at her, <quote>and then tell me where the brooch is.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's in the safe.</quote>
   <p>She spoke the truth, for she thought he might already know that
John had got a home-made safe for it. A woman's magazine had used the
story as an item in the home life of celebrities.
   <p><quote>I read about the safe,</quote> the man said. <quote>Where is it?</quote>
   <p>She conquered the compelling desire to take a quick glance at the
picture of Everest, and with her first flash of spirit, said: <quote>That
is my secret.</quote>
   <p><quote>I could make you tell me. I'm here to get what I want. I live
this way.
   <p><quote>But the big breaks are too tricky for me. I want small pulls,
something that fences don't shy at, diamonds without a history behind
them, but big enough to bring in the next meal.</quote>
   <p>He rapped the gun. <quote>Open that bottle for me,</quote> he said, <quote>and
pour it out. With a head on it... that's right. Now tell me where,
lady.</quote>
   <p>She was amazed at the courage with which she said: <quote>They're
upstairs.</quote>
   <p><quote>You could get 'em for me?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>But unless I went along with you, you'd tell your husband, I
bet. If I did go with you, he'd know, anyway.</quote>
   <p><quote>I wonder.</quote>
   <p>The man drank the beer, held out the glass for more, and for a
second she faltered. She had got to think of some way out; the longer
she lingered, the easier it could be, for sooner or later John would
realize that something was wrong.
   <p>Closely the man eyed her.
   <p><quote>If you don't get it for me, lady, maybe I'll go right up and
shoot your husband. I could.</quote>
   <p>She winced. <quote>Surely we could settle this between us,</quote> she
said suddenly.
   <p>It would be easier to give the man the brooch, but somehow she
still had a hope of not doing that.
   <p><quote>You've got to get it for me,</quote> the man said between his teeth.
<head>Terrified</head>
   <p>THEN she heard John's sudden footstep overhead and wondered
if at last he realized that something was wrong.

<text id=LOBN17>
<head>It Happened On The 6-15</head>
   <p>JOYCE SEATON was quarrelling with Barry West again. Barry
had brought her more happiness than she had ever known was possible,
and in her quieter moments she never had the slightest doubt she loved
him.
   <p>But lately they'd been quarrelling far too often. She had never
quarrelled with anyone more fiercely than she did with Barry and it
was always about the same thing &mdash; whether she should give up her job
and get married.
   <p><quote>Why can't you understand?</quote> she said despairingly. <quote>It's
more to me than just a job. It's true I've only been a secretary for
a few weeks, but it's what I've dreamed and worked for since I started
work. I'm not just an ordinary typist any more, I'm someone
important.</quote>
   <p>Barry's face set in the obstinate lines she had learned to
recognise.
   <p><quote>I know. At last you've got the chance to order other people
about and you get a kick out of it. It's making you hard, Joyce. If
you really meant what you said about loving me and wanting to marry
me &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Seeing the wistful look on his face, Joyce began to regret all
she'd said.
   <p><quote>I did mean it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then why don't you agree to be properly engaged?</quote>
   <p>Joyce drew a deep breath, determined to remain calm and
reasonable.
   <p><quote>I thought I'd explained how I feel. If I go around flashing an
engagement ring it'll look as though my mind was on something else
instead of my work.
   <p><quote>We neither of us go out with anyone else, do we? What
difference would an engagement make?</quote>
   <p>Barry was quiet now, quiet and in deadly earnest.
   <p><quote>It would mean that you really had made up your mind that your
future lay with me. We could fix a date for our wedding and I could
look forward to having you beside me all the time, instead of seeing
you for an hour or less every night.
   <p><quote>You wouldn't have to catch this darn train each day, getting
home too tired to do anything.</quote>
   <p>He gazed at her earnestly.
   <p><quote>It's putting years on you, travelling to Marbury every day.
You ought to take a look at yourself. You look much more tired since
you took on that new job. Oh, I suppose you've a bit more money to
spend on clothes and make-up, but &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>That's enough!</quote> said Joyce sharply.
   <p>Barry had really touched her on the raw, telling her she looked
older. She knew in her heart that the responsibility of her new job,
the hectic day that never seemed long enough, was telling on her. But
she wouldn't admit it for worlds.
   <p>Joyce stood up and took down her shopping bag from the rack.
   <p><quote>I think I'd better find another compartment,</quote> she said. <quote>I
was quite pleased when you came to Marbury to travel home with me. I
didn't realise you'd come to give me a lecture about the way I run my
life.
   <p><quote>Let me tell you, Barry West, that marriage isn't the only thing
a girl thinks about these days. She can make a career for herself,
lead a busy, useful life. That's what I'm doing, and I love it. In
fact, I may never marry.</quote>
   <p><quote>Now look here, Joyce &mdash;</quote> he said indignantly.
   <p>
   <p>SHE brushed past him and, stepping out into the corridor,
closed the door behind her with a slam. She was always
quick-tempered, and now tears of vexation blinded her eyes. She
hesitated in the corridor, and the chill draught that swept along it
calmed her a little.
   <p>Of course she would marry Barry one day, but she was in no hurry
to bury herself in a small house in Wilford.
   <p>Barry really knew her, though. She loved the importance of her
new job, the sense of urgency, having people doing as she asked &mdash;
having extra money in her purse for new clothes, even for silly things
like bits of costume jewellery or a new lipstick.
   <p>She shivered again. She mustn't stand here and catch cold, she
told herself.
   <p>Joyce hadn't expected Barry to follow her, for she knew he was as
obstinate as herself. It would look like a sign of weakness if she
turned back and walked past his window.
   <p>There was only one compartment between where she had been sitting
with Barry and the end of the coach, so she opened the door and took a
corner seat.
   <p>After a second or so, her indignation subsided and she felt calm
enough to take stock of her fellow-travellers.
   <p>There was a man sitting opposite her holding a sporting paper in
front of his face. Joyce didn't like what she saw of him, the long
legs in narrow trousers and the shoes with pointed toes.
   <p>The man lowered his paper to look at her and Joyce quickly
glanced away, but not before her dislike of the stranger had been
confirmed.
   <p>He was older than she expected, about thirty, and his eyes were
black and unusually searching. The thin mouth had an equally thin
moustache above it. He might be harmless enough, but Joyce was
relieved they were not alone in the compartment.
   <p>There were two men sitting facing each other at the far end of
the compartment.
   <p>They'd been chatting together, but as Joyce glanced at them, they
both turned their heads and stared back.
   <p>She closed her eyes, suddenly sick and more than a little scared.
The look in their eyes had been one of pure hate.
   <p>Joyce took another look at the man facing her, but he had raised
his paper again. She was sure she had just imagined the strange look.
Tonight, she was even more tired than usual. But, despite her
assurances, there was still a nagging little fear in her heart.
   <p>I'll move farther up the train, she decided. Perhaps I can find
an empty compartment.
   <p>She rose, took her bag, and went out. She turned the corner and
came across the door to the next coach, which the guard was locking.
He turned towards her, a grey-haired, elderly man with a kindly face.
   <p><quote>You can't go through here, miss,</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>Why not?</quote> said Joyce. <quote>There's plenty of room at the front
of the train. I thought I might find a compartment where I could put
my feet up.</quote>
   <p>The guard smiled at her but put away his keys.
   <p><quote>You can't get through, miss,</quote> he insisted. <quote>This is the
mail-coach and there is only the sorter inside. I have to lock this
door everytime I pass through myself. Come along and I'll find you a
seat.</quote>
   <p>He was polite but firm as he led her away. He opened the first
door he came to, the compartment with the three men inside. There was
nothing else for Joyce to do but step inside and sit down in her
corner again.
   <p>The man across from her was still holding up his paper, and the
other two men were leaning back. One of them looked as though he was
asleep.
   <p>
   <p>JOYCE closed her eyes and tried to sleep herself, but an
unusual inner excitement possessed her, and the noise of the train as
it pounded through the night seemed louder than usual. She gave up
the attempt to sleep and watched the empty corridor.
   <p>The guard passed by towards the mail-van again, jingling his
keys. The man across from Joyce tossed his paper aside and rose,
stumbling over her feet.
   <p>He didn't apologise. He opened the door with a curious intentness
and followed the guard along the corridor and out of sight. He won't
get far, Joyce thought. The guard will turn him back at the mail-van
door.
   <p>The man was away longer than she expected, and when he opened the
door again, he was breathing quickly. He stood in the doorway,
looking past Joyce to the other men, although previously there had
been no sign that they knew each other.
   <p><quote>Right,</quote> said the man at the door. <quote>Let's get going.</quote>
   <p><quote>Sit down,</quote> said one of the thickset men quietly. He looked
at his watch. <quote>We've got another three minutes.</quote>
   <p>Through her lashes Joyce watched the man with the pointed shoes
sit down tensely on the edge of his seat. She knew now that something
was really wrong. She kept very still, her head tilted back as though
sleeping.
   <p>Fear had her in its grip, for she knew now that she'd been right
the first time. Those men had resented her arriving in the carriage
and upsetting their plans. Three silent men, tense and waiting, and
the mail-van directly in front of them.
   <p>What had happened to that kindly guard when the man with the
pointed shoes had followed him? Why was he anxious for action? And
why had the other man held him back with a curt command?
   <p>Joyce felt that she knew the reason. Later, as the train drew
nearer to Wilford, it would slow down for the long climb up Shirley
Rise. That was where these three men intended to leave it, after they
had robbed the mail-van.
   <p>I must tell someone, thought Joyce desperately. I must be calm
and keep these men from guessing that I suspect anything. I'll leave
the compartment quietly and unhurriedly and go for help.
   <p>She thought of Barry, sitting unsuspectingly beyond that wall
only a few yards from her. She felt nervous and shaky, but willed
herself to be natural and composed.
   <p>She shook herself, opened her eyes and put up her hand as if to
stifle a yawn, when she stood up, took her bag from the rack and
turned towards the door.
   <p>The man with the pointed shoes stood with his back to it, his
beady, close-set eyes fixed on her.
   <p><quote>Not now, sister,</quote> he said softly.
   <p>For a moment, Joyce felt her mouth go dry, but she answered him
indignantly.
   <p><quote>What do you mean &mdash; not now?</quote>
   <p>He held his closed hand up before her, clenching something within
his fist. His thumb moved, and she heard a sharp click. She found
herself staring glassily at a knife-blade, only inches away from her
face.
   <p>Joyce turned and found that the other two men had risen and
closed in on her from behind.
   <p><quote>You're coming with us, girlie,</quote> he said. <quote>We didn't want
you, but it seems we've got to take you along.</quote>
   <p>Joyce opened her mouth to scream, but he was gripping her arm,
digging his fingers into her flesh. He thrust his face close to her
own.
   <p><quote>If you make a sound you'll regret it,</quote> he said menacingly.
   <p>He broke off, and Joyce's gaze shifted fearfully, looking
anywhere except into that cruel, fleshy face. The man with the knife
moved it sideways significantly, as if drawing it across her throat.
She wilted, and they moved on.
   <p>
   <p>THE man with the knife stepped out first, and Joyce was
pushed out behind him. She was hustled round to the door of the
mail-van.
   <p>Now there was a sense of urgency about the three men. Joyce was
pushed roughly aside and she saw the man with the knife had the
railway guard's keys in his hands.

   <p>He opened the door and at first she saw nothing but fat,
disordered mail-sacks, with another closed door beyond where she
guessed the sorter was at work.
   <p>One of the men kicked a sack aside as he entered and she saw
something else &mdash; a pair of feet jutting out from behind the bags &mdash; the
guard.
   <p><quote>Where's the registered stuff?</quote> said one of the men.
   <p>The man with the keys jerked his thumb towards the closed door.
   <p><quote>In there, with the sorter.</quote>
   <p><quote>All right. Open up.</quote>
   <p>One man was guarding Joyce closely. She kept trying to tell
herself that this wasn't really happening. That she wasn't involved
in violence and robbery.
   <p>The inner door was unlocked and flung open. A man in
shirt-sleeves, working at a sorting rack, turned to stare.
   <p><quote>Look out!</quote> Joyce cried.
   <p>A hand clamped over her mouth. She was jerked backwards so
painfully that her spine was jarred.

<text id=LOBN18>
   <p>SHE HAD TO DECIDE QUICKLY WHICH MAN TO TRUST &mdash; AND SHE CHOSE
THE WRONG ONE!
<head>THE NIGHT SHE CAUGHT THE LAST TRAIN HOME</head>
   <p>SHEILA FARRELL, waiting for the last train home, wasn't
happy about the way the Teddy boy kept eyeing her. After the past
hectic hours at her girl friend's twenty-first birthday party, she
felt as flat as a deflated balloon. She wished that the train would
hurry up.
   <p>The Teddy boy glanced at the station clock.
   <p><quote>Train's late,</quote> he said.
   <p>Sheila was about to answer automatically when she realised what
she was doing. She turned her head away uneasily.
   <p>The stranger wasn't put off. He tried again, sliding along the
seat towards her.
   <p><quote>Going far? I'm for Pulfern Green, myself.</quote>
   <p>He hesitated, then plunged on. <quote>Don't I know you? I'm sure
I've seen you before. Do you get this train often?</quote>
   <p>What a corny line, Sheila thought, her heart thumping.
   <p>A quick glance round told her that they might as well have been
the only two people in the world. There wasn't another soul to be
seen, not even a porter.
   <p>Would the Teddy boy follow her when she got on the train?
   <p>Sheila gave him a cold stare, rose to her feet and moved along
the deserted platform, feeling lonely and afraid.
   <p>Oh, how she wished she could have stayed the night at her
friend's!
   <p>If it hadn't been her dad's week for night shift, her mum
wouldn't have minded. As it was, Mum couldn't stand being alone in
the house at night, and Sheila had promised that she'd catch the last
train.
   <p>The approaching train made her jump nervously, although it was a
relief to hear it.
   <p>It drew noisily to a halt. Sheila entered an empty carriage and
moved down the aisle towards its far end.
   <p>She settled herself in a dark corner, every nerve strained,
listening intently. It wasn't until the train pulled out and she felt
certain that nobody had entered the carriage, that she relaxed.
   <p>She yawned, slipped off her shoes and, stretching out her legs,
lay full-length along the seat.
   <p>
   <p>BY the time the train had pulled into the next station,
Sheila was in a half doze.
   <p>She was shocked awake, nerves leaping, at the sound of a carriage
door being opened nearby. She lay still, waiting, her hands gripping
her handbag.
   <p>She could see the emergency chain just above her head and hoped
that she wouldn't have to use it. When she heard several men's voices
she felt relieved, and relaxed again.
   <p>A gruff voice rose from the next compartment.
   <p><quote>No, there ain't nobody in this carriage. I looked as it
pulled up. You don't get a lot of people travellin' at this time o'
night. That's why I thought it 'ud be safer.
   <p><quote>We've got to get to the Green tonight or else... Them rozzers
is gettin' too hot for comfort. We'll have to lay low, or it's
curtains for us, mate!</quote>
   <p>Sheila shivered. Had she jumped out of the frying pan into the
fire?
   <p>A different voice, younger and nervous, began:
   <p><quote>What if the ticket bloke remembers us? 'Ow do you know 'e
ain't ringing the rozzers right now? We'll likely be met by...</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, stop your whinin'!</quote> interrupted the gruff voice. <quote>We'll
be met all right. Fred's meeting us with 'is car. There won't be any
trouble unless you lose yer 'ead...</quote>
   <p>The voice dropped menacingly.
   <p>Sheila's hazel eyes widened. She drew back into the corner,
trying to make herself as small as possible.
   <p>She listened to every movement that the men made, all her nerves
alert. The slightest sign that they were coming her way and she would
have to pretend to be asleep.
   <p>As the train drew into another station, she realised, with
thankfulness, that the next one was hers.
   <p>She listened unwillingly, as Gruff Voice continued the
conversation.
   <p><quote>See what I mean? Nobody there, either. The train's deserted
at this time of night.
   <p><quote>Len and Busk got away. They're making for the north. If they
get picked up, they won't grass. They know better than that.</quote>
   <p><quote>What about Fred? D'ye think he's safe?</quote>
   <p><quote>Fred?</quote> scoffed the gruff voice. <quote>As safe as houses. If we
make it worth his while, we can stop there for a week or so, then move
on down to the coast.
   <p><quote>Those blokes at the bank don't know what hit 'em. They'll
never be able to recognise us. What are ye gonna do with your
lolly?</quote>
   <p><quote>Buy a car. Get some fun before it runs out. I like blondes
best. Saw a smasher the other day. She wouldn't look at the likes of
me, though, unless I'd plenty of lolly to spend on her.</quote>
   <p><quote>You and your blondes!</quote>
   <p>A coarse laugh drowned the other's reply, and sent shivers down
Sheila's back.
   <p>Surely they were nearly at her station by now? How was she going
to get out so that the men wouldn't realise she'd heard them?
   <p>She knew just how dangerous her position was. That gruff voice
had no mercy in it.
   <p>
   <p>WITH mixed feelings of relief, Sheila saw the lights of her
station come into view. Very gently she slid out of her seat and
round to the carriage door. She eased back the catch and held it
steady as the train pulled up.
   <p>She got out, and was beginning to close the door when she saw
that the next one was opening, and a man's startled face was gazing at
her.
   <p>In mounting panic, Sheila turned and fled down the deserted
platform. Thudding feet started after her.
   <p>She raced for the exit, her mind searching desperately for a way
of escape. She'd got to get to the police, somehow.
   <p>There was no sign of a porter. Instead, a well-dressed,
dependable-looking man stood near the exit.
   <p>Sheila made up her mind quickly.
   <p><quote>Please, please help me!</quote> she said urgently. <quote>I've just
overheard two crooks on the train, and I must get to the police. I'm
sure they know I've overheard them, and they're coming after me.</quote>
   <p>The stranger looked at Sheila oddly for a moment, hesitated as
though making up his mind, then propelled her out of the exit towards
a waiting car.
   <p>As he did, the two men burst out into the quiet street and
pounded up to them. The stranger stood quietly, waiting for them.
   <p>Then it dawned on Sheila who he was.
   <p><quote>Fred!</quote> she gasped in horror.
   <p>As Sheila tried to dodge past them, her heel caught in the
pavement and she stumbled forward.
   <p>She managed one cry for help before a hand closed over her mouth.
   <p>A voice snarled in her ear, <quote>Keep still, or else...</quote>
   <p>Sheila was bundled into the car. There she sat, squashed between
the two men, heart pounding wildly with fear.
   <p>The younger man looked her over admiringly.
   <p>Sheila shivered.
   <p><quote>OK, Fred,</quote> said the burly man. <quote>Take it away.</quote>
   <p>Sheila stared at the silent man's back. She'd picked the wrong
man. But how could you tell which man to trust and which to avoid?
   <p>She'd gone for the nice face and clothes and she'd been
hopelessly wrong. First the Teddy boy... the Teddy boy! He'd had a
nice voice behind all that talk-gimmick. But she hadn't given him a
chance after the first sight of his clothes.
   <p>Suddenly, there came a gleam of hope. He'd said that he was
going to Pulfern Green, her station. Had he got off here? Could he
have seen anything? Would he act on it if he had?
   <p>Sheila looked back as the car turned out of the street, but saw
no one.
   <p>Nobody spoke. At last, Sheila could stand it no longer.
   <p><quote>Where are you taking me?</quote> she burst out. <quote>What are you
going to do with me? Please let me go. I won't say a word, I promise
you. My mother's waiting for me, and she's alone and she'll be so
upset. Please let me go!</quote>
   <p><quote>Well now, ain't that a pity? Her mummy's waiting up for
her.</quote>
   <p>Gruff Voice grinned nastily, then his voice altered cruelly.
   <p><quote>You got yourself into this &mdash; nobody asked you to listen to our
talk. You've heard enough to get us put away, so you've got to be put
in a safe place. See?</quote>
   <p>With the last word, he took her wrist and gave it a quick twist,
making her gasp.
   <p><quote>That's just a little taste of what you'll get if you try
anything on, see?</quote>
   <p>Sheila nodded, eyes blinking back the threatening tears, as she
nursed her sore wrist.
   <p>
   <p>THE car drew up beside a large, detached house. Sheila was
bundled out, propelled along a passage, and pushed into a room.
   <p><quote>Yer stay there till we decide what to do with you!</quote> Gruff
Voice growled. <quote>And make no mistakes &mdash; if I hears a peep out of you,
you're for it!</quote>
   <p>Then the key was turned in the lock and Sheila was alone.
   <p>She gave way to tears of hopelessness.
   <p>As the tears relieved her immediate tension, Sheila realised
everything had gone quiet in the house. She supposed that they were
having a meal &mdash; they certainly weren't bothering about her.
   <p>As she sat there, she was suddenly aware of a tapping at the
window. She went over.
   <p><quote>Who is it?</quote> she said nervously. <quote>Who &mdash; who's there?</quote>
   <p>She could only just make out the whispered reply, but it filled
her with unbelievable hope.
   <p>The voice said:
   <p><quote>Have you been kidnapped?</quote>
   <p>At her answer the unknown voice went on:
   <p><quote>I was the chap who spoke to you at the main-line station, but
you wouldn't have anything to do with me, remember? I saw you being
pushed into that car. You didn't look as if you went willingly, so I
followed on my motor bike. Thought I'd better find out for sure
whether you needed help, before I went for the police.
   <p><quote>I came round the back of the house wondering which room you
were in, when I &mdash; I heard you cry.
   <p><quote>I'm going for the cops now,</quote> the voice went on. <quote>You won't
be there much longer, if I can help it. Keep your chin up! Be seeing
you.</quote>
   <p>Sheila found herself shaking, without really knowing why.
   <p>Rather than lose all control, she turned her thoughts to the
young man who was proving such a friend in need.
   <p>What a nice person he must be to help her after the way she had
treated him at the station!
   <p>
   <p>THEN at last Sheila heard the sound of a car outside. The
sudden shrilling of the doorbell made her jump.
   <p>Presently, she heard the footsteps of the men as they clattered
downstairs.
   <p>They held a whispered conversation outside her door, then the key
turned in the lock and Gruff Voice and his accomplice entered.
   <p>The younger man was plainly scared, and the older man was cursing
under his breath.
   <p>Sheila backed away from them and managed one scream before a
scarf was thrust round her mouth.
   <p>They heard the front door being opened and Fred's voice asked,
<quote>Yes? What is it? You've got me out of bed!</quote>
   <p>Sheila's pulses leaped as she recognised the Teddy boy's voice.
   <p><quote>Excuse me, but does Mr. Smith live here?</quote>
   <p>What on earth was he playing at? Did he think he could rescue
her alone?
   <p>Fred's innocently outraged voice began, <quote>No, he doesn't!
What's the big idea...</quote>
   <p>Then came a sudden crash as the front door was thrust violently
open, and several deeper voices sounded.
   <p>The gripping hands around Sheila tightened until she could barely
breathe. As the door gave way before a brawny shoulder, she was
thrown into a struggling mass of bodies.
   <p>A fist aimed at somebody else caught her a glancing blow on the
side of the head, and she fell backwards. Another pair of hands
caught hold of her and began pulling her away from the fighting men.
   <p>She struggled weakly until a remembered voice spoke urgently to
her.
   <p><quote>Don't struggle! It's all right, now. I've brought the police
and it will soon be over.</quote>

<head>A Present For General Calinga</head>
   <p>HE WAS BETRAYED &mdash; BY THE ONE MAN WHOSE LOYALTY HE HAD ALWAYS
TAKEN FOR GRANTED
   <p>
   <p>THE President continued holding the telephone to his ear
long after he knew beyond all doubt that the line had been cut. Then
he gave a despairing little sigh, returned the now useless instrument
to its cradle and sat staring with unseeing eyes at the wall opposite.
   <p>A sudden outburst of machine-gun fire from outside the Palace
caused him to shiver and rise from his chair. He began to walk
quickly towards the door. But as he reached out to turn the handle
the door opened and his aide, Major Pillar Juarez, entered.
   <p>Juarez was a young man of the slim athletic type. Unlike most of
the Air Force pilots his uniform was always immaculate, a fact which
had commended itself to the President when he had first considered
making him his personal aide.
   <p>But now the major's uniform had lost its immaculate look; it was
dusty and his right trouser leg had a large tear in it.
   <p><quote>Excellency,</quote> he said quietly before the President could
speak, <quote>you will have to leave. The rebels are closing in and the
troops we have here cannot hold out much longer. Santos has made the
Palace &mdash; and you &mdash; his main objective. He is concentrating his forces
here because once you are in his power, well, it's all over.</quote>
   <p>The President swallowed. <quote>Did you know the telephone line is
cut? Our position is hopeless.</quote>
   <p><quote>That is why you must leave here, Excellency. I have the
helicopter standing by and I'll take you down to La Plomas. General
Calinga has the city completely under control. We'll fight back from
there, Excellency. Yes, with General Calinga behind you &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't know.</quote> The President's words broke in almost
nervously. <quote>About Calinga, I mean.</quote> He shook his head. <quote>No, I'm
not at all sure of him.</quote>
   <p><quote>But Calinga is loyal to you, Excellency.</quote>
   <p><quote>Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.</quote> The President half closed his
eyes, <quote>I've had my fill of bitter disappointments since this
uprising, Juarez. So many people I'd trusted have turned against
me.</quote> He lit himself a cigarette with a jerky movement. <quote>You,
Juarez,</quote> he added, <quote>are about the only one whose loyalty I can take
for granted.</quote>
   <p><quote>You trust me implicitly, Excellency?</quote> The words came
quickly, almost sharply.
   <p><quote>I do, Juarez.</quote>
   <p><quote>But you are not absolutely certain of Calinga's loyalty?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not quite. His loyalty will depend on which way the wind is
blowing. And at present &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>So, should Calinga have decided to throw in his lot with the
rebels and I take you to La Plomas, well, I shall in effect be handing
you over to Santos?</quote> The major's words were more a statement of
fact than a question.
   <p>The President drew heavily on his cigarette. He nodded slowly at
it.
   <p><quote>So therefore you won't come with me?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p>Major Pillar Juarez slowly undid the flap of his holster. He
withdrew his revolver. He pointed it straight at the President.
   <p><quote>The helicopter is all ready,</quote> he said quietly and evenly.
<quote>You will fly to La Plomas in it.</quote>
   <p>The President stared. <quote>Juarez,</quote> he said huskily, <quote>you seem
particularly anxious to take me to Calinga. Suspiciously anxious, I
would say.</quote>
   <p>Juarez tightened his grip on the gun. <quote>You said you trusted
me.</quote>
   <p>The President nodded. <quote>I did. And I meant it. At the time.</quote>
He paused. <quote>Now I'm not so sure. I &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>All right,</quote> cut in Juarez sharply, <quote>my crew-men are already
aboard.</quote> He made a little movement with the revolver. <quote>Come,
we'll go now.</quote>
   <p>As Juarez opened the door the President suddenly started biting
at his lower lip. <quote>The helicopter,</quote> continued Juarez, <quote>is
standing in the interior gardens.</quote> The President walked slowly out
of the room; his eyes were now blinking spasmodically.
   <p>
   <p><quote>WAS it necessary to tie me up like this?</quote> The
President looked tired and old as he indicated his bound wrists.
   <p>Juarez did not answer. He turned to his radio-operator. <quote>I'm
dropping to a thousand feet,</quote> he said. <quote>Try to contact Santos
now.</quote>
   <p>The President's eyes filled with an ocean of contempt. <quote>And to
think I once gave you my trust,</quote> he choked. <quote>Much rather had I
stayed at my Palace and &mdash;</quote> He suddenly leaned forward and buried
his face in his bound hands. He started sobbing silently to himself.
   <p>For a moment Juarez contemplated the broken man beside him. He
opened his mouth to say something but as he did so his radio-operator
announced that he had contacted Santos. Juarez nodded. He took his
microphone and started talking slowly, deliberately.
   <p>After he had finished doing so he dropped the helicopter to five
hundred feet. He banked slightly. When he saw three men leave a hut
and walk out towards the middle of the field in front of it he dropped
even lower.
   <p><quote>That's Santos,</quote> pointed the radio-operator. <quote>The one in the
middle.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I know.</quote> Juarez made towards the group. He landed the
helicopter about fifty yards away from the three men. He kept the
rotor blades turning. <quote>Right,</quote> he said sharply to the President,
<quote>out you get. Santos is expecting you!</quote> He removed his gun from
its holster.
   <p>The President lifted his head. He glanced at the revolver and
also at the carbines the radio-operator and Juarez's other crew-men
were holding. His eyes started blinking again. Then slowly he rose
from his seat. He followed Juarez out of the machine like a man from
whose body the last spark of life had all but departed.
   <p>
   <p>SANTOS could not contain himself any longer: when he saw
his dejected enemy before him he started running towards the
helicopter. He was shouting almost incoherently.
   <p>It was then that the carbines opened up catching Santos's two
henchmen completely unawares; they died instantly. At the same moment
Juarez moved forward to the rebel leader. He put his gun close to the
other's stomach. He pulled the trigger five times.
   <p>Now the two crew-men had dropped their carbines. They leaped out
of the helicopter and unceremoniously tossed the dazed and bewildered
President back into it. Then, while Juarez climbed frantically for
the pilot's seat, they also tossed aboard the dead body of the rebel
leader.
   <p>As the helicopter began to rise they regained their carbines and
poured a stream of bullets at the shouting groups of men who were now
running out towards the field.
   <p>At two thousand feet Juarez set course for La Plomas. He smiled
tightly as his radio-operator leaned over and cut the bonds on the
President's wrists. <quote>Well, Excellency,</quote> he said, <quote>it was a long
shot but &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>It was indeed a long shot,</quote> interjected the President in a
strangled voice. <quote>A very long shot.</quote> He swallowed. <quote>But I am
still bewildered. Why was it necessary to force me into this
helicopter at gunpoint? And why the bonds? Why &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Excellency,</quote> said Major Pillar Juarez, <quote>I had to force you
into the helicopter because otherwise you would have stayed at your
Palace. And died. Also, with the greatest respect, Excellency, you
are a very poor actor; you cannot hide or disguise your emotions. So
I had to make you actually believe I was handing you over to
Santos.
   <p><quote>No, Excellency, you could not have played the part you did; it
had to be, as far as you were concerned, only too horribly true.
Otherwise it could not have succeeded. You did believe it &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. And I believed that you too had turned against me,
Juarez.</quote> The words were uttered as an apology as humble as it was
sincere.
   <p>Juarez smiled. <quote>Yes, you had to believe that too,
Excellency.</quote> He altered course ten degrees to starboard. <quote>La
Plomas ahead,</quote> he announced. <quote>Now when we land and you show
General Calinga the dead body of the rebel Santos, there is no doubt
where his loyalty will be, is there?</quote>
   <p>The President nodded and fell silent. About a minute later he
said: <quote>Juarez, I can never reward you enough. I &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Excellency,</quote> smiled Major Pillar Juarez, <quote>I have a wish I
hope you will grant.</quote>
   <p><quote>Name it.</quote>
   <p>The major's smile widened. <quote>A new uniform, Excellency.
Hand-tailored in English cloth.</quote> He glanced at the tear in his
trouser leg. <quote>I think I am almost entitled to that, Excellency.</quote>
   <p>The President laughed. It was the first time he had done so in
over three weeks. It was a long laugh. A slightly hysterical laugh.
<head>THE FRIEND</head>
   <p>SANTAGO WAS A MAN TO BE TRUSTED... HE COULD USE A SUB-MACHINE
GUN
   <p>
   <p>CAPTAIN RAMON CORDORA'S voice was loud. <quote>Corporal
Santago,</quote> he shouted. <quote>Where's Corporal Santago?</quote>
   <p>One of the privates looked up briefly from his cards. <quote>Back
there somewhere,</quote> he grunted.
   <p>Cordora opened his mouth again as if he were going to remonstrate
with the private for his appalling lack of discipline but, thinking
better of it, he moved off in search of Santago.
   <p>He found him behind the hut cleaning his rifle. <quote>Well,
Corporal,</quote> he smiled, <quote>I'm glad to see someone in your platoon
cleans his weapons regularly!</quote>
   <p>Santago did not answer until he had removed the piece of
four-by-two from his pull-through. <quote>I always used to clean my rifle
regularly.</quote> His voice was surly. <quote>If you made an inspection now
and then, you'd know that I still do.</quote>
   <p>Cordora continued smiling. <quote>Now, now, can't you take a little
joke, my friend?</quote>
   <p>Santago slowly raised his head. <quote>Don't you call me your
friend,</quote> he said. <quote>The only friend you have is yourself.</quote>
   <p>The other's smile remained fixed. <quote>We were friends once upon a
time.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, but that was long, long ago.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not so long ago.</quote> The Captain paused. <quote>It's only six
months since we were serving together under La Cruz.</quote>
   <p>Santago now began to examine the bolt of his rifle. <quote>Yes,</quote> he
murmured, <quote>we served together under him. As privates. Then along
came Kassan. And with him in power what happened? You became
sergeant the very next day.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> broke in Cordora, <quote>but shortly after that I was able
to get you promoted to corporal.</quote>
   <p>Santago lifted his head. <quote>True. But you also got yourself
promoted to lieutenant. Then a month later you became a captain.</quote>
He bent down once again and started cleaning his rifle bolt. <quote>Yes,
you were a good friend to yourself. But not to me. Any friend of
mine would have made sure I got a bit higher than this.</quote>
   <p>His eyes flicked contemptuously to the rank badges on his right
sleeve, then back again to his rifle bolt.
   <p>Cordora switched his smile off and managed to look sympathetic.
<quote>I know how you must feel,</quote> he said. <quote>But it's not so easy as
you'd think. I did my best for you but President Kassan has never
forgotten that day over two years ago, when you let him have the butt
of your rifle right across his face.</quote>
   <p><quote>I couldn't help it,</quote> muttered the other. <quote>I was ordered to
disperse the crowd and I was only doing my duty. How was I to know
that one day he'd be President?</quote>
   <p>Captain Cordora made a little clicking sound with his teeth.
<quote>Well, nevertheless, he's never forgotten it. And every time I've
brought up the subject of your commission, well, he has said no. In
fact, it took me a great deal of persuading to even get you your
corporal's stripes, Santago, if the truth be told.</quote>
   <p>He paused and lowered his voice. <quote>But now something's come up
which, if you do your bit, will maybe enable you to find favour in the
President's eyes.
   <p><quote>For a start, he has given me authority to promote you to
sergeant if all goes well.</quote>
   <p>Santago stopped cleaning the rifle bolt. <quote>To sergeant?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. Now, if he's prepared to forgive you enough to agree to
your promotion to sergeant, well, who knows? Maybe sometime later he
will forgive you completely and grant you a commission.</quote>
   <p>Cordora paused again. <quote>Of course, all that is conjecture. You
will have to carry out this special little job first and qualify
yourself for promotion to sergeant before the officer question could
even be considered.</quote>

<head>Destination Danger</head>
<head>By ERNEST HAYCOX</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY EDWIN PHILLIPS</head>
   <p>Bill wanted her to be his alone &mdash; despite her past. But first
he had to settle a grudge
   <p>THIS was one of those years when Apache smoke signals
spiralled from the mountain tops, when many a ranch-house lay as a
square of blackened ashes and the departure of a stage from Tonto
started an adventure that had no certain ending.
   <p>The stage, with its six horses, waited in Tonto's town square.
On the box was Happy Stewart, the reins between his fingers. John
Strang rode shotgun guard. And an escort of 10 cavalrymen waited
behind the coach, half asleep in their saddles.
   <p>In the dawn, this high air was cold. A small crowd stood in the
square, presenting their final messages to the passengers.
   <p>There was a girl going to marry an infantry officer, a tall, thin
Englishman carrying a sporting rifle, a gambler, a cattleman &mdash; and a
slim blond man. Happy Stuart and the shotgun guard looked at him
with narrow-eyed interest.
   <p>This seemed all until a girl known commonly throughout Arizona
Territory as Henriette walked from the crowd. She was small, with a
touch of paleness in her cheeks. The blond man stepped back from the
coach door and her eyes lifted at his unexpected courtesy. They
showed faint surprise.
   <p>Men in the crowd were smiling &mdash; derisively. But the blond man
turned &mdash; the movement like the swift cut of a knife &mdash; and his
sharp-bright attention covered them until the smiling quit.
   <p>He was a lean man, and stamped as a gun-fighter by the Colts
slung on his hip.
   <p>But it wasn't the guns alone. Something in his face, watchful
and smooth, showed his trade, too.
   <p>Happy Stuart kicked off the brakes and yelled: <quote>Hi!</quote> The
stage rolled from the town in a cloud of dust, the cavalrymen trotting
briskly behind.
   <p>Beyond them stretched the journey no coach had attempted for 45
days. Out below in the desert's distance stood the relay stations
they hoped to reach and pass.
   <p>Between lay a country swept empty by the quick raids of
Geronimo's savages.
   <p>The Englishman, the gambler and the blond man sat jammed together
in the forward seat. The cattleman and the two women shared the rear
seat.
   <p>
   <p>NOW the cattleman leaned towards Henriette, his knees
almost touching her. A huge gold nugget slid gently back and forth
along the gold watch chain slung across his wide chest. His eyes
looked into hers, reading something that caused him to smile.
   <p>They were strangers packed closely together with nothing in
common save a destination.
   <p>Yet the cattleman's smile and the boldness of his glance was
something as audible as speech, noted by everyone except the
Englishman, who sat bolt upright in the corner, covered by stony
indifference.
   <p>The army girl, tall and demurely pretty, threw a quick
side-glance at Henriette, then looked away with a touch of colour.
   <p>Three hours from Tonto the road, making a last round sweep, let
them down into the flat desert.
   <p>From now on they would be on their own. The cavalrymen wheeled
back to town, their sergeant yelling, doubtfully: <quote>Good luck.</quote>
   <p>The miles fell behind and the smell of alkali dust got thicker.
Up on the box, Johnny Strang shifted the gun on his lap. <quote>What's
Malpais Bill &mdash; the blond one &mdash; riding with us for?</quote>
   <p><quote>I guess I wouldn't ask him,</quote> Happy Stuart replied, &mdash; and
studied the hazy horizon.
   <p>All day they were tormented by a cruel, relentless sun. Now as
the coach trundled to a stop outside Gap Station, they were red-eyed
and aching from the stinging dust.
   <p>A short man with a tremendous stomach shuffled through the dusk.
He said: <quote>Wasn't sure you'd get through, Happy.</quote>
   <p><quote>Where's the soldiers for tomorrow?</quote>
   <p><quote>Other side of the mountains. Everybody's chased out. What
ain't forted up here was sent into Lordsburg.</quote>
   <p>He looked first at the army girl, then appraised Henriette
instantly. His eyes slid on to Malpais Bill standing in the
background. Recognition stirred him then and made his voice careful.
<quote>Hello, Bill. What brings you this way?</quote>
   <p>Malpais Bill's cigarette glowed in the gathering dusk and
Henriette caught the brief image of his face, serene and watchful.
Malpais Bill's tone was easy, it was soft. <quote>Just the trip.</quote>
   <p>They were moving on towards the frame house. As the army girl
walked into the station's big room, a soldier in a dishevelled uniform
stepped forward.
   <p>He said: <quote>Miss Robertson? Lieutenant Hauser was to have met
you here. He is at Lordsburg. He was wounded in a brush with the
Apaches last night.</quote>
   <p>The girl stood very still. She said: <quote>Badly?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, yes,</quote> said the soldier.
   <p>Henriette's dove-coloured dress blended with the background
shadows. She was watching the other girl's face whiten.
   <p>But there was a strength in the army girl, a fortitude that made
her think of the soldier. For she said quietly: <quote>You must have had
a bad trip.</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothing &mdash; nothing at all,</quote> said the soldier. As the trooper
left the room, the gambler turned to the army girl with an odd
expression, as though he were remembering painful things.
   <p>After dinner, Malpais Bill lounged, cigarette in hand, in the
yard. The moonlight was a frozen silver that could not dissolve the
desert's incredible blackness.
   <p>
   <p>AS Henriette walked towards him from the Tonto road, her
face was clear and strange and incurious in the night. He said:
<quote>Apaches like to crawl down next to a settlement and wait for
strays.</quote>
   <p>She was indifferent, unafraid. Her voice was cool, and he could
hear the faint loneliness in it, the fatalism that made her words so
even. <quote>There's a wind coming up, so soft and good.</quote>
   <p>He took off his hat, long legs braced and his eyes quick and
puzzled in their watchfulness. His blond hair glowed in the fugitive
light.
   <p>His lips were restless and the sing and rush of strong feeling
was like a current of quick wind around him. It was that unruly.
<quote>You have folks in Lordsburg?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>SHE spoke in a direct patient way as though explaining
something he should have known without asking. <quote>I run a house in
Lordsburg.</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he said, <quote>it wasn't what I asked.</quote>
   <p><quote>My folks are dead &mdash; I think. There was a massacre in the
Superstition Mountains when I was a baby.</quote>
   <p>He stood with his head bowed. There was a hardness and a rawness
to this land and little sympathy for the weak. She had survived, and
had paid for her survival and she looked at him now in a way that
offered no explanation or apologies.
   <p>He said: <quote>Over in the Tonto Basin it's fine land. I still have
a piece of a ranch there &mdash; with a house half built.</quote>
   <p><quote>If that's your country, why are you here?</quote>
   <p>His lips laughed and the rashness in him glowed hot again and he
seemed to grow taller in the moonlight. <quote>A debt to collect.</quote>
   <p><quote>You will never get through collecting those kind of debts.
Everybody in the Territory knows you.
   <p><quote>Once you were just a rancher. Then you tried to wipe out a
grudge and then there was a bigger one to wipe out &mdash; and the debt kept
growing and more men are waiting to kill you. Some day a man will.
Run away from the debts.</quote>
   <p>His bright smile kept constant, which made her shoulders lift in
resignation. <quote>No,</quote> she murmured. <quote>You won't run.</quote>
   <p>He said: <quote>We'd better go back,</quote> and they went across the yard
in silence.
   <p>She turned to look at him once more and then passed down the
narrow corridor to her own quarters.
   <p>Beyond her window in the yard, a man was murmuring to another
man: <quote>Plummer and Shanley are in Lordsburg. Malpais Bill knows
it.</quote>
   <p>Through the thin partition of the adjoining room she heard the
army girl crying with uncontrollable regularity.
   <p>Henriette stared at the dark wall, her shoulders and head bowed.
Then she returned to the hall, knocked on the army girl's door and
went in.
   <p>It was morning. Six fresh horses fidgeted in front of the coach
and the fat host of Gap Station came across the yard swinging a
lantern against the dead, bitter black. All the passengers filed
sleep-dulled and miserable from the house.
   <p>The Gap host grumbled: <quote>If they don't jump you before you get
to Al's ranch, you'll be all right.</quote>
   <p>It was noon when Henriette caught the smell of smoke in the
windless air. Looking through the angled vista of the window panel
she saw a clay and rock chimney standing up like a gaunt skeleton
against the day's light.
   <p>The house that had been there was a black square on the ground,
smoke still rising from pieces that had not been completely burned.
   <p>The stage stopped and all the men were instantly out. An iron
stove squatted on the earth, with one section of pipe stuck upright to
it. Fire licked lazily along the collapsed fragments of what had been
a trunk.
   <p>Beyond the house lay two nude figures grotesquely bald, with
deliberate knife-slashes marking their bodies. Happy Stuart walked
over and returned quickly. <quote>Al and his wife.</quote>
   <p>Malpais Bill knew now that they had a battle ahead. With Happy
and the shotgun guard he clambered on to the coach roof &mdash; ready for
the fight.
   <p>Back on the coach, the gambler said to the army girl: <quote>You're
pretty safe between two fellows.</quote> He hauled a .44 from a back
pocket and laid it on his lap.
   <p>The Englishman pulled the rifle from between his knees and laid
it across the sill of the window. The cattleman swept back his coat
to clear the gun holster.
   <p>Henriette sat with her eyes pinned to the gloved tips of her
fingers, remembering the tall shape of Malpais Bill cut against the
moonlight of Gap Station.
   <p>He had smiled at her as a man might smile at any desirable woman,
with the sweep and swing of laughter in his voice. His eyes had been
gentle.
   <p>The gambler spoke very quietly and she didn't hear him until his
fingers gripped her arm. He said again, not raising his voice: <quote>Get
down.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>HENRIETTE dropped to her knees, hearing gunfire blast
through the rush and run of the coach. Happy Stuart ceased to yell
and the army girl's eyes were round and dark, yet showing no fright.
   <p>Looking upward through the window on the gambler's side,
Henriette saw the weaving figure of an Apache warrior reel nakedly on
a pony and rush by with a rifle raised and pointed in his bony elbows.
   <p>The gambler took a cool aim. The stockman fired and aimed again.
The Englishman's sporting rifle blasted heavy echoes through the
coach, hurting her ears, and the smell of powder got rank and bitter.
   <p>The blond man's boots scraped the coach top and round small holes
began to dimple the panelling as the Apaches' bullets struck.
   <p>An Indian came boldly abreast the coach and made a target that
couldn't be missed. The cattleman dropped him with one shot. The
coach hubs screamed as its wheels slewed around the sharp ruts and the
whole heavy superstructure bounced high in the air.
   <p>The gambler said, quietly: ~<quote>You'd better take this,</quote> handing
Henriette his gun. He leaned against the door, with his small hands
gripping the sill. Pallor loosened the cheeks. He said, to the army
girl: <quote>Be sure to keep between those gentlemen.</quote> He slumped on to
the window sill.
   <p>They were rolling down the mountain without brake. Gunfire fell
off and the crying of the Indians faded back.
   <p>Coming up from her knees then, she saw the desert's flat surface
far below, with the angular pattern of Lordsburg vaguely on the far
borders of the heat fog.
   <p>
   <p>WITH a roar, Happy Stuart's voice lifted again and brakes
were screaming on the wheels, and going off, and screaming again.
   <p>The Englishman stared out of the window sullenly. The army girl
seemed in a deep desperate dream. The cattleman's face was shining
with a strange sweat.

<head>AT THAT MAN'S MERCY</head>
   <p>As Jenny lifted the receiver, an arm suddenly came over her
shoulder and a hairy hand gripped her wrist.
   <p>
   <p>NOTHING WARNED JENNY THAT THE PEACE AND QUIET OF HER LIFE WAS
TO BE SHATTERED.
   <p>
   <p>JENNY put the last of the dishes in the cupboard, and then
walked back into the living-room.
   <p>She wished Ian were back. The house always seemed very still and
quiet when he was away and he would not be home until late.
   <p>Tonight Jenny felt uneasy. That announcement on the radio about
a man who had escaped from the mental institution in a neighbouring
town had disturbed her.
   <p>She stood looking out of the wide bay-window on to the garden.
The great copper beech cast a lacework of moving shadows across the
smooth, sunlit lawn, and in its whispering branches two magpies
quarrelled noisily.
   <p>As far as the eye could see there was nothing but trees, and, in
the distance, the bleak moors, so beautiful, peaceful and isolated.
That was just what she and Ian liked, but not when there was a maniac
at large.
   <p>Jenny sat down on the settee and picked up the paper, trying to
keep calm. After all, there was no reason why he should come here.
The road past their house led only to a small secluded bay a mile or
two further on.
   <p>The reason for his escaping from the asylum was presumably to get
as far away from confinement as possible, in which case he would
naturally go in the opposite direction.
   <p>Her fears somewhat lulled, she began to read. The radio was on
and she could hear the baby upstairs whimper in his sleep.
   <p>The clock was striking six when a loud knock on the door made her
start. Slowly she lowered the newspaper. She wasn't expecting
anyone. Oh, yes, her young sister, Betty, had said she might call.
   <p>She got up and went to the front door. As she opened it, a
good-looking man wearing a grey suit, pushed past her into the hall.
She turned on him indignantly, but before she could protest, he
leaned over her shoulder and shut the door.
   <p>Her mouth went dry. A large hand gripped her arm and turned her
towards the living-room.
   <p><quote>Go on,</quote> the voice said metallically, and the protest died on
her lips as she obeyed.
   <p>She walked over to the settee, and then turned and smiled
nervously.
   <p><quote>Won't you sit down?</quote> she asked, her throat constricted.
   <p><quote>Food, have you any food?</quote> he growled, and there was a strange
glint in his eye as he looked her up and down.
   <p>She swallowed hard, her fingers fumbling nervously with her
wedding ring.
   <p><quote>I haven't got much &mdash; my husband's supper &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Her voice trailed away.
   <p>At the mention of Ian, the stranger half-rose, his eyes wary.
   <p><quote>Your husband, where is he?</quote>
   <p><quote>He'll be back soon.</quote>
   <p><quote>Give me food.</quote>
   <p>His eyes were fixed on her, and, try as she might, she could not
take her own away. There was something almost hypnotic about those
eyes, and yet something lonely &mdash; a loneliness of the spirit that was
terrifying, as though his mind were far beyond reality.
   <p>Suddenly she remembered the announcer on the radio. He had
warned anyone who met this man not to provoke him in any way. The
slightest disagreement could send him into an uncontrollable rage.
   <p>He began to rise slowly from the table.
   <p><quote>Yes, yes, I'll get you some food now,</quote> she said hastily.
   <p>Her hand found the door handle and she slipped out. In the small
alcove by the kitchen, her eyes fell on the telephone. She paused,
looking at it longingly, but a sixth sense made her glance over her
shoulder.
   <p>He was standing in the doorway. Threateningly, he began to walk
towards her. She stooped to pick up her handkerchief, and went on
into the kitchen.
   <p>As she opened the pantry door, he was there behind her. She put
bread on the table, and took the butter and a cold veal and ham pie
from the refrigerator.
   <p>He stood in the middle of the room, watching her every move.
   <p>Putting the food on a tray, she cut a piece of apple tart, and
carried it all into the living-room. Again, he followed close behind
her.
   <p>He sat down at the table and she placed the tray in front of him.
Ignoring the knife and fork, he picked up the meat pie, and, breaking
it in two, began to eat.
   <p>Jenny could feel her hands trembling, and when the man coughed,
her hand jerked, and the sauce bottle lay on its side. A brown stain
slowly spread over the cloth.
   <p>Her hand went out to pick up the fallen bottle &mdash; and froze. She
saw him stop chewing. His eyes were fixed on the spilling sauce.
Then he raised his head and she shrank back. He had the expression
of a wild cat that had been disturbed at its meal.
   <p><quote>Sorry, that was silly of me,</quote> she said, forcing a laugh.
   <p>Then she got up and moved towards the door.
   <p><quote>Where are you going? Come back.</quote>
   <p>The voice was like a whip-lash.
   <p>She closed her eyes and swayed slightly.
   <p><quote>I &mdash; I'm going to make you a cup of tea,</quote> she explained
shakily. <quote>You'd like a drink?</quote>
   <p><quote>Beer.</quote>
   <p>She left the door half-open, and, walking quietly, reached the
alcove. If she could only dial 999. Jenny glanced over her shoulder.
The door was still ajar and there was no sound, except when his hand
touched the cutlery.
   <p>Reaching out, she took hold of the receiver, and raised her left
hand to the dial. She was breathing with difficulty, and her legs
felt unsteady.
   <p>As she lifted the receiver, an arm came over her shoulder and a
hairy hand gripped her wrist. Her heart leaped and the blood pounded
in her ears. For a moment, she was paralysed with fear.
   <p>Then slowly she turned and looked up into his face. She hardly
recognised it. It was very flushed, and seemed to have grown larger.
The mouth was slightly open, and jerked spasmodically at one corner.
   <p>
   <p>HER breath came in gasps as she ran her tongue over her dry
lips. Suddenly his grip tightened and, with a gasp of pain, Jenny
dropped the receiver.
   <p>He stood, still holding her wrist.
   <p><quote>I was just going to ring the doctor to see if he was calling
tomorrow. The baby isn't too well.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're not ringing any doctor,</quote> he said thickly.
   <p><quote>All right then. Come with me, and we'll get that bottle of
beer.</quote>
   <p>She smiled at him hopefully, and he released her wrist.
   <p>Jenny took a few tentative steps forward, and then waited, her
heart pounding. Glancing out of the corner of her eye, she saw him
following. Slowly, she went into the kitchen and took a bottle of
beer out of the refrigerator.
   <p>Back in the living-room, he stood by the table as she opened the
bottle and poured out the drink. She held the glass out to him.
   <p><quote>Come on, drink it. You'll feel better.</quote>
   <p>He took the glass, looking suspiciously at it and then at her.
   <p><quote>What d'you mean, <squote>feel better</squote>?</quote> he growled. <quote>There's
nothing wrong with me.</quote>
   <p>Jenny smiled placatingly.
   <p><quote>No, of course not,</quote> she soothed, <quote>but you said you were very
thirsty. It's a good brand. My husband's very fond of it.</quote>
   <p>He looked at the label.
   <p><quote>I know it's good. I can see, can't I?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, yes, of course. I &mdash; I didn't mean to be rude.</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't say you were rude.</quote> His eyes were beginning to
glaze over. <quote>What's the matter? You think I'm mad, don't you?</quote>
   <p><quote>No &mdash; no. Why should I? Look, drink up. Have a cigarette.</quote>
   <p>She offered him the packet. He took one and examined it, his
thick fingers turning it over and over. He sniffed it, his brows
drawn together in concentration.
   <p>Jenny lit hers and watched him in amazement. Why all this fuss
over an ordinary cigarette?
   <p>She flicked her lighter and held it out. He took hold of her
wrist, bringing the flame to the cigarette. As he puffed, his hands
gripped her more tightly. His eyes met hers through the thin veil of
smoke.
   <p>Her heart pounded and she closed her eyes. That wild look of
animal desire &mdash; and he was mad. She felt utterly weary. Gently she
pulled her arm away.
   <p><quote>Oh, God, please help me,</quote> she prayed inwardly. <quote>I can't
stand much more of this.</quote>
   <p>The baby upstairs began to cry loudly, giving great hiccoughing
sobs. Then his voice rose to a scream. Jenny whipped round and raced
for the door, but the man caught her arm.
   <p><quote>Where are you going?</quote> he demanded.
   <p>His face was fierce and ugly.
   <p><quote>My baby's ill. I must see to him.</quote> She glared at him, fear
forgotten because her little son needed her. <quote>Let me go.</quote>
   <p><quote>Come here. I want you.</quote>
   <p>She took one look at his face, now a deep red, the veins bulging
on his forehead, his madness plain to see. With a desperate effort
she wrenched her arm away and dashed into the hall. She heard him
shout, and start to lumber after her.
   <p>With fear as the spur, she leapt up the stairs, the madman at her
heels. She paused for a split second, and then seizing a large
Chinese vase that stood at the turn of the stairs, she pulled it over
and sent it rolling down.
   <p>It caught him across the thighs, and man and vase crashed in a
heap at the foot of the stairs. Not waiting to see the results, Jenny
dived for the bedroom and slammed the door, turning the key. Gasping,
she leaned back against the door. Looking wildly around the room, her
eye fell on the chest of drawers. It was heavy and made of oak.
   <p>She went across and slowly began to push it over the floor.
Hearing the noise, the baby stopped crying.
   <p>At last the chest was in position. Panting, she pushed her hair
off her forehead and went over to the baby's cot. She lifted him and
laid him on the bed.
   <p>Then, picking up the cot, she carried it into the small ante-room
which led off the main bedroom. There was no other way in, except
through the bedroom. She collected the baby and laid him down in the
cot. Then she drew the curtains, and, going back into the bedroom,
closed the door.
   <p>
   <p>THERE was the muffled sound of scrambling on the stairs.
He was coming up again. She eyed the oak chest. That should hold
him off, at least for a time. She went to the extension phone by the
bed, and, with trembling hands, dialled 999. Soon she was blurting
out all the essential details to the police.
   <p>As she replaced the receiver, Jenny noticed the house was
completely silent again. Where was he now? She went as near to the
door as she could and listened intently &mdash; not a sound.
   <p>She slipped back to the bed and sat down weakly. Taking her
cigarettes out of her pocket, she lit one. Inhaling deeply, she let
her head fall forward.
   <p>Suddenly she jerked upright. That was the side door that had
creaked. He had been outside, but for what? Then nightmare visions
of things she had read in the papers flooded back to her &mdash; of people
being axed to death! Only last week, Ian had bought a new axe. She
could picture its gleaming head now.
   <p>She darted over to the window, and gazed vainly in all
directions. There was not a sight or sound of anyone &mdash; only the
sun-dappled lawn and the whispering trees. Peace was everywhere. She
smiled bitterly.
   <p>Her heart leaped at the sound of an approaching car. Running to
the window Jenny saw it sweep round the bend and pass straight on,
heading for the cove.
   <p>Again there was that awful silence &mdash; silence except for the sound
of a man with an axe, who began to stumble up the stairs.

<head>Continuing Reveille's exciting serial</head>
<head>VICE KING'S SWEETHEART</head>
<head>HIDE-AND-SEEK WITH A KILLER</head>
<head>by Douglas Enefer</head>
   <p>A glance in the driving mirror told me I was being tailed by
another car. I knew the man at the wheel. His name was Ugo
Caramello.
   <p>I had met him a few days earlier &mdash; after I had found lovely Anna
Pavone dead in Rome's famous Fountain of Trevi. He had been with
Anna's sister, Adriana, when I went to tell her the news.
   <p>Adriana had denied that her sister was dead. And Ugo had
threatened me.
   <p>Events moved rapidly after that. I had run across New York
vice-boss Frank Delgarra in Rome in the company of a call-girl, Gina
Vanoni. A few hours later I found Gina murdered &mdash; and Adriana left
for New York to collect an oil fortune she should have shared with her
sister. Helping her to collect would be her fiance, business tycoon
Lance Mallory. I followed.
   <p>I talked to Adriana in her penthouse suite. She told me her
sister had died &mdash; in a car crash. Her eyes and lips had been
inviting. But I had snubbed her and stalked out. Now watchdog Ugo
was following me. And he had a gun in his hand.
   <p>
   <p>I WAS still being tailed by Ugo Caramello in his blue Chev
when I drove downtown through Columbus-circle. He was still keeping
the sort of distance he figured necessary for me not to know I was
being followed.
   <p>But I had seen him.
   <p>At Times-square I made a sharp left turn and went down
Eighth-avenue as fast as the traffic would allow.
   <p>I had not shaken him off, but I was widening the gap. Then I
slewed into Greenwich-avenue and twisted and turned in the little side
streets with their curio shops and outdoor art shows west of
Washington-square.
   <p>When I finally ran the car into a narrow alley I knew I had
Caramello beat. I got out, walked to the mouth of the alley and stood
back under a shop awning waiting for him.
   <p>Three minutes later the blue Chev poked its nose into the street.
   <p>Ugo had his dark glasses off now and was peering around. His
dark Sicilian face was savage with annoyance.
   <p>He killed the car engine, stepped out and dodged into a corner
drugstore across the street.
   <p>I waited for a second, then drifted over the street and pushed
the drug-store doors open.
   <p>Inside four teenage kids, two boys and two girls, were drinking
cokes and chattering.
   <p>
   <p>THE counterman, a hefty lad with the shoulders of a
quarter-back, was polishing glasses with quick, deft movements.
   <p>In the middle of the store a middle-aged guy with waxed
moustaches was reading as much of a magazine as you can do without
buying the thing.
   <p>No sign of Signor Ugo Caramello.
   <p>Then I saw the telephone booth. I strolled down to the end of
the long counter and pushed my ear against the side without glass. I
could just hear Ugo's voice. It seemed a bit agitated.
   <p><quote>Is that Plaza 6-1079, please?</quote> A pause, then: <quote>Who is
speaking, please?</quote> Again a pause. <quote>This is Caramello. I follow
him but he disappear in the traffic.</quote>
   <p>Another pause. <quote>No, I do not know where he went. I &mdash; oh,
damn.</quote>
   <p>I heard the phone slam back on its rest and went fast into the
street and across to my car. I sat in it until Caramello came out and
drove off.
   <p>Then I went back into the drugstore.
   <p>The counterhand eyed me coldly. <quote>You want something, mister?</quote>
I bought a pack of cigarettes, shut myself in the telephone booth and
dialled Plaza 6-1079.
   <p><quote>Mr. Lance Mallory's residence,</quote> said a voice.
   <p>I let the receiver slide down on its cradle and went back to my
car with a head full of thoughts &mdash; none of which started to make
sense.
   <p>I drove home.
   <p>Lesley, the brown-haired girl who operates the switchboard in my
apartment block, looked up pertly as I came in.
   <p><quote>Did you have a nice time in Rome, Mr. Power?</quote>
   <p><quote>Swell.</quote>
   <p><quote>You've a good tan, but otherwise you don't look like a man
fresh back from sunny Italy,</quote> she said critically. <quote>And why aren't
you at the office?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've two more days' leave before I check in,</quote> I told her.
   <p>
   <p>GOING up to the little railing which protects her from the
harsh world, I leaned over and kissed the top of her head.
   <p><quote>I've been counting the hours to that,</quote> she said.
   <p><quote>Put your face up and I'll do better,</quote> I said recklessly.
   <p>Her smooth oval face came up directly. Her mouth was warm and a
little moist and not immobile.
   <p>Finally she moved away from me and said, briskly: <quote>A telephone
message came for you while you were out. From a Miss Adriana
Pavone.</quote>
   <p>She eyed me mockingly. <quote>So they even follow you from Italy, do
they?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, sure &mdash; I see them in rotation,</quote> I said. <quote>What did Miss
Pavone want?</quote>
   <p>Lesley tapped her small teeth with a newly-pointed pencil. <quote>She
said she wanted to speak to you rather urgently, but as you weren't in
she would send a written message. About a half-hour later this
came.</quote>
   <p>She handed me a small, pale-blue envelope.
   <p><quote>Thanks, Lesley.</quote> I had started for the elevator when she
asked innocently: <quote>Aren't you going to open it, Mr. Power?</quote>
   <p>I grinned. <quote>Yeah &mdash; where you can't watch my emotional
reactions.</quote>
   <p>I went up to my apartment and read the letter. I didn't know
quite what I had expected &mdash; if I had expected anything in
particular &mdash; but what it said shook me.

   <p>Dear John &mdash; I was very distressed when you left me with those
dreadful words. I simply do not know what I can do to convince you
how wrong you are. But I shall never have the opportunity &mdash; because
tonight I am flying back to Rome.
   <p>I have been uncertain for some time about my engagement to Mr.
Mallory and today I decided not to marry. I have explained this to
him and I think he understands &mdash; better, I am afraid, than you
understand me. So it is goodbye &mdash; Adriana Pavone.

   <p>I dropped the letter on my desk and rammed tobacco into the
biggest pipe I have. The hell with Adriana Pavone!
   <p>If she wanted to skip back to Rome &mdash; let her. I didn't give a
damn.
   <p>
   <p>JUST the same, I found myself picking up the letter and
reading it again.
   <p>So she wasn't marrying Mallory. Maybe she wanted old man Power?
   <p>Maybe she didn't care about either of us? Maybe she didn't care
about New York once she had latched on to that five-million-dollar
pay-off? The thoughts jostled through my mind &mdash; and came to a sudden
stop.
   <p>She could not hope to conclude a deal like that in a couple of
days, could she?
   <p>She was just stalling.
   <p><quote>I'm flying back to Rome, my sweet, so you don't any longer
need to poke your goddam nose into my affairs...</quote>
   <p>That could be it.
   <p>I grabbed the telephone and got through to the air terminal.
   <p><quote>Is there a reservation on the night flight to Rome in the name
of Signorina Adriana Pavone?</quote> I asked. <quote>I have to contact her
before she checks in.</quote>
   <p>A girl clerk answered: <quote>Wait a minute, sir. I'll find out.</quote>
   <p>There was a long pause. I dragged pipe smoke in coughing clouds.
   <p>Then the line came alive again. <quote>Sorry, sir. We have no
reservation in that name.</quote>
   <p><quote>The morning flight tomorrow, then?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've looked, sir. No one of that name is booked to Rome.</quote>
   <p><quote>Thanks,</quote> I said thickly.
   <p>
   <p>FIFTEEN minutes later I was driving north again. The
commissionaire wasn't on hand at the plushy hotel where Adriana was
staying, so I rode myself straight up to the penthouse suite.
   <p>The door was locked. I banged on it three times. That made it
open about a foot and a face came into slit view &mdash; a thin, faintly
yellowed face with eyes like deadly sins and shining crinkly hair.
   <p>He was around twenty-five years old and looked like a Filipino
houseboy. Before, I had not noticed that she had one.
   <p><quote>Miss Adriana Pavone,</quote> I said. <quote>John Power calling.</quote>
   <p>He twisted a wide mouthful of teeth into a grin.
   <p><quote>Miss Pavone not in, sir.</quote>
   <p><quote>You know where she's gone?</quote>
   <p><quote>No sir. But no come back.</quote> The grin had died but the
eyes were alert. Too alert.
   <p><quote>I haven't seen you here before, have I?</quote>
   <p>I put a foot in the door as I said it. He looked down at the
foot and smiled a long slow smile.
   <p><quote>If you are friend of hers, I tell,</quote> he said. <quote>Miss
Pavone left just now with all her baggage. She fly back to Rome,
sir.</quote>
   <p><quote>On the night flight?</quote>
   <p>He started to nod, then checked himself. But he was too late.
   <p><quote>The night flight doesn't take off until eleven-thirty,</quote> I
said.
   <p><quote>She has some shopping to do first, I think.</quote> His eyes were
snapping at me now. A tiny globule of saliva pooled on the left side
of his mouth.
   <p>I swung my shoulder against the door. He reeled back, his arms
flailing.
   <p>I went in.
   <p><quote>You're lying, Flip. Where's she gone &mdash; and why?</quote>
   <p>He backed warily from me, going across the hallway towards the
wide lounge. Then, without warning, he lunged.
   <p>Something long and blue and shining had slid down his sleeve into
his right hand.
   <p>I hit him on the point of the jaw with everything I had. For a
second he seemed to hang, suspended in mid air. Then he zoomed
backwards, hit the floor and rolled over.
   <p>But he was not done.
   <p>He came face-upwards on the roll, his wrist angled for a
knife-throw.
   <p>I trod savagely on his wrist and ground it until he screamed his
agony. The flick-knife jumped out of his hand, clattering over the
floor.
   <p>I reached down, hooked him up by his collar, and hit him one more
time in the mouth. I felt a couple of his teeth crack.
   <p>
   <p>HE sat sprawled on a large sofa, his mouth full of blood
and his eyes full of death. I felt inside his jacket and down the
outside of his pants. He was not wearing artillery.
   <p><quote>All right &mdash; talk,</quote> I barked.
   <p>He dragged a handkerchief from his breast-pocket and dabbed at
his mouth. I took the gun from under my arm, the big Luger I thought
I had not needed in Rome.
   <p><quote>You can go into the bathroom and fix your mouth,</quote> I said.
   <p>He stood up soundlessly and speechlessly and glided across the
hallway and through a door. I went in after him and watched while he
got the dislodged teeth out of his face.
   <p><quote>All right,</quote> I said again, <quote>tell it.</quote>
   <p>He smiled wolfishly, but no words came.
   <p><quote>I could beat it out of you, Flip,</quote> I said, <quote>but I haven't
the time and I haven't sadistic instincts.
   <p><quote>On the other hand, I could drag you down to police headquarters
and the boys could stand you under the lights.</quote>
   <p>He swayed against the wash-basin, killing me with his eyes.
   <p>I shrugged. <quote>I haven't the time for that, either. You stay
tied up in the locked bathroom until I get back &mdash; with a gag in your
mouth. And if it's damned uncomfortable I'm not going to shed
tears.</quote>
   <p>I turned the lock and went into the big lounge. I dropped the
key on to Adriana's writing desk. Something was on it. A piece of
paper, pale blue, like that she had used to write to me.
   <p>It had writing on it, too:

   <p>Dear John &mdash; I was very distressed when you left me with those
dreadful words. I simply do not know what I can do to convince you
how wrong you are, but I would like &mdash;

   <p>There was no more. Just a letter she had begun and then
started again on another sheet.
   <p>Pushed against the back of the desk top was a newspaper, folded
down on black headlines which read:
   <p>FRANK DELGARRA, BACK FROM ROME, TALKS OF BIG DEAL.

<text id=LOBN23>
   <p>Durieux unbuttoned the right breast pocket of his parachute
smock, his fingers fumbling with the stiffness of the new canvas.
   <p><squote>This is my party card,</squote> he said, holding it high, that all
might see it. <squote>I am more proud of this card than of this badge.</squote>
   <p>When he said this, Durieux tapped the silver-nickel badge that
was pinned to the flap of his right breast pocket. The badge
consisted of an opened parachute flanked by wings. Cynics said the
wings had been added to remind the wearer that he might one day have
need of them, for parachute-packing is not an exact science, and
parachute packers have been known to err. The badge meant that
Durieux's parachute had six times successfully responded to his pull
at the ripcord, with himself dangling from the rigging lines,
fluttering to earth like an autumn leaf discarded from the military
tree.
   <p><squote>Is it a real party card?</squote> asked Rossi. <squote>It's not like any
party card that I ever saw. I'll bet it's a forgery.</squote>
   <p><squote>See for yourself,</squote> shouted Durieux, thrusting the card close
to the Corsican's face.
   <p>Rossi spat very deliberately, and very messily, upon Durieux's
party card. The other paras, who had guessed what was to come,
shouted with laughter.
   <p><squote>I'm going to make you lick that card clean,</squote> said Durieux.
   <p>He reached down for the nape of Rossi's neck with his left hand.
His intention was to force the Corsican's nose into the spittle. But
Rossi jerked Durieux's heels from beneath him. Durieux pitched
forward, falling over Rossi. Durieux could have clutched at Rossi to
save himself, but he still held on to the party card and would not let
it go. The restraining hands of two paras, one at either side of
Rossi, were all that saved Durieux from falling into the fire.
   <p>One of the paras who held Durieux spun him roughly about, so that
he stumbled away from the fire. His first concern was for the party
card. It was scorched &mdash; as were the fingers that held it &mdash; and
Rossi's spittle was bubbling on the cardboard. Durieux wiped the card
clean, using great care, with his handkerchief. He placed the card
back in his breast pocket and buttoned it beneath the parachute badge.
Only then did he return to Rossi, who was still lying beside the
fire.
   <p><squote>Now you won't be able to make me lick it off,</squote> said Rossi.
   <p><squote>I'll do better than that,</squote> promised Durieux. <squote>Get up,
Rossi.</squote>
   <p><squote>Enchanted by the invitation, comrade Durieux.</squote>
   <p>Rossi arose with the muscular tension of a caged leopard at
feeding time. Durieux almost regretted having issued the invitation.
Rossi was tall, but he did not tower above Durieux; he was broad, yet
not significantly wider than Durieux; but he was unmistakably the more
aggressive.
   <p>Looking at Rossi, Durieux could not believe that his opponent
possessed the fighting instincts of a mere man: it was as though the
Corsican belonged spiritually to another species. The leopard-skin
pattern upon his parachute smock might have been an outward expression
of his character.
   <p>Yet Durieux was no coward, nor was he easily intimidated. So he
fired his right fist into Rossi's face and caught the Corsican on the
mouth. His knuckles made a wooden sound against Rossi's teeth. Rossi
rode the blow, swaying back from the hips upon which his hands still
rested, but his lips split like an over-ripe tomato. Blood flowed
from them and ran down his chin like wine. Rossi ran his tongue over
the blood: he seemed to savour the taste; he was smiling.
   <p>Then Rossi struck Durieux a terrible blow that landed midway
between crutch and waist. Durieux had never been hit so hard before,
though he had become an amateur boxer in his student days in order to
gain popularity and engender self-confidence. But he had never even
imagined that it was possible to be hit so hard. The blow took all
pleasure out of anger, out of fighting, out of life itself. Durieux's
head went down until it was level with his knees. He folded up so
fast that Rossi's second blow &mdash; a right cross &mdash; landed on his temple.
Instead of breaking Durieux's jaw, as Rossi had intended it should,
the blow split his scalp. He was felled to the ground as a bullock is
felled by a humane killer. His head suddenly became enormous and
empty: the echoes of the blow rang through his brain like the angelus
bell in a church tower. He felt the blood move stickily from his
split scalp and trickle down his forehead. He felt as though all
feelings were at an end.
   <p>Then Durieux realized that he was still capable of having such
primitive feeling as pain. He could still hear, despite the sounding
in his ears, despite the lights behind his eyes, despite the knotted
cramp of his intestines. And Durieux became intensely relieved that
he could still experience these things.
   <p>If he hits me like that again, thought Durieux, he will
undoubtedly kill me. If by chance he does not kill me I shall be
crippled for life. Even if he fails to kill or cripple me I shall be
permanently disfigured. None of these things is going to help
propagate Marxist-Leninist doctrines.
   <p>Therefore, Durieux continued when he could hear himself thinking,
I must somehow save myself. The best thing I can do is lie still and
let him think that he has knocked me out. If everyone believes that
Rossi has knocked me out they will not expect me to get up and fight
him again. The fight is over. Even the best boxers get themselves
knocked out, especially by a lucky blow. There is no dishonour in
that. I struck the first blow. I have shown them all that I am not
afraid of Rossi. I was disabled by a foul blow and knocked out by a
lucky blow. It was almost an accident. I have now earned my place by
the fire. I believe that I really must have been knocked out. I am
only just coming to my senses. That is why I am only now able to
think clearly. I was knocked out, but I bear Rossi no ill-will. The
fight is finished.
   <p><squote>He's shamming,</squote> said Rossi.
   <p><squote>He's shagged,</squote> said someone.
   <p><squote>Balls,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>I was playing with him. I only used
my fists. I want to have some fun out of this fight. It's a long
time since I fought a Viet.</squote>
   <p><squote>He isn't a Viet,</squote> said someone else. <squote>He's only a
commie.</squote>
   <p><squote>Viet or commie,</squote> said Rossi, <squote>I'm going to beat the crap out
of him. I'll teach the depot to send us commies.</squote>
   <p><squote>They probably didn't know he was a commie,</squote> said someone
else. <squote>You know how the bastards infiltrate.</squote>
   <p><squote>They'll know he's a commie when I've finished with him,</squote> said
Rossi.
   <p>Durieux felt a sudden pain in his side; and he was flung over on
his back. The kick had landed sickeningly just below his ribs.
Durieux was relieved that Rossi was wearing rubber-soled jumping
boots and not the steel-tipped infantry issue.
   <p><squote>Don't kick him,</squote> said a voice, Marechal's voice.
   <p><squote>He's a subversive,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>I could kick him to death
and get congratulated for it. I caught him encouraging us to read
left-wing journals, didn't I? Wasn't he about to encourage us lads to
desert?</squote>
   <p><squote>That's a load of bull,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>You needled him
until he produced his party card.</squote>
   <p><squote>I knew he was a commie,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>I can smell the
bastards out as surely as I can smell the bogs.</squote>
   <p><squote>Perhaps he's an ex-commie now,</squote> said someone. <squote>It looks as
though you did him in.</squote>
   <p><squote>He's firing at the flank,</squote> said Rossi.
   <p><squote>He's been shamming for a long time then,</squote> said someone else.
<squote>Not everyone has a head as thick as yours, Rossi.</squote>
   <p><squote>I'll hold a light under his mug and see if he moves,</squote> said
Rossi.
   <p>Durieux could smell the brand from the fire as Rossi approached
him. It was so close that he inhaled the sweet smoke, and felt the
heat glow against his eyelids. He decided that it was time to groan
as a preliminary to feigning a return to consciousness. Rossi kicked
him again, but mildly this time, an exploratory kick. Durieux raised
his head slightly, let it loll back, and opened his eyes. Rossi threw
the blazing brand back into the fire.
   <p>Durieux groaned again. He rolled his eyes and raised himself on
one elbow. The recovery, he decided, must be very gradual; otherwise
Rossi might take it as an invitation to renew the fight. He groaned
and sank back again.
   <p><squote>Commies,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>I could crap a better commie.</squote>
   <p>Marechal stood up and walked over to where Durieux lay. He was
carrying his canteen and he offered it to Durieux.
   <p><squote>Drink this,</squote> said Marechal.
   <p><squote>He doesn't drink,</squote> said Rossi in a mincing voice. <squote>And it's
quite possible that he doesn't poke either.</squote>
   <p><squote>He'll learn to do both,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>And to fight.
He's got a lot to learn.</squote>
   <p>Durieux took the canteen, not because he wanted to drink, but
because to lie there drinking would prolong the period before he must
rise. So he drank slowly. He found that he was drinking neat pastis.
The liquorice taste was unmistakable even though he had not tasted it
before. He spluttered and coughed as the liquid ran down his throat
and surged into his stomach. But he suddenly felt a great deal
better.
   <p>This stuff is liquid fire, thought Durieux. It's like napalm.
What do you know of napalm? he asked himself out of journalistic
habit. Nothing, he admitted, or very little, but I'd like to have
some for Rossi, he told himself. I'd like to see that bastard burn.
   <p><squote>Go easy with that stuff, man, if you aren't used to it,</squote> he
heard Marechal warning him.
   <p><squote>It will do him good,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>It may even put some
guts into the miserable little sod.</squote>
   <p>Accepting this as encouragement, Durieux took another long drink
from the canteen before returning it to Marechal. Then he looked
directly at Rossi. Durieux forced himself to be no longer afraid of
Rossi.
   <p><squote>Shut your dirty trap, Rossi, or I'll shut it for you,</squote> he
announced.
   <p><squote>Want some more?</squote>
   <p><squote>I'll smash your mug in,</squote> said Durieux.
   <p>He lurched to his feet and as suddenly sat down again, for the
ground appeared to rise with him. He got to his knees and became
conscious of pain where Rossi had struck the blow. Durieux fell
forward and was violently sick in the fire: yellow bile that bubbled
and spluttered. Everything tasted and stank of aniseed. But when he
had wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, Durieux felt much
better.
   <p><squote>Now I'll finish him off,</squote> said Rossi.
   <p><squote>Shut up,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>He's beaten up already. Leave
the poor bastard be. What's the matter with you, man? Can't you find
anyone of your own weight to fight?</squote>
   <p><squote>Are you looking for a boy beneath your blanket?</squote> asked Rossi.
   <p><squote>You know me,</squote> said Marechal.
   <p><squote>Why else should anyone want to protect a commie from what's
coming to him?</squote> asked Rossi.
   <p>Durieux had at last succeeded in staying on his feet. The stars
of the African night were duplicated in his head. The pastis had
entered his blood stream.
   <p><squote>I'm going to have your guts for a tie,</squote> he told Rossi.
   <p><squote>He's as pissed as a Pole,</squote> said Marechal.
   <p><squote>I can lick any man in this stick,</squote> announced Rossi.
   <p><squote>Except me,</squote> Marechal reminded him.
   <p><squote>I can lick you in a stand up and smash down fight,</squote> shouted
Rossi. <squote>Who cares about wrestling?</squote>
   <p><squote>I care, man,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>I like to wrestle
sometimes.</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm going to do you both,</squote> announced Durieux, approaching
them at a stagger. <squote>I'm going to do the whole world.</squote>
   <p><squote>You're too ambitious,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>Has anyone got some
black coffee?</squote>
   <p>Someone handed over a mug of black coffee and Marechal gave it to
Durieux. Durieux spilled some of the coffee down the front of his
uniform; it mingled with the stains of his blood, now drying out
brown, and merged well with the dapple-camouflage pattern.

<head>A Night in the Firth</head>
<head>BY JOHN MACGILLIVRAY</head>
   <p>WILLIE MOIR is a big-boned, fresh, sandy-haired young man
of about twenty-five, with bushy brows and a ready smile. He was
washing himself at the sink after a day spent working hard in the
wood, and his evening meal was all ready hot and steaming on the
table.
   <p>His father was sitting there waiting for Willie to join him,
whilst his mother, short and tubby, was hovering between the oven and
the table, like a broody hen; not quite clucking.
   <p>As he dried himself Willie said: <quote>I came round by the harbour
on my way home. Jimmy Fraser was there and I think I'll go with him
the night. Fishing. He's going out later on.</quote>
   <p><quote>Fishing?</quote> his father asked. <quote>I was never fishing in my
life.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why d'ye not come with us then? It'll be a grand night. You
could come.</quote>
   <p><quote>No' me. I don't like boats.</quote>
   <p><quote>Were you ever on one?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, many a one. Troopships, in the war. Men and horses all
together &mdash; and comin' home when it was done. I don't like them at
all.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ach, be quiet. That's different altogether. You couldna'
get a goat on Jimmy's boat, never mind a horse. It'll be fine and
quiet, oot on the firth.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, maybe quiet. It's quiet enough here for me. I'm no'
going. Come and get your tea before it's cold.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's right. Sit in, Willie. You'll be hungry I'm sure, out
all day. Sit in,</quote> said his mother.
   <p><quote>I don't ken one fish from the other,</quote> said the father.
<quote>Except maybe a salmon and a spelding. They're a' the same to me.
I like fish. Or a herring.</quote>
   <p><quote>A spelding's a haddie,</quote> said Willie. <quote>It's smoked.</quote>
   <p><quote>Maybe it is. What time are you going wi' Jimmy?</quote>
   <p><quote>Aboot ten o'clock. It's the tide.</quote>
   <p><quote>H'm. An' what time will you be home?</quote>
   <p><quote>In the morning. About nine o'clock maybe.</quote>
   <p><quote>And what aboot your work?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ach, it's Saturday. Surely I can take a Saturday morning once
in the year. It's no' much; only a half holiday.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a half day just the same. It wouldna do if we were all
taking half days.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ach, be quate. In the Sooth they don't work on any
Saturdays at all, and they do all right.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, the kind o' them! I'd shoot the half o' them. What kind
o' an engine has he in the boatie?</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a Diesel,</quote> said Willie. <quote>Very good, he says, when it
goes. Hasna quite got the hang o' it yet.</quote>
   <p><quote>Watch yoursel' then. Don't be goin' to America or something.
You'll maybe be sick, will you? Can you swim?</quote>
   <p><quote>All Commandos can swim,</quote> said Willie. <quote>But I'm no' swimming
the night. Too cold. I'll take a flask o' tea wi' me, Mam, and a few
sandwiches.</quote>
   <p><quote>All right, boy, all right. I'll make them ready for you at
nine o'clock. Will that do?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, fine. I'll be in for them then.</quote>
   <p>Big Charlie, the father, took a turn outside in the calm, long
summer evening. The hills to the south, and Ben Wyvis to the west,
stood clear and near.
   <p>He could occasionally hear the sea washing on the beach, and he
remembered those other hot sandy beaches and the warm middle sea, so
many years ago.
   <p>Willie collected his food parcel and made for the harbour, going
in through the fishertown. Here and there people were gossiping at
gable corners in twos or threes, mostly short round folk, men and
women, the men with layers of jerseys and clean flat caps.
   <p>Jimmy Fraser was a fisherman. Fresh, wrinkly-faced,
clean-shaven, and good natured, he was working on the deck of his boat
Magda, and called to Willie, <quote>That you, Wull? Stop there till I
start the Diesel, then bring in the lines and we'll away.</quote> He
disappeared down a small hatch and Willie could hear him at the
engine.
   <p>Jimmy came up and into the little wheelhouse, waving Willie to
come aboard with the mooring lines; then he gently edged the nose of
his craft across the still harbour towards the entrance and the firth.
   <p><quote>Just the two o' us, Jimmy?</quote> asked Willie.
   <p><quote>Ay, ay, Wull. It's no' much the night, just a few lines, I
thought we'd manage fine. Mind your feet when we get outside, she'll
maybe lift.</quote>
   <p>As the evening spent the light grew less and the firth turned
dark grey. The breeze blowing across the tide made a little lop on
the surface, so when Magda left the shelter of the harbour her bow
lifted to the lop and she heeled to the push of the breeze. Jimmy
increased his speed and the exhaust beat hardened, though still not
fast.
   <p>They turned to the north-east, heading for the darkening, and the
bows set to a rolling lift and fall, slight and regular. <quote>She'll do
six or seven knots, dependin',</quote> said Jimmy. <quote>She's no' just right
this last few days. But there's no great hurry.</quote>
   <p><quote>Can I no' steer her?</quote> asked Willie. <quote>I think I'll manage
her. What way are we going?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, take her, Wull. Here and I'll show you. I'll go and
make a droppie tea. Gie me a call if you see anything.</quote>
   <p>He went below and Willie had the night and the boat to himself.
As Magda chugged through the dark he constantly glanced at the
little tell-tale compass. Sky had merged with black sea all ahead,
but away to the north-west, on his left hand, it wasn't yet so black
dark, and an occasional light blinked or flashed over there. <quote>Tarbat
Ness,</quote> he thought. <quote>Or maybe the Sutors.</quote> He was startled when
Jimmy's voice at his shoulder said, <quote>Here y'are, Wull. Tea. I'll
take her while you drink it. There's a light in the cabin if you want
to sit below.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll have it up here, Jim.</quote>
   <p>Willie enjoyed the hot sweet tea, standing on the deck in the
cool of the night, leaning against the wheelhouse and taking his ease.
   <p><quote>It's near twelve o'clock, Jimmy</quote> he said. <quote>When will we get
to your lines?</quote>
   <p><quote>Aboot two, boy; near the slack o' the tide. We'll get the
first o' the light. Are you for the wheel again?</quote>
   <p><quote>Aye, Jim, I'll take her. You get your tea.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>Willie leant slightly forward over the wheel as he conned the
boat, peering into the dark. With a lurch he fell forward over the
spokes, and one of them drove blunt into the pit of his stomach,
stealing his wind, at the same time as he heard Magda's bow strike
with a thump. She paused, and the Diesel missed a beat; before it
regained its regular chug Jimmy was on deck, running to the bow,
stumbling in the dark.
   <p><quote>What is it, Wull?</quote> he shouted. <quote>What ha' we struck?</quote>
   <p>Willie gasped deep, trying to recover his breath. <quote>Don' know,
Jim. Never saw a thing. What is it?</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a dam' tree. Gie's a han' to shift it, man. Wait you
till I put the Diesel oot o' gear.</quote> The engine idled easily,
relieved of its load, and together they went forward where Jimmy's
torch revealed the tree with some branches reaching into the dark,
still across the bow, held there by way of the boat, which hadn't
quite stopped.
   <p><quote>It's doon from the hills wi' the storms and the floods,</quote>
said Jimmy. <quote>I'll back her away from it. Push wi' this boathook,
Wull. Take care an' no' lose it.</quote>
   <p>Willie pushed as best he could, and when the engine ground the
boat astern they came free of the tree and Jimmy released the engine
again.
   <p><quote>What a dunt,</quote> he said. <quote>I wonder has it sprung the
stem.</quote> He went below into the hold, shining his torch.
   <p><quote>Looks a'right, Wull,</quote> he said when he came back. <quote>Just a
bit o' a weep. She'll be a'right if we don't force her.</quote>
   <p>Before the first gleam had showed in the north-east sky Jimmy had
taken the wheel and set Magda more to the south, easing her along
as the dawn came to them. His eyes were screwed nearly closed as he
searched ahead, to right and to left over the face of the sea, and
always he sniffed. Then <quote>Ay,</quote> he said. <quote>They're there, boy.
That's my buoy. Bring over that bait, Wull, in the two baskets at
the bow.</quote> He had cut the engine to idling speed; the boat was
losing way, coming up to the fishing buoy dead slow.
   <p>Jim had explained the job to Willie. They were to lift each line
and rebait it, taking aboard any catch that might be on the hooks. It
was to be a busy job because Magda had to be watched and guided as
well, and Jim knew how best to do this. <quote>See and mind your fingers
wi' the hooks, Wull,</quote> he said.
   <p>Most of the lines had bare hooks as they were hauled aboard,
where the bait had been taken and the fish had escaped, but there were
fishes on some and these flopped and slithered about, trying to get
back to sea. They had nearly filled their second box of fish when Jim
called a halt.
   <p><quote>It's near hand six o'clock, boy. We'll have some more tea,
will we? Then we can work on and away home. There's wind coming from
the south-west. We'll need to work fast.</quote>
   <p>He was edging Magda across to his further lines whilst they
ate their bite in the fresh cold morning air.
   <p><quote>She's no' just right, man,</quote> he said. <quote>Kin' o' grinding a'
the time.</quote> And then, ~<quote>Oh, damn, what's that now?</quote> as the engine
laboured to a standstill.
   <p><quote>Something wrong this time, Jimmy. Let's have a look.</quote> Jimmy
put the engine out of gear and turned it over with the starting
handle. <quote>The engine's free enough; wonder is it the shaft? Maybe
we've caught up my headrope.</quote>
   <p><quote>How can we see, Jim?</quote>
   <p><quote>From the small boat, Wull. We'll put her over. Make fast that
line, so we'll no' lose her.</quote>
   <p>Together they lifted the small boat overside, near Magda's
stern, and Jimmy crouched down in it, searching through the water,
trying to see the propellor.
   <p><quote>I canna see it, Wull,</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>It's all grey. I canna see clear at all. If I could swim
I'd doon and have a look at it.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm no' wanting to wait here, Jim. I'll go in and have a look
at it. It's damn cold, though.</quote>
   <p><quote>Will you manage, boy?</quote>
   <p><quote>Fine that. What do I have to do?</quote>
   <p><quote>Just see is there a rope or something holding the propellor,
and take it off. Cut it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Better get me a sharp knife, then. Tie a string to it.</quote>
   <p>Willie stripped naked and stepped back into the small boat,
shivering. Jim followed with his opened gully, a long string tied to
its handle.
   <p><quote>Have a look first, Wull. You'll need to work fast. The
water's cold.</quote>
   <p><quote>I ken fine it's cold. I can feel it. Here goes,</quote> and
Willie eased himself overside into the sea. <quote>Hoo,</quote> he wheezed,
then, holding his nose, he bent over and kicked his way downhill. In
half a minute he surfaced.
   <p><quote>Losh, it's cold. Gie's the knife. There's rope tight wound
between the propellor and the boat. I'll need to cut it.</quote> He dived
again and stayed under for about a minute, bobbing up blowing and
wheezing.
   <p><quote>It's tight and tough,</quote> he said, teeth chattering, and went
back to it. Several times he dived. Jimmy began to worry because
Willy was obviously wearying in the cold north water.
   <p><quote>This time, Jim. Finish this time.</quote> When next he surfaced he
held up an arm, holding to the small boat with the other. <quote>Gie's
han',</quote> he panted.
   <p>Jimmy hauled on the arm, then on a leg, and Willie rolled
exhausted into the bottom of the boat. <quote>I'm done,</quote> he gasped,
breathing deep and shivering violently.
   <p><quote>Oot o' here, Wull, man. Back aboard and get dry. You'll get
your death,</quote> ordered Jim.

<head>Vendetta!</head>
<head>by Brian Cleeve</head>
   <p>THEY faced each other in the lamplit room, her hands pale
against the black of her dress, clasped together, as if she was afraid
of what he would say to her, or of what she would answer.
   <p><quote>Tell me what really happened,</quote> he whispered. <quote>How did your
father die?</quote> He saw the hands twist, the fingers clench with the
effort of holding the words in. <quote>Was he killed?</quote> he said.
   <p>She lifted one hand, pressed its knuckles against her mouth.
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> she breathed. <quote>They killed him...</quote> She turned
away, towards the deep, narrow window that looked out on the valley,
and Mount Tamborene. There was no moon yet, and the stars were heavy
as gold coins in the South Italian sky.
   <p><quote>And your brother? Silvio?</quote>
   <p><quote>What do you think?</quote> she said, trying to keep the bitterness
from her voice. <quote>He is carrying on the vendetta. Like a hero of the
old times.</quote> She leant her forehead against the cool plaster of the
wall, beside the window. <quote>He is up there, on the mountain. Stealing
their sheep. Burning their shepherds' huts. While we stay here...</quote>
   <p>She was crying now, with a quiet despair that was worse than if
she had screamed aloud. He was afraid to touch her: afraid of many
things, perhaps most of all to wake the thing that he had tried to
forget after all the years in the North, since he left this house.
   <p>Seven years. Seven years ago, stealing out of the house on a
night as dark as this. Running away, a boy's dream in his mind that
one day he would come back with a fortune, to dazzle this family that
had taken him in as an orphan, saved his life &mdash; and exacted the
fullest price for it that they could.
   <p>He had been seven years old when they found him, a piece of
wartime flotsam cast up in a Calabrian valley from God knew where.
Starving, remembering nothing but his name, Ettore, and a
mind-picture of buildings lit by a fantastic glare, tumbling, falling,
while a woman screamed.
   <p>And the Feltri, the richest family in the valley, had let him
sleep in a corner of their yard, and fed him scraps in return for
work; drawing water, minding the goats and chickens, seeing that this
girl beside him didn't stray out of the courtyard. She had been five
then, small and dark and supple as a kitten; running away from him,
laughing at him, hiding, while he ran after her in despair, calling
~<quote>Ginevra, Ginevra,</quote> terrified that he would be beaten or left
without food for not minding her properly.
   <p>There had been Silvio too, almost his own age, but already a
young prince, slender and arrogant. It had been Silvio who gave him
his new name, Orfano. Ettore the Orphan. He had grown up to carry
the name with a kind of sullen pride.
   <p>But for that name he might truly have become one of the family.
They were kind enough to him, as far as they understood what kindness
was. After the first year or so, they didn't beat him any more. They
gave him his place in life against the world, as they gave it to their
dogs, their shepherds, the women who worked in the house, the peasants
who worked on their olive terraces. He belonged to them, to their
faction, opposing the other faction in the village, that of the
Crespi, bitter enemies of the Feltri for more than a hundred years.
   <p>He might have grown up to be like Silvio's true brother, or
cousin, but for that name, Orfano. The children in the village
shrieked it after him, <quote>the orphan, the orphan!</quote> Sometimes at
night he prayed, <quote>When I wake up tomorrow, let me remember my real
name.</quote> But he never did. Only the buildings falling, burning, the
woman screaming.
   <p>The only person that he was really close to was Ginevra;
protecting her from her brother; bringing her new-born chicks in his
cap for an Easter gift. He pretended to himself that both she and he
were orphans; that they were the brother and sister, not she and
Silvio. He gave her all the love that he would have given his whole
family, if he had had one...
   <p>Until quite suddenly, between one day and the next, he realised
that it had become a different kind of love. For a week he had held
the knowledge inside himself, half ecstasy, half terror, like a
pleasure so unbearable that it becomes agony. Then, one evening, when
both of them were drawing water by the well, he had told her what he
felt; had taken her hands, held them against his heart, drawn her
close to him, so close that he could feel the warmth of her breath
against his mouth...
   <p><quote>Ettore?</quote> she had breathed, afraid of what she saw in his
face, what she felt stirring in herself. <quote>Ettore...</quote> And he had
kissed her; not wanting to, holding himself back as if it was a
sacrilege, and yet drawn down to her. And then they had really
kissed, and it was like drunkenness, like falling, like fire in the
mouth, and they both leaned against the well, sick and dizzy, hardly
able to see one another.
   <p>But her father had seen. He came out from the house, shouting
curses. He knocked Ettore to the ground and beat him with a harness
strap until he was barely conscious.
   <p>That night Ettore ran away. He had known that there was no
chance of his being allowed even to speak to Ginevra again. He ran
away, to make his fortune. In a year he would be back, with a motor
car and a sack of gold, and he would pour the gold on the great
kitchen table in front of all of them. When he told them that he had
come back to marry Ginevra, they would go down on their knees to him
in gratitude.
   <p>But that dream had faded very soon, as he begged his way north,
picking up what work he could in Rome, in Bologna, in Milan, Turin.
Until eventually in Turin the police picked him up as a vagabond,
found that he was due for his military service, and shipped him off to
the barracks instead of the gaol.
   <p>He thrived as a soldier. He was drafted into the engineers,
showed promise and intelligence, and was trained as a road surveyor.
When he finished his service, one of his officers found him a job
with a road construction company, and for two years he was working in
the Alps. Calabria, the Feltri &mdash; even Ginevra &mdash; seemed to belong to
another world.
   <p>He felt that it was better like that. It would do him no good to
carry useless regret through life. He tried never to think of her...
   <p>And then the construction company was granted a contract in
Calabria. Ettore Orfano was assigned to it because he knew the
dialect, and would get on with the local workmen. And suddenly he
found himself within twenty miles of Tamborene, and the house which
for ten years of his life had been his home.
   <p>
   <p>FOR a month he debated in his mind whether to go back, then
whether to write first, or simply to arrive. Finally he compromised.
A week's leave was due to him, and he simply wrote that he was
coming, and followed his letter so closely that there would be no time
for a reply.
   <p>He spent the hour-long journey in the bus trying over a dozen
different speeches for his arrival, wondering how they would receive
him, nursing the little pile of gifts in his lap: a pipe for Giovanni
Feltri; silk scarves for the women; a box of cheroots for Silvio. He
was half-eager to walk into the great kitchen with its smoke-blackened
timbers, its huge table, its massive chairs and cavernous hearth; to
show himself to them in his suit from Milan, his town shoes; to show
them what he had become; a man on the rungs of a skilled professional
career, educated, self-assured. And yet also half-afraid. Of what?
Nothing. He could imagine the clamour of welcome. Even old Giovanni
would welcome him, the cuffs, the beatings, the brutalities and the
last quarrel forgotten.
   <p>Ginevra would surely be married now. Perhaps she would have
children. Would she have called one of them Ettore? Whom would she
have married? One of the Crespi? Not very likely. And yet who else
had there been for her to marry? Perhaps she had healed the
century-old vendetta between the families. He tried to be pleased at
the idea.
   <p>The bus hammered to a stop. He was the only passenger to get
down. A few men were sitting in the caf&eacute; opposite, but it was
already half-dark and no one recognized him. He walked very quickly
up the street, into the familiar lane, to the wide, double doors set
in the fortress-thickness of the courtyard wall. He found that his
heart was beating fast, and his mouth was dry.
   <p>Then he heard old footsteps shuffling across the courtyard, an
old voice grumbling, the leaf of the great door swinging open with a
whine of hinges. He recognized one of the servants who had been there
in his time: Franca, who had been old then, and seemed no older now,
as thin as a stick in her widow's black that she had worn for forty
years.
   <p>She stared at him.
   <p><quote>Franca,</quote> he said. <quote>It's me. Ettore Orfano. Don't you
remember?</quote>
   <p><quote>Madonna mia,</quote> she whispered. <quote>Ettore...</quote> Suddenly
she ran back towards the house as if possessed, shrieking at the top
of her voice, <quote>Ettore Orfano, little Ettore; he has come back!
Ginevra, Signora Angela... Maria!</quote>
   <p>He followed her, laughing, and at the same time scarcely able to
breathe for the thudding of his heart, the tightness in his throat.
And then she was in the doorway, looking at him, grown very tall and
slender, her face ivory pale, her dark eyebrows frowning a little,
looking at him among the shadows of the courtyard. Until suddenly her
hand went out to him, her eyes lighting, her remembered voice saying,
<quote>Ettore! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome home!</quote>
   <p>He took her hands, and looked at her from head to foot, while his
fingers felt to see what rings she wore. No wedding ring. And he was
absurdly glad, and then angry with himself.
   <p>He noticed that she was wearing black.
   <p><quote>You are in mourning?</quote> he said. She was already drawing him
into the kitchen.
   <p><quote>For my father</quote>, Ginevra said. <quote>He died a month ago. A fall
on the mountain.</quote>
   <p><quote>May God rest his soul,</quote> Ettore said. <quote>I am very sorry. I
would not have come &mdash; </quote>
   <p>From inside the kitchen, Ginevra's mother caught the last words,
grasped his arms and shook her head at him in rebuke.
   <p><quote>Would not have come?</quote> she exclaimed. <quote>You have kept us
waiting too long as it is. How long will you stay? Where have you...
oh, how fine you have grown, how tall! Eh, Ginevra &mdash; eh, Maria?</quote>
   <p>She seemed not to remember how he had left; only to be glad to
see him again. She had changed, Ettore saw. In the old days she had
been harsh and stiff; afraid of her husband and yet arrogantly proud
that she had a husband strong and fierce enough to make her afraid.
Now all that seemed gone. She seemed to have shrunk, and to have
lost all the certainties that once held her upright.
   <p><quote>And Silvio?</quote> Ettore asked, looking round for him.
   <p>A silence fell on the kitchen. Ginevra looked down, avoiding his
eyes. <quote>He is... he is away,</quote> she said, and immediately began a
great bustle of laying a place for Ettore, of giving orders to Maria
the cook, of fetching wine.
   <p>No one mentioned Silvio again all through the meal. And when
Ettore asked exactly how old Giovanni had died, the same silence fell,
as if there were things about the death that they were unwilling to
discuss, or that made them afraid.

<head>He Got What She Wanted</head>
<head>by NIGEL MORLAND</head>
   <p>He was haunted by an Income-Tax man &mdash; and She by Desire.
   <p>THE years have passed at times like beads told by ancient
fumbling fingers; in other moods I have seen those years race, tearing
out of my uncertain grasp, leaving me with a sense of time laughing at
me.
   <p>But Time in its flight has no pity, nor have the skies mercy. I
have tried to flee my twin devils only to see them running at my side,
pacing me with nonchalant disinterest, neither mocking nor savage,
just there. They stay, impalpable, inflexible, constant, yet beyond
reach as a man's shadow.
   <p>And when did it actually start? The first frail tendons of
misery wrapped round me unseen tentacles as tenuous as the first
shoots of a malignant tumour which remains unknown... and triumphant
on the day the surgeon's knife finds it and is defeated by it. It
grew round me like that, sheltering in my sense of shame, overwhelming
me until I could do nothing, bringing with it a resurgent second
devil, one I thought I had lost. A monstrous towering pair, the
hunger and the thirst, the unfilled, the unslaked...
   <p>But autobiography is apt to run amok with a writer's sense of
drama, for I am, indeed, a writer by trade: were I on my death-bed, as
well I might be, my pen would record the moments as the
self-experimental researcher notes his symptoms. Writing is surely
nothing but the tape recorder of its creator. He might hide, with
thin furtiveness, behind the hedge of fiction, yet, nevertheless, all
writing is merely the writer playing to the audience of himself,
abject before the rowdy despot of the subconscious mind.
   <p>I write because I must, write as Dr. Jekyll might have written
when Mr. Hyde was absent. But I have no doubts of my closeness to
my Mr. Hyde. I am both a human being and the devil's cherished,
indissolvably one in an unending oneness.
   <p>When I look round and see my friends, such as they are, and when
I think on  them I am lost in a sense of wonder. They see me
as I see myself now in the mirror on the far side of this table at
which I am writing.
   <p>Ordinary? Indeed so. A slightly built man of medium height;
slim, rather feminine hands, small feet and good bones. My face is
simply that, the epitome of John Doe: quiet blue eyes, dark hair and
what the nice-minded call pleasing features. A man, a passable,
civilised, modest man of perhaps forty. Obviously cleanly; obviously
of good parentage and of good education. Those who attend to my wants
call me <squote>sir</squote> and I treat them fairly; head waiters are polite to
me.
   <p>My friends see all that in me, too. <quote>Frank Damon?</quote> so they
would answer an enquiry, <quote>old Frank? Lord, yes, a nice chap. Quiet,
you know. Good company over a drink and a useful man at bridge and
tennis. Writes, you know</quote> &mdash; here that inevitable apologetic English
chuckle &mdash; <quote>and good at political stuff. Thrillers as well.</quote> Here
the amused smiles. <quote>Never read the things myself, of course! But
they must be good. He makes money.</quote>
   <p>Old Frank, and I look in the mirror at old Frank, one invisible
devil on each shoulder.
   <p>I always did like political science, but thrillers pay, not that
I really need it. I use a pseudonym, John Laker Considine (carefully
chosen, that &mdash; Carr, Chandler, Charteris, Cheyney, Christie; and
Considine fits neatly in the middle on the shelves, picking up some
reflected glory). You know my characters? Dr. Malobo? The Red
Aces of Justice? Rafferty of Scotland Yard? Colourful stuff, wild,
and perhaps melodramatic, but impervious to my devils.
   <p>John Laker Considine and his bright jackets. Poor old shadow!
Piling up wilderness of escapism for those who would flee themselves.
And behind this veritable escapist stands his alter ego, the
substantial presence of Frank Damon, old Frank, the nice chap who
would give everything in his world, unto the clothes he wears, to
become John Laker Considine who dwells in his one-dimensioned
pseudonymous world.
   <p>Out of the windows of my gracious study I can look across my
small garden, backing on this house my family left me, and becoming
Hyde Park. On the other side, the front of the house, is the rear of
Knightsbridge. A noble and valuable house, big for a solitary man,
and one that I love.
   <p>However, I digress. With my ballpoint in my hand and my thoughts
arrayed, my greater morbidities shrink back though they do not leave
me entirely, even with the spring brightness of Hyde Park to delight
my eyes.
   <p>Brightness in Nature in no way detracts from my devils. The one,
the older one, I endured and continue to endure though its
continuation shocked me; the second devil came on me a year after
Dunkirk, over a decade ago; it was the more awful of the pair.
Fortunately it was in London in the chaos of war with bombs turning
civic life to ruin. I was able to disappear, for money I had and I
was able to buy oblivion and secrecy.
   <p>That second devil came on me so stealthily that I did not believe
it at first; then I shrank back affrighted, crushed, nauseated. I had
to bear it alone &mdash; and it is only now, thinking on it all, that I
understand how the leper must feel.
   <p>My mother and father died before the Second World War broke out;
they left me this house in which I have returned to live again, and
they left me money. Writing I took up as a release from myself, and
as a means to power without visibility &mdash; a purely morbid passion!
   <p>Yet I always require anonymity. That is easily found in London.
The world and the people I knew before Dunkirk went with those same
tides of war which washed smooth the sands of my acquaintance,
enabling me to start again.
   <p>So, too, went Mary Damon. The world had no need to recall her at
all, for those same tides had washed her away as well. But this
little man must come enquiring. A troublesome little man, seemingly
as harmless as a fly on the wall: brownish &mdash; hair, skin, eyes &mdash; and
slight. Not young, and sadly dressed, with fraying cuff edges and a
dusty old hat, a man you could see with a cake and a glass of milk in
a cheap restaurant, a man no one would ever notice, wholly a human
zero except, perhaps, in his name &mdash; Arthur George Zink.
   <p>He was here last week, enquiring so mildly, blinking at me from
behind his thick spectacles, affable, self-effacing, desiring not to
trouble me, enquiring for Mary Damon, apologising for bothering me,
gentle, kindly Arthur George Zink &mdash; as weakly persistent as a dripping
tap, so damnably, politely, endlessly persistent!
   <p>I see the tremendous juggernauts of bureaucracy hauled by
regiments of Arthur George Zinks, little men and even little women at
their eternal writing, making their entries, adding their sums,
putting one and one together, until a total must emerge. And asking
questions, unavoidable questions, persistently, persistently...
   <p>
   <p>The inspector's glare was ferocious.
   <p><quote>You think that, sir?</quote> He put both hands on the desk, leaning
forward to tower over the plump amiability of Superintendent Leeds.
<quote>It's the fifth one &mdash; don't forget it.</quote>
   <p>Leeds beamed at Detective-Inspector Chater. Because they had
become friends when they met as uniformed probationers on their two
basic years, they usually forgot rank when alone.
   <p><quote>You're letting the thing infuriate you, Tom &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Chater threw up his arms and sat down, placated by the use of his
Christian name.
   <p><quote>Naturally I'm a trifle distrait.</quote> He glared. <quote>Five
kidnappings and five kids returned without a hair of their dear little
heads being harmed, without a single mother screaming blue murder
after the first knowledge of the thing &mdash;</quote> Chater jerked a thumb to
indicate all New Scotland Yard. <quote>The pundits must be delighted.</quote>
   <p><quote>They are indeed.</quote> Leeds flapped his hands at the lean black
Highland fury of his friend. <quote>But I'm your super, old boy. Won't
the mothers say a thing? You can tell me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Tush! Compounding, dammit! And do they care?</quote> Chater
sniffed. <quote>Ach! And how can I move? I can't even prove they've paid
or how much or where. Women!</quote>
   <p><quote>Kids all right, I s'pose?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've got my methods in finding out. Aye, they're bonny.
Clean, well-fed, cared for, happy as Larry. I've known a few
kidnappings but none like this.</quote>
   <p><quote>And why won't the mothers talk? What's behind it? Can't you
get one of the Yanks to come across and help us? They're used to the
snatch racket.</quote>
   <p>Leeds grimaced.
   <p><quote>Now, Tom. We're in a cleft stick, you know it. Nobody's
complained, at least the complaints've been withdrawn as soon as made.
We can't prove anything, or even how the money passed &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>There's such a thing as compounding &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Be quiet, Tom. It'd be a hellish charge to get across in
court. Can you see the Attorney-General's face if he was asked to
support a charge against a mother for compounding when her child has
been kidnapped and she wanted it back?</quote> Leeds leaned forward.
<quote>Tom, get the bastard, will you? Apart from everything else, it's a
dirty business.</quote>
   <p>Chater snorted irately.
   <p>
   <p>But this is not work. I have the newest adventure of Dr.
Malobar to finish, a matter of ten thousand words, yet I find essays
at autobiography so fascinating, the ancient principle of confession
being good for the soul!
   <p>It may be. It is also a minor antidote to devils. I am feeling
clearer in mind, more comfortable. There is the Malobar manuscript to
fetch. I am old-fashioned in that I write in longhand, for my mind
constructs and perfects the next sentence while I am still writing.
The folder of manuscript lives in the built-in cupboard in the
bedroom, for no sensible reason.
   <p>When I opened the door and bent to pick up the folder, a wave of
nostalgia swept over me. Not for months had it happened. Perhaps the
spring air intensified the deep scent of gardenia, that
well-remembered scent.
   <p>All carefully preserved, hanging there, the outer world of Mary
Damon... there was the coral taffeta with the full skirt, the brown
check suit &mdash; a costly article &mdash; bought in Bond Street, and the ivory
satin cloak that had gone to all the best theatres in London. There
was the fur coat &mdash; Persian lamb, a most expensive thing, costly, too,
but I saw it as hateful, for only the other day I read of what happens
to those small lambs... I touched garment after garment, each
fashioned article had a memory a decade old, a story, an appeal, and
each reached out to me, disturbing me, hurting &mdash; me, a man, a writer
of bloodthirsty tales, John Laker Considine, no less!
   <p>But the requested Danegeld was paid in the coinage of uneasy
recollection which memory demanded. I was a fool, a thrice damned
fool to keep these things here, a stupid danger in their way, yet I
could do nothing, could not get rid of them any more than could a
mother throw away the relics of a dead child.
<head>Five children kidnapped &mdash; and no clue to the guilty</head>
   <p>Then it began worrying me again, that probing little man, that
subtle and insinuating Zink. A wholly absurd name which comes
dangerously close to Mary... God forbid that he can disinter her, yet
in a most shocking sense he can do that if he comes too close, and
then?
   <p>These morbid thoughts did not help me. I thrust the pen at the
paper, back again at my table, and thought of Dr. Malobar, <squote>The
tall man with the dramatic green eyes seemed to tower over the whole
room, a growing domination of terror.</squote> There it stopped, a hiatus
which remained.
   <p>It was no use trying; I could not write. That brownish little
man of the frayed cuffs and the dusty hat would not leave my mind.

<head>LARSEN'S LAST HAUL</head>
   <p><quote>Lucky</quote> Larsen, the ruthless skipper of the Arctic trawler
<quote>Volsung</quote>, did not believe in Hell hereafter. He only believed in
the immediate hell of his savage way of life... by George
Goldsmith-Carter
   <p>THE ARCTIC TRAWLER Volsung laboured heavily at her trawl
in the looping ground-swell to the west nor' west of Andenes
lighthouse, flashing feebly against the sleet-blurred, rocky backdrop
of the coast of North West Norway.
   <p>Above the tiny vessel the Northern Lights rippled in green,
barbaric radiance across a sable, freezing sky. Beneath her restless
keel rolled water which, glacial blue in the few hours of half light
yet to come, was now black and bitter as death.
   <p>The massive bulk of <quote>LUCKY</quote> LARSEN, skipper of the
Volsung, loomed in the open window of the wheelhouse, from whence
he stood watching, heedless of the gathering rime of frost which
glittered on the red stubble of his heavy jaw. He looked across the
dark sea to where the tip of the new moon was thrusting like a silver
dagger from behind the shark-toothed peaks of Andoy, then his wolfish
eyes shifted to the fish-pounds in the fore-deck beneath him.
Illuminated by the glare of the deck lights a dozen men were toiling,
their oilskinned backs hunched against the bite of the searing wind
which glazed the ship with ice. Those men had been on their feet for
seventy hours now, labouring without a break, and, half blind and
savage with exhaustion, they were reduced almost to the level of
beasts. Men driven beyond endurance by the silent menace of the
watcher above to shoot and haul the giant net, to gut and pack the
torrent of bronze-backed haddock which shimmered endlessly inboard,
and curse the cooks if the mugs of strong and scalding tea were not
forthcoming.
   <p>Larsen's <quote>Luck</quote> lay in his inherited ability to find the
roving fish shoals when others could not and having found them, harry
his crew without mercy until the fish holds were full. Yet in spite
of his reputation men still joined his ship to share the wealth he
found, knowing that in the finding he would break their bodies and
their spirits, driving them with flaying tongue and fist until the
voyage was made. Then when at last the hatches were battened down,
they would reel below to drop exhausted in their reeking clothes,
lying like corpses where they fell.
   <p>The crew of the Volsung had almost reached that point now,
for their bloodshot eyes were glazed with exhaustion and the blank
look of sleep walkers was on their scale and slime masked faces as
they toiled unceasingly amid the slaughter of the fish-pounds.
   <p>There was comprehension but no pity on Larsen's face as he
bleakly watched his crew, for he knew that there was no room for pity
in this way of life. A few hours back a young deck-hand on his first
trip had stumbled up to him, his frost-ravaged, bleeding hands held
out in supplication. <quote>For the love of God, skipper, I just can't
carry on!</quote> he had cried. With bitter and contemptuous words Larsen
had ordered him below to help the cook, telling him that thereafter he
would receive no pay.
   <p>Larsen's restless gaze swept to the fish-gutters, their inflamed
and toil-swollen wrists swathed in old rags to ease the abrasion of
the sand spilling from the bellies of the fish which they were ripping
open. The gutting knives flashed ceaselessly, in at the vent, out at
the gills. Like automatons the men worked, flinging the livers into
baskets for rendering into fish-oil, tossing the entrails overboard in
an endless stream.
   <p>Larsen's frost-blackened lips curved cynically as he watched the
screaming horde of sea-fowl swooping avidly at the offal which
encircled his ship. All about him gleamed the fishing lights of many
nationalities. He knew that each trawler, like his own, was emptying
the sea of fish, destroying unborn life and fouling the sea with an
endless torrent of filth. With savage irony men had called this
mighty gathering of fishing craft <quote>The League of Nations</quote>, for the
trawlers fished in bitter rivalry, the larger vessels ruthlessly
thrusting the smaller ones from where the haddock shoaled the
thickest. One thing alone Larsen knew these raiders had in common &mdash; a
blind rapacity which chose to disregard the barren future of the seas.
Yet this heedless rapine meant nothing to him, for in his
grandfather's day men had thus plundered the North Sea. <quote>The
Gamecocks</quote>, <quote>The Short Blues</quote> and other great fleets of rival
sailing trawlers had swept bare the Dogger Bank, denuded the fabulous
<quote>Silver Pits</quote>, looted the fishy gold of the California Grounds.
Then with the North Sea almost barren they had turned to the west,
scouring away the Lemon soles of Cornwall's Klondyke Ground.
   <p>In his own time the Spanish trawlers had pillaged, almost
overnight, the silver hake of southern Irish waters, ruining Milford
Haven, once the chief hake port of the world. Then with home waters a
desolation, a new type of trawler had appeared. The powerful <quote>High
Altitude</quote> trawlers which now ravaged the bitter waters of Bear
Island and Nova Zembla; the plaice abounding shallows of the White
Sea; the cod-rich Icelandic Banks &mdash; and these haddock-teeming
Norwegian Deeps.
   <p><quote>The Wall of Death</quote> some called the place, a grim spot where
the Continental Shelf swooped steeply from the surf smashed rocks of
the shore, ending in a submerged precipice which plunged twelve
thousand feet into the Oceanic depths beneath. Against this
deep-drowned cliff the gale-driven surges of the Arctic Ocean beat in
elemental malice, creating a maelstrom which was death to ships and
men.
   <p>Yet Larsen knew no pity for the dead whose bones lay far beneath
him, he knew only the law of the Northern Trawl, <quote>The weak perish
but the strong survive.</quote> Nor did he heed the fools who believed
these water  haunted by ghost ships with the earth-bound
spirits of their crews doomed forever to endure the torment of their
earthly memories and re-enact in endless ghostly parody the last
moments of their lives. He smiled sardonically to himself, for he
knew that there was no hell hereafter. Reason told him that nothing
but oblivion, blacker and deeper than the depths beneath him, lay
beyond this hell that men called <quote>life</quote>.
   <p>Leaving the wheelhouse, Larsen glanced astern to where the wire
trawl-warps twanged and quivered away into the heaving night. <quote>Get
some weight on that after warp, bos'un!</quote> he bellowed. Going back
into the wheelhouse he scanned the echometer, <quote>Watch your steering,
blast you!</quote> he growled at the weary helmsman <quote>You're wandering
over the edge.</quote>
   <p>Tonight the haddock were shoaling massively in three hundred
fathoms, along the very edge of <quote>The Wall of Death</quote>. A little to
the westward of this sounding lay an abyss of eighteen hundred
fathoms, beyond the reach of any trawl and the haunt of alien species.
Here swam the snake-like Cyclothones, the rat-tailed Chimerae, the
swag-bellied Oceanic Angler fishes, useless monstrosities, armoured
against the cold depths with incredible slime and carrying their own
weird luminosity to light their mindless gropings in awful pressure
and a blackness beyond night. Larsen was not interested in marine
biology, only in profit.
   <p>The mate came into the wheelhouse. He was a young man whose eyes
were black holes of fatigue burned into his thin, dirty face. The
scarred and broken nailed fingers of his left hand were locked in the
handles of two grime-streaked mugs of tea, whilst his right hand
steadied him against the uneasy lurching of the ship.
   <p><quote>Have a mug o' lotion, skipper,</quote> he said hoarsely. Larsen
gulped the lye-strong, scalding fluid then rasped <quote>How are the
men?</quote>
   <p>The mate shrugged, knowing well that Larsen's concern was not
with the crew's welfare, merely with their ability to continue
working. <quote>They say that they're spragged, skipper, and that whether
you like it or not, they're stopping for a kip.</quote>
   <p>Larsen leaned out from the wheelhouse window, his out-thrust face
like that of a gargoyle <quote>Which of you... is stopping for a sleep?</quote>
His voice was hardly raised but it seemed to bite into the very
ice-bound fabric of the plunging ship. The men beneath him raised
their haggard faces and though dull hatred glimmered in their clouded
eyes, none spoke.
   <p><quote>Come on my lads</quote> he chided softly, a thick vein hammering in
his corded throat <quote>Who wants to sleep?... don't be afraid. Speak
up.</quote>
   <p>When nobody answered him he nodded as if satisfied <quote>Good. Any
more of that talk and I'll be down amongst you...</quote> his voice cracked
suddenly like a whip <quote>Now get back to work you ...s!</quote>
   <p>For a moment he watched them go, trying to flog the life back
into their frozen limbs. Then he spoke to the mate. <quote>How does the
fish tally stand?</quote>
   <p><quote>Fifty thousand stone of haddock, skipper. The holds are
full... a record catch.</quote>
   <p>Larsen's bitter face showed no jubilation <quote>This next haul will
be our last. That's all.</quote>
   <p>When the mate had gone Larsen went back to the open window, where
oblivious to the slashing, needle-pointed sleet, he stood with his
powerful legs braced against the motion of the ship. For an eternity,
it seemed he'd been at strife with the elements and at strife with
men. With axes and steam horses he had fought the creeping Black
Frosts which had tried to burden his ship with their deadly weight of
ice. With brain and furious strength he had fought the giant seas
which had licked men away like flies and threatened to engulf him.
With cruel fists and crueller words he had cowed crews made mutinous
by wicked overwork.
   <p>But memories he could not cow. They crept into his mind at
unguarded moments. He remembered the day on the Rockall Bank when he
had heaved down on the winch to free the trawl which was fast to some
obstruction two hundred fathoms down. The net had not come free and
he had heaved down like a madman, in spite of the lurching ship and
frightened glances of his men. He had heaved until the water lapped
the rail. Heaved until a massive iron bollard had exploded like a
bomb and the trawl-warp flailing clear of its captivity, had scythed
away a man's head. He remembered how the decapitated body had taken
three dreadful steps before it fell.
   <p>He remembered, too, the night off North Cape when only he had
dared fish whilst other craft lay hove-to for their lives in the
hurricane wind and giant seas. The ton-weight otter board of the net
had ripped free of its dog-chain and swinging inboard from the
fore-gallows, had crushed the boatswain to a pulp. Yet men called him
<quote>Lucky</quote> &mdash; a man whose wife, overwhelmed by loneliness, had left
him. A father whose grown children had long since become as strangers
to him.
   <p>In the tiny radio cabin behind the wheelhouse the radio operator
had switched on the receiver and a babel of voices and tongues broke
in on Larsen's thoughts. The skippers of many nations were asking for
instructions from their company offices; some were rejoicing in their
run of luck; others blasphemously cursing it. One voice was drowning
all the others with its ire. <quote>Lost all my nets but one and that's
ripped to doll rags... all for the sake of a lousy two hundred boxes
of fish. Won't clear my expenses! Over and out. Gone me...</quote>
   <p>A look of contemptuous amusement came to Larsen's face. He knew
the owner of that rancorous voice, it belonged to the skipper of the
trawler Valkyrie... DAN SCARDEN, a man known for his bitter
complaints.
   <p>Going into the radio cabin Larsen switched on the transmitter and
called <quote>Volsung to Valkyrie, Volsung to Valkyrie. D'ye
hear me Dan?... over.</quote>
   <p>He waited for an answer but none came.
   <p>Tapping the speaker in his hand Larsen called <quote>Volsung to
Valkyrie, Volsung to Valkyrie. Need a hearing aid, Dan? For
god's sake stop chafing and start fishing...</quote> he grinned maliciously
<quote>you can have a couple of my spare nets.

<head>Begins today: dramatic story of a Scots girl sold as a slave</head>
<head>A GIFT FOR THE SULTAN</head>
   <p>THAT Scottish autumn of 1767 was a cold one. Ice rarely melted
in the rutted country lanes, and the fields and hills were permanently
blanketed in thick, white frost. Winter would come early and stay
long, and in a country poverty-stricken since the disastrous uprising,
the prospect was grim indeed.
   <p>With strange English landlords usurping their chieftains' seats,
the scattered clansmen were gradually deprived of home and hope.
Sheep were a paying proposition, men were not, so the new
<quote>lairds</quote> wanted land. By paying starvation prices for their
tenants' crops, and cruelly raising the cost of food and fuel and
rents, they got it.
   <p>Faced with eviction and worse, men despairing of their children's
future turned in their thousands to the bright New World that beckoned
from across the sea. It was heartbreaking to go, but worse to stay,
and soon every district had its share of deserted cottages and crofts.
   <p>Even in the tiny Aberdeenshire village of Mill o' Steps there
were smokeless chimneys and blank, unlighted doorways. But the
windows of the blacksmith's cottage on that cold September night
glowed warm and welcoming. In the living-room a blazing peat fire lit
up the red-gold hair of a young girl who stirred an iron soup-kettle
at the enormous hearth.
   <p>She was listening with more amusement than respect to the old
woman who sat hunched beside her, staring into the flames.
   <p><quote>You can laugh, my girl,</quote> the other reproved her. <quote>But the
day will come when you'll remember what I tell you now. You'll stand
where eagles fly &mdash;</quote>
   <p>From the scullery there came a sudden angry snort, and an
irritable voice called: <quote>Will you stop this nonsense at once, Morag
Paterson?</quote>
   <p>But the woman at the fire ignored her, and pressed on
unperturbed in her droning sing-song voice.
   <p><quote>You'll stand where no woman ever stood &mdash; and be in mortal
danger for it. And all about you there'll be cruelty undreamed of,
and those who would kill you if they could. But there's love
undreamed of for you, too, and some who'll live to serve you and die
to prove it. You'll walk with a man beside you that men bow down
to &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Mistress Paterson!</quote> the girl protested laughingly.
   <p>But the other nodded her head solemnly. <quote>Aye, it's the truth.
And you'll be so high and mighty &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>She's that already!</quote> The exasperated speaker appeared in the
doorway. <quote>Will you stop filling her head with such blether?</quote> she
demanded.
   <p><quote>Blether, is it, Jessie Gloag?</quote> retorted the other, stung.
<quote>And who was it sent for me to come and say what lies ahead?
Blether, indeed!</quote>
   <p>She turned to stare into the fire again.
   <p>Quietly she said: <quote>Nay, but it's true. She'll wear silks and
laces and ride where others will walk, and we that hear of it will
marvel at what comes to pass.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>THE girl beside her laughed again, her green eyes dancing
in the firelight.
   <p><quote>Och, Mistress Paterson &mdash; you should be telling fortunes at a
fair!</quote> she teased. <quote>It's rich you'd soon be, with such fine fates
for the asking!</quote>
   <p>Old Morag shrugged, but before she could say more the woman she
called Jessie turned on the younger one.
   <p><quote>What ails you, girl?</quote> she snapped. <quote>Himself will be in this
instant and never a drop of hot water to be had. Will you fetch the
bucket at once!</quote>
   <p>With a toss of her head, the girl flounced past her.
   <p><quote>Say <squote>if you please</squote> and I'll maybe send you a jewel from my
crown,</quote> she mocked and went, slamming the door behind her.
   <p>Jessie's face darkened and the older woman eyed her shrewdly.
   <p><quote>Don't be so hard on the lass, Jessie. It's envy that ails
you &mdash; envy that your man had a child by the wife before you. But
there'll be sons for you &mdash; aye, and happiness, too &mdash; when Helen's gone
from your sight.</quote> She sighed and turned back to the fire. <quote>And
that will be much sooner than you're thinking.</quote>
   <p><quote>It'll not come soon enough for me,</quote> retorted the other
ungraciously, and turned as Helen entered to berate her for leaving
the outside door ajar.
   <p><quote>I left it for himself,</quote> the girl replied, her manner suddenly
oddly subdued. <quote>He and Uncle Donald are just coming.</quote>
   <p>She had moved the soup-kettle to one side and now began to fill
the cauldron on the hob. But at the sound of footsteps on the path
outside she half turned to the doorway, slopping the water badly as
she did so.
   <p><quote>Land sakes, will you look what you're about!</quote> her irate
stepmother exploded, as Andrew Gloag entered the room.
   <p><quote>Och, hold your whisht, woman,</quote> he said irritably. <quote>We'll
have none of you scowls and scolds on my brother's last night with his
family.</quote>
   <p>Flushing, she turned on him. But before she could retort, she
saw him slump heavily into a chair, and there was something in his
attitude that silenced her.
   <p>Watching him from the fireside, Helen was suddenly wildly elated.
Forcing herself to be calm, she set the bucket down carefully and
then stood to face him, her hands pressed together to still their
trembling.
   <p>For a long moment he sat silent and she glanced nervously at the
young man who had followed him in. Reassured by his nod, she waited
to meet her father's gaze, steeling herself against the remorse she
knew she would feel at hurting him.
   <p>
   <p>AT last, with a shake of his head, Andrew raised his eyes
to hers.
   <p><quote>It's really what you want, lass?</quote> he said quietly. And,
seeing the answer so clearly in her face, added in the same tone:
<quote>Then that will be the way of it.</quote>
   <p><quote>America!</quote> she breathed, and for a moment could not make
herself consider how her delight must wound him, compunction killed by
the realisation of a thousand dreams.
   <p><quote>You're sure you know what you're about, lass?</quote> he said,
eyeing her searchingly. <quote>Turning your back on all you've ever
known &mdash; have you thought you'll likely never see your family or
friends again?</quote>
   <p><quote>I know it all, father. But I must go &mdash; I must go!</quote>
   <p>He sighed heavily. <quote>And you will leave with Donald in the
morning?</quote>
   <p><quote>If you will let me.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>FOR Jessie, this sudden turn of events seemed too good to
be true. But as she saw the dispirited sag of her husband's shoulders
she forced herself to speak to Helen.
   <p><quote>You've no call to be leaving home,</quote> she said, and flushed as
she added, <quote>if it's ought that I've said or done &mdash;</quote>
   <p>But old Morag cut across her words.
   <p><quote>The kitchen's not been built that will hold two women &mdash; it's
not your fault or the lass's. And don't you glare at me, Andrew
Gloag! Your girl is seventeen and she'd be away from home soon
enough, one way or the other.</quote>
   <p>Donald spoke for the first time. <quote>She'll take no harm with me,
Andrew. I'm sure you know it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Och, man, don't speak of it,</quote> his brother answered.
   <p>With an effort he smiled, and it broke the tension. Helen
crossed to him and, in a rare show of affection, bent to kiss his
cheek.
   <p><quote>Uncle Donald must have someone to cook and clean and keep house
for him,</quote> she said eagerly. <quote>And maybe he'll make a fine fortune
and marry &mdash; and then he can buy me a passage to come back to see
you.</quote>
   <p>She glanced hopefully at Morag, expecting support. But the old
woman turned again to stare into the fire.
   <p><quote>All that's as maybe,</quote> she said flatly. <quote>But you'll not
change what's to come, though you talk till you drop. You'll follow
the path that's been laid for you &mdash; aye, and Donald will follow
his.</quote>
   <p>Sleep was a long time coming to Helen that night. There had been
so much to talk about, so much to plan. It was only when she was
alone at last in the curtained comfort of her wall cot that she could
think at all clearly.
   <p>She had grown up in the knowledge that a large part of her
father's fondness for her was on account of her remarkable likeness to
the mother she had hardly known. Now she suddenly saw that her
absence might well be the best thing for them all.
   <p>She had been touched and troubled by Jessie's obvious effort at
conciliation, and knew it for what it was &mdash; a gesture of
self-sacrifice for the man she loved. The evening's excitement seemed
somehow to have brought a sharper awareness of her own thoughts and
emotions, and now, ashamed, she realised that she had never before
given a moment's consideration to Jessie's.
   <p>It could not have been easy to try to take the place of an adored
memory. And with a spoiled child to contend with as well, it must
have seemed an almost hopeless task. She flushed suddenly in the
darkness, remembering the times without number when she had
deliberately scored off the young stepmother, childishly flaunting her
ability to wheedle all she wanted from her doting father.
   <p>She could see again Jessie's odd, strained expression at such
times &mdash; and suddenly she recalled another face, another expression,
and her cheeks grew even hotter. Uncle Donald.
   <p>
   <p>SEVERAL times in recent weeks she had caught his
thoughtful, measuring gaze on her after some sharp exchange between
herself and Jessie, and now she suddenly knew without any doubt that
this was his reason for taking her away. Not because he needed her or
particularly wanted her company, but because he thought the situation
unfair to Jessie.
   <p>It was Jessie who awakened her in the morning &mdash; a strangely
different, quieter Jessie.
   <p>For the moment, they were alone: the two men were over at the
smithy and old Morag was washing at the pump in the yard.
   <p>In the light of her new understanding, Helen would have dearly
liked to take advantage of the moment and wipe out all past trouble
between them. But in her inexperience she found it difficult even to
act at all naturally.
   <p>Then Jessie placed a bowl of porridge on the table and pushed
Helen's own horn spoon towards it, and this small courtesy undid them
both.
   <p>After mumbling her thanks, the younger woman sat red-faced and
unmoving until the other suddenly said in a tired voice: <quote>I've not
been much of a mother to you, Helen. You'd not be wanting to go away
from your home if I had.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's not that,</quote> Helen said lamely, then tried again: <quote>I've
not been much of a daughter to you, come to that.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>JESSIE appeared not to have heard.
   <p><quote>I meant to be, dear knows. There were plenty to say I'd rue
the day, but I wouldn't listen. So certain sure I was that God had
put me here on earth to care for Andrew Gloag and his child that
nobody could tell me different. And now just look what it's come
to!</quote>
   <p>She sat down suddenly and faced Helen across the table.
   <p><quote>You'll break his heart if you go, you know that?</quote>
   <p>Helen shook her head, all uncertainty amazingly gone.
   <p><quote>No. I thought about it, last night. I think it's best for
everybody.</quote>
   <p>As Jessie looked at her oddly, she hurried on: <quote>I realised a
lot of things, last night. Things I should have thought of sooner.</quote>
   <p>Embarrassed, she said: <quote>I was thinking, you couldn't have been
much above my age when &mdash; when you &mdash;</quote>
   <p>She broke off. She could not have said <quote>married my father</quote>
for the life of her. She knew what marriage entailed, and only now
did it occur to her that there could have been little of true marriage
between Andrew Gloag and his second wife.
   <p><quote>I was sixteen,</quote> said Jessie, quietly.
   <p><quote>Sixteen!</quote> Helen repeated, startled.
   <p>From the doorway, old Morag said: <quote>Aye, but she'll not be
twice that before she's bouncing her first-born on her knee.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't talk so daft, woman!</quote> Jessie said, with a return of her
old spirit.

<head>THE GUN</head>
<head>BY HARRY RICHMAN</head>
<head>A very short story that is not what it seems</head>
   <p>GINO stopped pacing the floor and walked over to the
sideboard. Gently, he pulled open the middle drawer and stared at the
huge black Luger that was once his father's, lying serenely in the
farthest corner. Still without a sound, he closed his huge brown hand
over the cold steel, and hastily transferred it to his jacket pocket.
A few seconds later his wife walked into the room.
   <p><squote>Gino, what are you doing?</squote>
   <p><squote>Nothing! &mdash; Thinking.</squote> He walked away from the drawer and
put his hands in his pockets to stop them from trembling.
   <p><squote>Why you no think about getting the work?</squote> She wiped her
hands on a dirty apron. <squote>Thinking &mdash; walking up &mdash; down... No food
in the house, what you think about that, huh? You gotta any plans
about that? We'd be better if we stay in Viareggio.</squote> She wiped
an imaginary tear from her rosy cheek.
   <p><squote>You wanna go back to Viareggio &mdash; go! I no stop you. I stay
here. Go back if you wanna go. You think I no try and get the work,
huh? What you think &mdash; you think I no try?</squote>
   <p>Gino turned and stalked out of the house. A hard, loud slam of
the door stopped his wife's voluble Italian adjectives from following
him out.
   <p>
   <p>Ever since he'd lost his job two weeks ago, they'd done nothing
but squabble. He pulled out a cigarette packet and stared
disconsolately at the last Woodbine. He placed it carefully between
his lips and lit it. He winced as the empty packet landed in the
gutter. Food he could manage without for a few days, but
cigarettes... He inhaled deeply and kept the smoke inside of him for
as long as he could.
   <p>He walked all morning. In the afternoon it began to drizzle.
Gino pulled his jacket collar up high and for the umpteenth time
placed his hand on the Luger. He felt nervous and undecided. He
glanced up at a clock hanging over a jeweller's shop. It was four
o'clock &mdash; he had time. He decided to wait in a doorway for the rain
to stop. He wanted to think.
   <p>He wouldn't go back to Viareggio. If she wanted to go, let her.
He dug into his pocket for a cigarette, and was irritated when only a
box of matches came out. His irritation made him think about his
wife's mother: <squote>I don't let you to take my daughter to London. A
daughter's place is by her mother &mdash; you no right &mdash; you no right to
take my bambino away.</squote> She'd gone on and on, even when the train
moved off she was still shouting.
   <p>He wouldn't go back, no matter what. He ran his hand over the
gun and the anger he felt subsided slightly. He'd show her. He'd
show everybody.
   <p>Gino moved out of the doorway into the drizzle, that showed no
signs of stopping. It was four-thirty and plans had better be made.
His face was covered with thoughtful wrinkles as he walked steadily
forward.
   <p>
   <p>From time to time his deep concentration was floored by the aroma
of hot coffee from the many caf&eacute;s. The smells of fresh bread and
fried chicken caused his stomach to scream in anguish. Cigarette
smoke seemed to find his nose from all of a hundred different brands.
He dug his nails deeper into the palms of his hands, as his head
began to reel. Frantically he swallowed huge gulps of air and then
closed his eyes to help stop the buildings from going round and round.
   <p>In desperation, he branched off into an alley-way, and there,
breathing heavily, and by now almost wet through, he waited for peace
to return.
   <p>It was now five. Gino wiped his face and head with an old
handkerchief. It had stopped drizzling, and he was annoyed at having
allowed himself to be soaked. He squeezed the water from his
handkerchief and strode forward. His mind was made up.
   <p>He walked straight toward a little shop he had once seen in one
of the many side streets that ran like arteries off Soho's more public
thoroughfares. There were only a few people about. Some fifty yards
from the shop, he put his hand on the Luger and made it feel
comfortable.
   <p>An old woman stopped to look into the shop's windows. Gino
hesitated. The gun was heavy in his pocket. The whole left side of
his body seemed to feel the weight. The old lady went away.
   <p>Gino moistened his lips. He'd never done anything like this
before. He uttered a swift, silent prayer, finishing with <squote>dear
Father and Mother, please forgive me.</squote> His forehead was covered in
perspiration. He arrived at the door and stopped.
   <p>He couldn't go through with it. He was from a good family. The
name Farrari was known all over Italy. If the news ever got back
home &mdash; he shuddered.
   <p>He moved to the corner of the quiet little street and watched a
light come on in the small shop. <squote>Dear God,</squote> whispered Gino,
<squote>what shall I do?</squote> The gun was beginning to feel heavier and
heavier.
   <p>
   <p>Suddenly, he knew what he must do. His face grim, his demeanour
calm, he again walked forward. What did he care what anybody thought
or said! No one worried about him. Nobody cared. He stalked into
the shop and stopped three yards from the counter.
   <p>There were two men inside. The older one was putting something
away on a shelf. Gino put his hand on the gun and walked toward the
fat one, who was reading the evening paper.
   <p>With a short, jerky movement, he drew the Luger from his pocket.
His hand shook, and he felt sick with shame.
   <p><squote>How...,</squote> he put the gun on the counter, <squote>how much you
give me for this, please?</squote>
<head>COMMUNICATION</head>
   <p>Terror roared at his family out of the lonely night. But no
one could help him, in his agonising struggle to save them &mdash; and prove
himself.
<head>BY A. E. TREPPASS</head>
<head>Illustration by Bernard Blatch</head>

   <p>THE large illuminated sign at the road side etched its
message sharply in the cool darkness:
   <p>STOP &mdash; ONE HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD &mdash; FOR THE LAST CUP OF TEA FOR
MILES.
   <p>Charles Corran smiled and remembered the red brick caf&eacute; with
its rose garden and gravel car park. They had been tempted to stop
there at the beginning of their holiday. Now, late, on the way home,
he was more than tempted. Besides, just beyond the caf&eacute; lay the
twenty-mile long, lonely road across Rannet Moors; a wearisome
journey, particularly so late at night when all he wanted to do was
doze over the steering column.
   <p>He slowed the car and turned to Meg, his wife. In the half light
she looked tired and a little sad. It had been a good holiday and
they had all been reluctant to leave the sea and the sun.
   <p><squote>Shall we?</squote> he asked.
   <p>She nodded lazily and stirred in her seat, enough to glance at
the two children who were snuggled sleepily in the back.
   <p>Tony, who was five and precocious, opened his eyes and murmured:
   <p><squote>Shall we what, Daddy?</squote>
   <p><squote>Have a cup of tea,</squote> Meg replied.
   <p><squote>I want orange,</squote> Belle informed them, with all the authority
of her eleven years.
   <p><squote>With a straw,</squote> Tony added.
   <p><squote>Good.</squote> Charles signalled that he was turning left, and, at
the very moment he nosed into the caf&eacute; car park, there was a noise
beside them like an aero engine and two unsilenced motor cycles
carrying black, helmeted figures roared right across his path,
spraying gravel over his bonnet.
   <p>He braked instantly and the steering wheel hit his chest and he
gasped. Meg cried out as her head bumped the windscreen and Tony
began to sob on the floor.
   <p><squote>The devils! The fiendish devils!</squote> Meg snapped as she leant
over the back seat to help Belle gather Tony into her arms.
   <p>Charles said nothing. He realized he had heard the motorcycles
approaching and he knew they had had time to see his signal. He
waited until his family were settled, then he accelerated into the car
park. He caught the motorcycles and the riders in the full glare of
his headlights, braked and slipped purposefully out of the car.
   <p><squote>Don't!</squote> Meg pleaded, but he ignored her.
   <p>He had the acrid taste of fear in his mouth and his chest ached.
His legs were rubbery but he was angry. He pulled his tired body off
the rack of the long, weary drive from Dorset and clenched his fists.
   <p>The riders were standing beside their motorcycles waiting for
him. They were dressed from head to foot in black; black leggings,
boots, zipper jacket, goggles. Their manner was as insolent as the
startling white skull and crossbones on each black crash helmet.
   <p>They were young and Charles wanted to lash out at them.
   <p><squote>You maniacs!</squote> he snapped, and they stared at him.
   <p><squote>Turn the light out, Mister,</squote> the slighter one drawled. <squote>It
hurts my eyes.</squote>
   <p>
   <p>HE stood a yard away from them and tried to feel he was
towering over them, but they were as tall, or even taller than he.
   <p>He tried to control his fury and his hammering heart by taking a
deep, slow breath.
   <p><squote>You crazy lunatics,</squote> he said, and his voice sounded strange
and weak. <squote>You'll kill someone someday .</squote>
   <p>One of them laughed; a sharp, hysterical sound. The other spat.
   <p><squote>So what? As long as it isn't you why should you worry?</squote>
   <p>Charles stepped forward, incensed beyond reason. Instantly the
taller thrust his body forward and warned viciously:
   <p><squote>You touch me, mate and I'll call the cops.</squote>
   <p>Amazed, Charles hesitated, and the taller one sensed his
advantage. He flipped Charles' tie out, turned and caught his
companion's arm.
   <p><squote>C'mon, boy. Let's blow! Man, this fella's a drag!</squote>
   <p>Charles watched them strut into the doorway of the caf&eacute; and
realized his inadequacy. There was no way in which he could
communicate with them. They were in their own, arrogant, teenage
world; a world of curt questions and harsh answers, of sudden
irrational impulses; a world that had changed radically in the twenty
years since he had left it.
   <p>At the car he was faced with the silence of his family. He
sensed their fear, saw Meg's sharp, shadowed profile, saw Belle
sitting tense, wide awake, her arm round Tony.
   <p>It was Tony who spoke first.
   <p><squote>What did the man do, Daddy?</squote>
   <p><squote>Hush!</squote> Meg silenced him quickly, but he would have felt
better if she had said nothing. He wanted no protection from someone
weaker than himself.
   <p><squote>Nothing,</squote> he said and tucked the tie back inside his jacket.
   <p>Meg watched him, then held the car door for him and his anger
switched to her. He was not an invalid. But he checked himself, held
the anger back, and slid into the driving seat.
   <p><squote>Shall we go on?</squote> she asked and it was really a request, not a
question.
   <p>He nodded. Twenty miles across Rannet Moor, through Bisset and
Scowlea, then home. He could wait an hour for a cup of tea.
   <p><squote>I want some orange,</squote> Tony begged, and Meg soothed him.
   <p><squote>Hush, darling. When we get home. There isn't any here.</squote>
   <p><squote>But daddy didn't ask,</squote> the boy insisted.
   <p><squote>He did,</squote> Meg replied easily as Charles switched on the
engine.
   <p>He drove the first five miles along the black ribbon of the moor
road carefully, in silence. He was ashamed and he felt that all his
family, even Tony, were ashamed of him. Slowly his body calmed and
his brain cooled, but he wanted home; the touch and sight and smell of
familiar things.
   <p>He tried to tell himself that the car was an extension of home
and that while he was in it nothing more could go wrong. But the
moors were a cold, uneasy waste where every bush and shadow and dark
rise hid watching eyes and alien fingers.
   <p>Suddenly Meg nudged him gently and he glanced in the rear view
mirror.

<head>CHAPTER 29</head>
   <p>THE BLACK CANDLE Saturday night cellar party was on. The time
was approaching midnight. Margot and Jasmine had left together
shortly after ten. Before doing so at Mr. Copthorne's invitation
they had spent a pleasant half hour with Con O'Shea, Mr. Butler and
Mr. Narain Khuma at a table for four. At another table nearby Mr.
Smith and two of his officers in plain clothes were quietly chatting
together.
   <p>Ordinary members had quitted the club premises which appeared to
be closed and only Percy, weary and fed up was compelled to stay in
his ill-lit little cubby hole still on duty after hours until Mr.
Herman gave him permission to depart.
   <p>Saturnalia was about to proceed within that profane cellar. A
black cock and a white hen had passed through the flames and to quench
the unpleasant stink of burnt carcases and feathers, Mr. Copthorne
in his purple and scarlet Bardic robes and peculiar turbanned
headdress, had been swinging about an incense censer. The air was
heavy and thick with the combined smells.
   <p>Mr. Herman, who had been absent for a short while, entered very
hurriedly by the back stairway leading from the kitchen premises. His
face was as white as the damask deeply lace-edged cloth spread over
the refectory table on which stood the golden chalice from which all
had drunk and drained. He whispered hurriedly to his chief.
   <p><quote>We're cornered. Not a hope unless we can get them all away by
the side entrance.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Copthorne turned grey.
   <p>Without any waiting, panic-stricken and regardless of the rest,
he made a scuttling exit through the cloak-room door leading out on to
the side entrance.
   <p>Mr. Herman took over with one word.
   <p><quote>Scram!</quote>
   <p>Fright and alarm spread amongst the party guests and in the
sudden confusion to press through the narrow doorway a paraffin
radiator just under the purple and scarlet muslin draped platform was
upset followed by an explosion and a burst of flame, instantly
igniting the draperies and matching curtains at the sides. Seizing a
piece of carpeting Mr. Herman attempted to smother and quench them.
There was a fire extinguisher, but that was kept in the club itself
for handy use. The flames spread and mounted. He staggered up the
back stairway into his office and dialled 999.
   <p>As he came out of it, Mr. Smith and his two companions came
round the side of the rostrum where they had been concealing
themselves, and stood in the way.
   <p>Mr. Herman faced them. He had been trembling and shaking. He
ceased to tremble. He stood rigid and straight. He was on the stage
once again and it was the first night of a new play in which he had
been cast for the minor role of an evil man's dupe and confederate.
Could he have cast himself in the part of Mr. Copthorne, the
villain and apostate, he would not have attempted to run away from his
captors. He would have made his appearance. The Show must go on.
   <p>His first night nerves on this that was also his last night
dropped away from him. He had lines to speak.
   <p>Mr. Smith gave him his cue.
   <p><quote>Now then, Herman!</quote>
   <p>Mr. Herman's faintly mask-like smile was almost pathetic.
   <p><quote>Gentlemen, of course, I am at your service, but listen to me,
please.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't take too long then,</quote> said Mr. Smith.
   <p><quote>I will be brief. Can you not smell smoke? Turn your noses to
the kitchen.</quote> The men sniffed and coughed.
   <p><quote>Is that your trick?</quote> snapped Mr. Smith. <quote>Trying to smoke
us out, eh? Been burning something? You'll have to think of
something better than that. Show us the way below.</quote>
   <p><quote>Impossible. No doing of mine. A pure accident. One of these
paraffin lamps has been upset. The premises are on fire. I have just
phoned for the brigade. Arrest me. Whatever information you wish me
to give you later I am willing to provide. I am a knave and a low
fellow, a spreader of iniquity. I have no intention of scarpering
even if I had the chance. I have had enough to last me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Tail it off, Herman!</quote> Mr. Smith and his men were now
uncomfortably aware that Mr. Herman was speaking the truth and that
the club was on fire. <quote>Where's Copthorne?</quote>
   <p><quote>My leader in this fiendish racket, my dear sir, is not in the
house. He is well on his way by now to where I do not know, but even
if I did know for certain and told you, I doubt if you would be able
to catch up with his Rover 90 as he has had a good start. It might
conceivably be down to Sussex or to the nearest airport. You will be
much better advised to take me into custody forthwith and lock me up
once more in the all too familiar confines of a prison cell.</quote>
   <p><quote>You are under arrest.</quote> Mr. Smith coughed as a swirl of
acrid smoke drifted past him and his officers.
   <p>Mr. Herman held out his hands.
   <p><quote>Put on the bangles. The fire brigade has arrived. Hear it?
Regis Road pavements will soon be crowded with late-homers 
gathering to witness a fire in full bloom. Standing room only for
nothing to pay. I pray you let me continue to speak the tag. I
played Hamlet once and how I gloried in that role although the
performance only took place in a country public hall &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>That's enough, Herman.</quote>
   <p>The firemen were in, Percy, Con O'Shea and Mr. Butler were all
upon the scene.
   <p>Mr. Herman raised his voice above the hubbub and roar of smoke
and flames. Infinite pathos, regret and sadness was in it.
   <p><quote>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable seem all the uses of
this world! It is an unweeded garden that grows to seed. Things rank
and gross in nature possess it &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Pipe down!</quote> The two police officers hustled him forward
towards the entrance.
   <p>Con suddenly brushed past them.
   <p><quote>The cat, the white cat!</quote>
   <p>Percy tried to hold him back. So did Mr. Butler.
   <p><quote>The cat will have got itself out through the coal-shoot. Bound
to &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>It hasn't. I heard it mewing. I am sure and certain it was
the cat &mdash; let go of me, George!</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't be a fool, Con!</quote>
   <p><quote>Get outside, all of you, unless you want to be smothered, and
wait for me. I'll be joining you in a minute or two with the little
white cat in me arms!</quote> Con pushed himself free and dashed
forward.
<head>CHAPTER 30</head>
   <p>THE SPEED dash into Sussex was near to its end. The titled
displaced person chauffeur who was at the wheel, intent on the wheel
and covering distance, had not spoken a word. Nearing the village he
turned to look for Mr. Copthorne in the back of the car. He was not
on the seat. He was cowering on the floor.
   <p><quote>Stop!</quote>
   <p><quote>Do you not wish to be driven home?</quote>
   <p><quote>No. Put me down at the church.</quote>
   <p><quote>Very good.</quote> The chauffeur did not <squote>Sir</squote> his employer.
   <p>He halted the car by the Lych Gate.
   <p><quote>Thank you.</quote> Mr. Copthorne almost fell out of it, his
Bardic robes impeding him. <quote>I will see you in the morning.</quote>
   <p><quote>Perhaps.</quote>
   <p><quote>Perhaps. But &mdash; but you are not going to leave me, Count? You
know how I rely on your services.</quote>
   <p>The chauffeur did not deign to answer. He was self-possessed and
silent as always.
   <p>He opened the Lych Gate for Mr. Copthorne, closed it after him
and drove away.
   <p>Mr. Copthorne stumbled towards the church door and tried to
turn the heavy handle. It was locked. The verger would be there to
open it first thing in the morning. The rector liked to leave the
church open all day until the evening. He was very proud of the
venerable old edifice with its Norman tower. It would be made good
and sound, the restoration of its stone and wood that would ensure its
preservation for many many years to come, by means of the generous
purse of Mr. Copthorne, squire, and lord of the manor.
   <p>Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side of the church where
there was a small open outbuilding where the grave digger kept his
spades and forks and tidying up implements. It might be open. It
was. He entered, and seated himself in a huddle upon an upturned
wheelbarrow. His curious headgear fell off.
   <p>Strange things were going on in his bewildered brain. When a man
was drowning and towards his last gasp it was scientifically supposed
his whole life came up before him in some cinematic kind of sequence.
Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church outbuilding, but this was
happening to him now. He saw himself as a sulky, ugly, malformed,
repressed boy, then a young youth. He saw himself refusing baptism
according to the sect his parents belonged to. Walking out of the
chapel later on. Continuing on, his leaping mind flashed pictures of
chicanery and corruption, the growth of the deadly decadence and
absorption in debasement and Satanic debauchery. He saw himself as he
was and as he had become, a misbegotten, infamous, recidivist, past
praying for.
   <p>The church clock was striking seven. He had slipped on to the
stone floor. He gathered himself, swaying and uncertain and stumbled
round to the front door of the church again. The door was open. The
verger had just unlocked it and was about to depart when he saw Mr.
Copthorne entering in his very strange purple and scarlet robes
get-up. He didn't know what to make of it, but it was Mr. Copthorne
all right. Perhaps he had been attending some kind of fancy dress do
in London. Very strange his eyes looked. Mad, hunted eyes, as if the
poor fellow had rocks in his head, so the verger described afterwards.
   <p><quote>You're very early about, sir,</quote> he said, trying to speak
normally.
   <p><quote>Yes. I travelled down from London as the dawn was breaking,
and the thought came to me I'd like to take a look at the church.
I've never been inside. Very remiss of me,</quote> said Mr. Copthorne.
   <p>The verger led the way in.
   <p><quote>The stained glass windows, sir, they date back to the
fourteenth century.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Copthorne looked and saw the light stealing through upon
the illuminated figures of Saints and a central figure upon a Cross.
   <p><quote>Ah!</quote> he said. <quote>That figure &mdash; that Man wasn't afraid to die,
was he?</quote>
   <p>The verger was simple in his nature.
   <p><quote>No, sir. He died for all.</quote>
   <p><quote>And Christianity goes on!</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, sir, and always will.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Copthorne's breathing was deep and laboured. He seemed to
be sighing.
   <p><quote>I'd like to go up to the belfry. Don't come with me. I'd like
to go myself.</quote> The verger waited for him by the Lych Gate.
   <p>Mr. Copthorne ascended into the belfry. The verger could see
him standing there on the very edge. A bit risky. The next moment he
had either cast himself down or stumbled and fallen.
   <p>There he lay stretched out, his fat figure in a crude
spread-eagle, face forward.
   <p>The verger ran towards him. He tried to shift the unwieldy
figure and raise him.
   <p>Mr. Copthorne's head fell sideways. Very faintly, in a bare
murmur, the verger caught the last words he uttered:
   <p><quote>I am still baffled.</quote>
<head>CHAPTER 31</head>
   <p>ON SUNDAY afternoon a telephone message was conveyed to Margot
by Miss Maclaren, very quietly, on the fourth floor landing. Her
father was having his Sunday afternoon nap and the considerate little
woman did not wish to disturb him.
   <p><quote>A gentleman whose name is Mr. Butler, has just rung up to say
he has some urgent news for you and Jasmine, and he is coming round
now in his car with a friend to tell you. His voice sounded very
grave, dear, and he stressed that as it was on a subject that might
upset your father, it would be best to say nothing to him yet awhile.
Jasmine is getting herself ready now.

   <p>There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was quickly
through the customs. <quote>Gay!</quote>
   <p><quote>Gavin!</quote>
   <p>The girl and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
together. The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the taxi. <quote>Just a
moment, darling,</quote> Gavin pressed her hand and smiled. <quote>I want to
check up on the flights back.</quote>
   <p>Gay went out to the waiting taxi, and then found that in the
excitement of meeting Gavin she had left her sun-glasses on the
veranda. She went quickly back to fetch them. Gavin and the girl who
had got off the plane with him were talking. He was writing something
in his pocket-book, with a sick feeling of despair Gay knew that of
course it was her address.
   <p>Gavin joined her and at once dispelled her fears.
   <p><quote>That little bit you saw me talking to, her father is a big land
agent, she says that he sometimes has farms for lease ... you know
that's what I want, Gay, a farm and you!</quote>
   <p>
   <p><quote>Shall we go over to the little caf&eacute; opposite after
dinner?</quote> Gay, sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could hardly
believe that she was the same girl, miserable, shy, who had sat at the
little table for the first time a few days ago.
   <p>Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled and Gay's heart turned
over. <quote>I'd like to do that.</quote> Gavin drained his glass and refilled
it. <quote>And then we'll go for a stroll along the beach. A moon like
this mustn't be wasted.</quote> He gestured towards the bay where the full
moon was just rising over the rocks, then laid his hand on hers.
   <p>Gay smiled at him again, happy beyond belief, knowing that now
Gavin was in love with her and her only, yet remembering for a second
the kisses she had seen him giving Elaine. All that was part of the
past, she would put it behind her. She would never be jealous again,
would even take Larry's advice and look the other way if need be.
   <p><quote>I say!</quote> Gavin was looking over her shoulder. <quote>That's a
pretty girl!</quote>
   <p>Gay glanced behind her, <quote>Isn't she lovely, she's French, a very
well known model I believe. She only arrived today. That is her
father's yacht in the bay. The people she is with are the Belgians I
told you about who have been so nice to me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Does everyone go to the caf&eacute; opposite after dinner?</quote> Gavin
enquired casually.
   <p><quote>No, the older people usually stay here and have coffee and some
go to the night club up the road.</quote>
   <p>Bernice came over and was introduced. Gay felt happy and proud
as she made the introduction. <quote>We are going to the night club,</quote>
Bernice said, <quote>are you coming?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, we thought that we'd go opposite.</quote> Gay didn't want to do
anything other than be alone with Gavin and later under the light of
the glorious moon hear his explanation of everything and in shared
kisses put it all behind her.
   <p>They came out of dinner and Gay went upstairs to get her stole,
the night was warm, the sky cloudless, but it might be cooler later on
the beach.
   <p>She looked at herself in the mirror, wanting so much to look
lovely for Gavin. She lightly powdered her face, drew a pale lipstick
across her mouth, picked up her stole and ran down the stairs to where
she had left him.
   <p>The hall was empty, and she looked round thinking that perhaps
Gavin had gone outside when Larry came through, tall and elegant in
his white dinner jacket.
   <p><quote>Hullo, you're looking very lovely.</quote>
   <p><quote>Thank you, Larry, I'm feeling very happy.</quote>
   <p><quote>You are? Good girl. Everything all right now?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh yes, thanks a lot for your advice. Gavin is here! and
before I had time to write!</quote>
   <p><quote>Here? You mean the man you were dining with is Gavin?</quote> Larry
asked, looking surprised.
   <p><quote>Yes, isn't it wonderful? He flew over from Barcelona and is
going to stay two days. I can't think where he is, he said he would
wait here.</quote> She looked around.
   <p><quote>He's in the bar ...</quote> Larry looked at her a little strangely,
paused as if he were going to say something, then with a wave of his
hand walked off to join a smart looking woman.
   <p>Gay, a little puzzled, went through to the bar. Doc and Lilyan
were sitting just inside having coffee. <quote>Come and join us and bring
your boy friend,</quote> Doc called.
   <p><quote>No, Doc!</quote> Lilyan remonstrated. <quote>They want to be alone.</quote>
   <p><quote>I've booked a table at the caf&eacute;,</quote> Doc said, <quote>they are
packed tonight so come and join us if you can't find a table for
two.</quote>
   <p>Gay thanked him and walked out on to the terrace thinking that
perhaps Gavin had bought a drink and taken it outside.
   <p>She looked round scanning the tables, then caught her breath, a
cold hand seeming to clutch her heart.
   <p>Gavin was seated at a small table in a shadowy corner talking
animatedly to Simone. As Gay watched he offered the girl a cigarette
and lit it, his hands cupping hers in an intimate way.
   <p>Gay stood irresolute for a moment, half decided to go back and
join Lilyan and Doc, while she wanted to do no more than run upstairs
to her room, knowing that Gavin although he had told her that he loved
her, was already flirting with a girl that he had only met a few
minutes before. Larry's advice flashed through her mind, but she
turned away, giving a little gesture of hopelessness, knowing that her
pride would never allow her to look the other way and aware too, that
her love for Gavin had already lessened, although she was suffering
the pangs of jealousy.
   <p><quote>Gay!</quote> Gavin came up behind her and took her arm, <quote>where have
you been?</quote> Simone stood behind him, cool and poised.
   <p><quote>Come along,</quote> he took them both by the arm, <quote>now show me
where this caf&eacute; is.</quote>
   <p>Gay withdrew her arm on the pretext of adjusting her stole,
almost shuddering at Gavin's touch.
   <p>The caf&eacute; was crowded as Doc had predicted and Gay led them
over to his table, glad that she was not to be alone with Gavin. The
others were all dancing and as Gay drew out a chair and sat down
Gavin, without a word, swept Simone on to the floor.
   <p><quote>It doesn't mean anything,</quote> Gay told herself desperately,
trying to understand Gavin's point of view and remembering the advice
that Larry had given her, while she felt wretched beyond words. She
shivered a little despite the warmth of the night and turning round,
reached for her stole which was on the back of the chair. Without
meaning to spy she caught sight of Gavin and Simone. They were
dancing very closely and she saw Gavin lay his cheek against the
French girl's and whisper something in her ear. Simone looked up at
him smiling and nodded.
   <p>Feeling sick with unhappiness, Gay drank her coffee, aware now as
she had really known before that there was no hope of happiness in the
future for her and Gavin. If he could come all the way to Marjorca to
see her and then immediately start flirting with the first pretty girl
that he met, and in front of her, it showed only too plainly that his
affection for her had no depths at all. His behaviour was not only
boorish and in the worst of taste but it was unkind beyond words. She
fumbled with the cigarette packet which lay on the table not wanting
to smoke but needing some action to help her control her feelings.
   <p><quote>Come and dance,</quote> Doc's cheery voice came as a lifeline and
Gay got up quickly, managing a smile.
   <p>As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin and Simone go
through the doorway that led down to the beach. Gay closed her eyes
for a moment in disgust. She was fully aware that Gavin would make
love to the French girl on the sands, and no doubt he would come back
soon and after Simone had left expect her to accept his kisses on the
way back to the hotel.
   <p><quote>And that's the man whom you have been eating your heart out
over?</quote> Doc nodded towards the door. <quote>You may consider him a man,
I would say he was a mentally adolescent cad.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, Doc ...</quote> Gay protested weakly, <quote>you don't know Gavin.</quote>
   <p><quote>I've only met him today but I think I can safely say that I
know him a great deal better than you do.</quote> Doc gave her hand a
shake. <quote>Wake up Gay, and don't even contemplate throwing yourself
away on a chap like that. You're a fine girl, intelligent, and
pretty, and I had thought you were sensible too. Don't make a fool of
yourself over someone who doesn't care two jots for your feelings. If
he behaves like this now what is your married life going to be like?
Hell.</quote> Doc answered for her. <quote>Just Hell. Never able to trust
him out of your sight and having to put on a brave face and pretend
that you don't mind whenever he flirts with another woman. He will
you know, always, and you aren't the type who is tough enough to
change him.</quote>
   <p>Gay nodded. <quote>I know that you're right Doc, I think now that I
do realise that, and in any case,</quote> she added a little sadly, <quote>if I
did change Gavin, he wouldn't be the same, if you know what I mean.</quote>
   <p><quote>You sound like Alice in Wonderland,</quote> Doc gently mocked her,
<quote>and I'm glad you're beginning to see that you're wasting your time
on that chap. Now let him go and you won't have to wait long for the
right man for you to come along. If I was thirty years younger and
weren't married to the sweetest wife in the world I'd marry you
myself.</quote> Gay laughed, Doc was so kind and nice and she hoped that
one day she would be able to see the situation as it obviously
appeared to everyone else.
   <p>Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once again Gay found herself alone
at the table feeling self-conscious and awkward, sure that people were
talking about the way Gavin was behaving since they had seen them
dining together. She opened her bag to get out her compact and saw
Grace's letter. She drew it out and opened it, glad to be able to
occupy herself.
   <p><quote>So glad that you are having such a lovely time, dearie,</quote> it
ran. <quote>Your cards are lovely. I rang up Miss Harland and have been
over to sit with her father and do what I can for him so that she can
get out to do her shopping. He's getting on well but is pretty
helpless still with his broken arm. No other news except that Elaine
is engaged and going to marry a foreigner ...</quote>
   <p>Gay read the rest of the letter then put it back in her bag.
Elaine was engaged, to the man she had spent so much time with at her
party. That was why Gavin had come back to her. Everything was quite
clear now, and to her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak, rather a
sense of relief now that she knew why Gavin had come to see her.
Because she was second best.
   <p>The others came back to the table, all of them making a fuss of
her and at once she felt happier. Gay loved them for their warm
sympathy, knowing that they were real friends, even if they were new
ones.
   <p><quote>That is a pretty dress,</quote> Lilyan commented, obviously sensing
Gay's distress and in a way that Doc, as a man, could not understand,
knowing that Gay was as much ashamed for Gavin at the way he was
behaving as she was hurt for herself.
   <p><quote>I made it myself,</quote> Gay tried to speak normally.

<text id=LOBP03>
<head>CHAPTER ONE</head>
   <p>THE hospital was literally sited at the cross-roads, though set
back from the street by a drive of about a hundred and fifty yards and
cushioned by rounded shrubs and a belt of trees which helped to absorb
the noise of the traffic.
   <p>There was a large new roundabout and a sign which gave the
distances to both Edinburgh and London, Great Yarmouth and Liverpool,
for besides being at the cross-roads, St. John's was also sited
roughly at the heart of England, the highways resembling vast arteries
pouring the flood tide of commerce and private pleasure in four
entirely different directions.
   <p>Diana Wills often sat on the brand new seat outside the hospital
gates and thought vagrant thoughts. At one time she had watched the
workmen constructing the roundabout, which was to put St. John's
Casualty Department out of operation &mdash; in theory, at least. She would
think of herself as a stranger in these parts studying these
cross-roads.
   <p>Which one to take?
   <p><quote>If I were a tramp I would simply blow a feather,</quote> she
decided, rather envying the gentleman of the road his freedom of
decision, and wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded women
doctors to blow a feather and follow its airy directions accordingly.
   <p><quote>If I were needing a job I'd go to London, of course,</quote> she
went on. <quote>There are all sorts of wonderful jobs in London and I
could take my pick, whereas in Yarmouth one has to know something
about fishing and in Liverpool they'd want sea-farers. I don't think
I'd go to Edinburgh unless I was a Scot and wanting to get home, or
perhaps a student studying to be a doctor, and I already know all
about that.</quote>
   <p>Being at a cross-roads was unsettling, she also decided. One
felt as though one hadn't arrived anywhere. True, St. John's was on
the outskirts of Farlingham, a small, prosperous North Midlands town,
but apart from the inhabitants everybody else regarded Farlingham as a
spot where one could fill up the car, have a cup of tea and go on to
somewhere else with vastly more to offer in the way of opportunity and
entertainment.
   <p>It was getting too cool for sitting on the seat by early October,
Di decided, as she collected her various items of shopping &mdash; she never
carried a basket &mdash; and prepared to go inside for tea. She felt
chilled to the bone and somewhat depressed. Normally she looked
forward to her days off, an expedition into town, a visit either to
her hairdresser or the cinema and Nigel dashing out to join her for
either luncheon or tea in his screaming red M.G.
   <p>She was engaged to Nigel, had been for two years. Sometimes they
talked on the theme of <quote>when we get married</quote>, and then all was
wonderful, and perhaps it had only been a slip of the tongue when
Nigel had said, only last evening, <quote>If we get married, old girl,
you'll have to stop that lark, I can tell you!</quote>
   <p>She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or which
<squote>lark</squote> she would have to stop, only that significant tiny word
shouted into her very soul a horn of warning, and with it was coupled
a disembodied fragment of information, which now took on an ominous
significance: Nigel had been seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had
sworn he had been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
Little Phelpham.
   <p>Now Nigel had every right to go where he liked during his
off-duty periods when she was not free; this much they had conceded
one to the other. They rarely found they were off duty together, and
the situation would have been intolerable had there not been some give
and take about their relationship.
   <p>So when Nigel had told her about taking Luke's evening surgery
she had said, <quote>Bless you! I hope Luke is suitably grateful,
darling.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, well,</quote> he shrugged diffidently, <quote>I like the work. One
gets plenty of variety and it's a change.</quote>
   <p>Nigel was the hospital's Junior Medical Officer.
   <p><quote>You won't be free about nine, I suppose, to meet me for supper
somewhere?</quote> she had asked hopefully.
   <p><quote>Hardly likely, my sweet. Luke's surgery goes on for hours. If
they get in before eight-thirty, even though they're standing on one
another's toes, I've got to see 'em. If I am free, though, I'll
give you a ring, O.K.?</quote>
   <p>O.K.,</quote> she had replied readily.
   <p>So how could Nigel have been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse,
dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that very evening?
   <p><quote>No,</quote> she told Phil Gubbins, a junior houseman, <quote>it wasn't
Nigel you saw, my lad.</quote>
   <p><quote>It was Nigel's car, anyway. NUF 121.</quote>
   <p><quote>He probably loaned his car to somebody, Phil. He's always
doing that.</quote>
   <p>Young Gubbins shrugged.
   <p><quote>I didn't see his face, Di, but it certainly looked like Nigel
from the back. D.j. and all. Of course such as I couldn't afford
to go into the Load of Trouble.</quote>
   <p><quote>Neither can Nigel,</quote> smiled Diana. <quote>He's saving up to get
married. Remember?</quote>
   <p><quote>I remember,</quote> quipped the houseman, meaning no offence, <quote>but
does he? That blonde was something.</quote>
   <p><quote>Anybody I know?</quote> she smiled.
   <p><quote>I think so. I got a good look at her. But if Nigel wasn't
there it isn't important, is it?</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> Di said immediately. <quote>It isn't at all important.</quote>
   <p>But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had
realised it was important enough for her to have remembered, and it
was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and made her
think there was an abyss immediately ahead.
   <p><quote>Nigel,</quote> she had besought him, <quote>you know that evening you
took Luke Parson's  surgery and there was a woman with a cyst
on her ear ... ?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ye-es?</quote> he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the mouth,
an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge. <quote>What about it, my
sweet?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well,</quote> she laughed suddenly in an upsurging of relief, <quote>that
stupid Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble. With a
blonde, too. Imagine!</quote>
   <p>Nigel was frowning. He looked distinguished when he frowned;
boyishly handsome at other times.
   <p><quote>Gubbins? Gubbins?</quote> he fretted. <quote>Who's he?</quote>
   <p>Though Diana knew the name of every member of the staff,
distinguished or not, Nigel often had to think hard to sort them out.
   <p><quote>He's the carrotty  lad, isn't he?</quote> he now demanded.
   <p><quote>What was he doing at the Load of Trouble?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, he wasn't. His motor-bike had broken down outside and he
noticed your car and then you dancing with this blonde.</quote>
   <p><quote>Really?</quote> Nigel cocked one eyebrow. <quote>Actually she was
brunette at the roots and I had a redhead on the other arm. He would
have told you this, too?</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> she laughed. <quote>He didn't actually see you. Because
it was your car I suppose he presumed it was you, all dressed up in
your dinner suit.</quote>
   <p><quote>My white or my black?</quote> Nigel enquired. <quote>Now I wonder which
I wore at that particular surgery?</quote>
   <p><quote>You are a fool, darling,</quote> Di said happily. <quote>I shall
take great pleasure in telling that young man exactly what you were
doing that evening.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, don't,</quote> he said, after kissing her again. <quote>I rather
like to have the housemen think of me as a two-timing Don Juan. I'm
such a dull fellow, really.</quote>
   <p><quote>Dull?</quote> She couldn't believe it. Self-deprecation was not
one of Nigel's usual attributes. <quote>You need your holiday,
darling. I only wish I could go with you!</quote>
   <p><quote>Doctor Wills, if you're making improper suggestions ...?</quote>
   <p><quote>It would make me more interesting, I suppose?</quote> she enquired
archly.
   <p><quote>No, it wouldn't!</quote> he almost snapped, surprising her.
   <p><quote>You sounded like somebody else for a moment there. It doesn't
become you to behave like a &mdash; a tart, Di.</quote>
   <p><quote>Nigel &mdash; !</quote> she gasped. <quote>I didn't mean to behave like
anything of the kind. I was only joking.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, don't. It's miserable enough my having to take my leave
in the autumn without you trying to be bright and gay about it. I'm
going with a shooting party. What else can I do at this time of year?
I can't ask you up because it's a strictly stag affair.</quote>
   <p><quote>I know. I didn't expect ...</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, don't keep hinting, then. You wish you could come with
me; you hope I'll miss you; you can't imagine the hospital without me
for three weeks, etcetera, etcetera!</quote>
   <p>Diana's face was drained of colour. She was almost angry for a
moment.
   <p><quote>Am I expected not to mind your going away for three weeks?</quote>
she asked simply.
   <p>He looked at her, noting, as for the first time, the pansy blue
of the eyes that were his fianc&eacute;e's best feature. Her hair was of
a chestnut brown shade, which glinted with gold in the evenings, he
had noticed. Her figure was small and exquisite, like a schoolgirl's
still, and he admired her legs, which the male sex were inclined to
regard first.
   <p><quote>I would mind if you didn't</quote> he told her grimly, and
tugged her fiercely into his arms. <quote>You're right, pet. I do
need this leave. I'm bad-tempered and broody and going out with
brash blondes. I don't deserve you.</quote>
   <p><quote>Darling!</quote> her voiced caressed him. <quote>Moments like this make
all the waiting worth while. When we're married we won't have these
explosions of emotion, will we?</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he eyed her strangely. <quote>I wish we were married, Di.
Like a patient wishes his operation was over.</quote>
   <p>Again her laughter trilled.
   <p><quote>Marriage isn't as bad as an operation, Nigel!</quote>
   <p><quote>Isn't it?</quote> he rose and smoothed himself down. <quote>Ask any
bridegroom-to-be. Anyhow, that particular problem isn't looming
at the moment, thank God!</quote>
   <p>Problem ... ? looming ... ?
   <p><quote>Are we discussing a marriage or a burial?</quote> she asked, hardly
believing he could be serious. <quote>Surely marrying me isn't going to be
all that bad? If it is &mdash;</quote> she laughed uncertainly &mdash; <quote>you can have
your ring back.</quote>
   <p>She loosened the half-hoop of diamonds on her left hand third
finger and held it out to him, still playfully. Without a glimmer of
amusement in his own eyes, however, he took it, looking moodily beyond
her.
   <p><quote>Perhaps it's as well if you don't wear it for a bit, Di,</quote> he
told her.
   <p><quote>But I want it!</quote> she protested. <quote>It's my ring.</quote>
   <p><quote>You just gave it back to me.</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't! I was joking. You know I was joking, Nigel.</quote>
   <p><quote>You shouldn't joke about serious things like engagements.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't be such a baby!</quote>
   <p>They were going to have an open quarrel any minute, and she knew
it. Almost in desperation she appealed, <quote>Will you meet me at the
gate, four o'clock tomorrow?</quote>
   <p><quote>Why?</quote> he enquired, combing his thick, tawny hair.
   <p><quote>To bring me up for tea, of course. I just thought.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll see,</quote> he told her, and suddenly seized her in an embrace
which really hurt. <quote>Without your ring it's just like kissing
somebody else's girl,</quote> he decided wickedly, and kissed her again,
somewhat startled to receive a sharp slap for his pains.
   <p><quote>If I were somebody else's girl that's what you'd get,</quote> she
flashed at him, and so had left him, on her dignity and not seeing the
look of admiration and revelation which had followed her slim young
figure out of his sight.
   <p><quote>Mine,</quote> Nigel Lester had decided with a sigh of satisfaction,
and then regarded the ring which he retrieved from his pocket. <quote>At a
price,</quote> he concluded, with some bitterness.
   <p>
   <p>Thus had they parted the previous evening and now Diana was
trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital alone. Of course one
couldn't say for certain when a doctor would be free during the day;
tea was served from four until five-thirty in the residents'
common-room, which proved the elasticity of medical commitments.
Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention, she was
convinced, or he would have granted her small request to be met at the
gates. They often had such a rendezvous, for there was just time to
smoke a cigarette, if one walked slowly, between road and hospital.

<text id=LOBP04>
   <p>Carol waited until after the child had gone, then she sprang
out of bed and started quickly to dress. She would waken Jacques and
get him to drive her into Nice to Jimmy's hotel and together they
would go to the police with the diamond and emerald clip.
   <p>She didn't want to bring Ray into this. He had sentimental
loyalties towards Grant. He might still give him the chance to
escape, and if Grant did escape all hope of proving Ray's innocence
would be gone. But she knew she had to act &mdash; and to act quickly. She
had already aroused Grant's suspicions by her questions.
   <p>She went quietly down the staircase. There was only a short
distance through the foyer before she reached the front door. But
when she tried to close it after her a foot was forced in the open
doorway. Her shoulder was seized, and before she could scream a pad
was thrust into her mouth. She felt something shoved into her ribs,
and turning slightly sideways she saw it was the nozzle of a revolver.
   <p><quote>Keep going,</quote> Grant said in a low harsh voice. <quote>One false
movement and you're as good as dead. Don't kid yourself I'll be timid
about using this revolver; it's my life or yours.</quote>
   <p>She couldn't scream because of the gag in her mouth and he held
both her hands tightly behind her back. He made her walk round to the
garage and once there he bound both her arms and her legs tightly.
Then he bundled her into the back of his car, laying her on the
floor.
   <p>It had all happened so quickly she felt completely numb. And
anyhow she had had no chance; he had taken her completely unawares.
She hadn't even time to think where he might be taking her or what he
intended to do with her. He threw a rug over her and shortly
afterwards she heard him start up the car.
   <p>Jacques slept above the garage, but he was used to Grant taking
his car out at night. Ray and Sarah were also accustomed to it. Even
if they were still awake they would suspect nothing. It was no
consolation to know that Jimmy and she had been right, that Grant
obviously had not only been the notorious jewel thief but had also
murdered Greta. It seemed reasonable to suppose he had murdered her
because she had come upon him in the act of stealing her jewellery.
For once his timing had been wrong. He wouldn't have made the
attempt if he hadn't thought she would be out and he had undoubtedly
known that the few servants, who slept in another wing, were asleep
and would hear nothing. Probably he had had inside knowledge from one
of them. It had obviously been the same with the other robberies he
had pulled off.
   <p>But the knowledge that she and Jimmy had been right didn't help
her now. She didn't think that Grant would show her any more mercy
than he had shown Greta. She blinked up at the stars and occasionally
she saw lights and heard traffic as though they were passing through
villages or towns.
   <p>But presently they began to climb up a twisting road. They
climbed higher and higher. The thought flashed through her mind, this
is the Grande Corniche, the scenic highway road which links Nice and
Monte Carlo. Very few people drove the Grande Corniche at night; they
either drove round the Moyenne Corniche or the road that skirted the
Mediterranean.
   <p>Her heart sank. What hope would she have of rescue in this
desolate region? Jimmy had warned her that questioning Grant might be
dangerous. But what had finally prompted him to abduct her in this
way with the obvious purpose of killing her? Did he know that she had
Greta's clip? He might easily have been listening outside the door.
But if he had been, Sarah was equally in danger; it was she who had
found the clip in his car.
   <p>She felt icy cold and completely desperate. He would have no
hesitation about getting rid of the child as well as her in case she
babbled something about the clip. Or would he be afraid to kill
Sarah? He had done his best to put the blame for Greta's death on
Ray; but surely the police would never suspect that Ray had murdered
his own daughter? The thought gave her hope, though her own
predicament was still as desperate.
   <p>Grant was driving the car carefully. Obviously he didn't wish to
be stopped for speeding. But finally after a terrific climb he drew
the car to a standstill.
   <p>Carol had managed to twist the rug off her head. She saw that it
was a beautiful Mediterranean night with a full moon, a blue-black
sky, and the stars were shining brightly. What a night on which to
die, she thought, trying to feel amused. But it was impossible to
feel amused for the cord with which he had bound her cut into her
wrists and ankles; the gag hurt her mouth. How would he kill her? A
shot would be the most merciful end and she knew he had a revolver
with him.
   <p>He came round and opened the back door of the car. <quote>Had a nice
ride?</quote> he asked in a hoarse, cynical voice.
   <p>He removed the gag and untied her legs. The sudden sensation of
freedom from her cramped position was almost exhilarating.
   <p><quote>Few people pass here at night,</quote> he said, <quote>and I still have
my gun. So you won't dare scream. I heard you and Sarah talking so I
crept to your door and listened. I've been worried about that damned
clip ever since I lost it. You're not a fool. I know you've put two
and two together ever since the child told you about the clip. But
you suspected me before that, didn't you? I knew by those questions
you asked me the other night.</quote>
   <p>She raised herself to a sitting position. <quote>Yes, I suspected
you, but Jimmy Mattson also suspects you. He contacted the firm of
Brevet &amp; Ren&eacute; in Marseilles. You haven't been trying to buy the
lease of any luxury hotel. We also know there's no Hotel Imperial in
Marseilles where you could have stayed that night. If you kill me, as
far as Jimmy is concerned it will be a definite proof of your
guilt.</quote>
   <p>He asked almost wildly, <quote>But how can I let you live, knowing
that you know the truth? You might propose a bargain &mdash; your life for
your silence. But how could I ever trust you?</quote>
   <p><quote>What are you going to do about Sarah?</quote> she asked. And
despite her own danger that was the thought uppermost in her mind.
   <p><quote>An accident,</quote> he said. <quote>Probably while she is swimming with
the dog.</quote>
   <p>Carol shuddered, remembering the dream Sarah had had. All the
same her voice was very calm as she asked, <quote>What are you going to do
with me?</quote>
   <p><quote>You're going over the edge,</quote> he said. <quote>This is the highest
point on the Grande Corniche. It's doubtful if they'll find your body
for many days &mdash; even weeks. And in the meanwhile I'll be clear of the
country. Your friend Jimmy Mattson may have his suspicions, but he
won't have any proof. Ray won't have any proof either. Besides, Ray
doesn't suspect me of having had any connection with the recent jewel
robberies or with Greta's death. He doesn't know that I have been
bribing the household staffs of his friends for information about
their employers' habits and where they kept their jewellery, or that I
was responsible for those friends who called upon the Baroness
Beaufort the night her jewellery was stolen; their presence gave me
the chance to do what I wanted to do.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why did you kill the Countess Doriana?</quote> Carol asked.
   <p><quote>She came home early from the party and found me at the job. I
had to strangle her to silence her. I don't feel any sense of guilt.
She had always been a no-good woman. I'm sorry about you, Carol;
you're not a bad sort. It's a pity you took it upon yourself to
interfere with my affairs.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why wouldn't I?</quote> she threw back at him. <quote>You left Ray's
cigarette lighter beside his dead wife's body; you did your best to
implicate him.</quote>
   <p><quote>I happened to have the lighter in my pocket. I borrowed it
ages ago when my own lighter ran out of fuel. I had to protect
myself, and Ray was the obvious suspect. I'm going to give you a
drink and then I'll take that clip from your handbag. There'll be
something pretty potent in that drink; you won't feel any shock or
pain. You'll be unconscious by the time you go over.</quote>
   <p>He took a flask from his pocket and got a glass out of the glove
compartment of the car.
   <p>She set her lips firmly. <quote>I won't drink it.</quote>
   <p>He shrugged. <quote>Please yourself. But you're a fool if you don't.
The sensation of falling from a great height can't be over
pleasant.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'd rather risk it,</quote> she said. <quote>You'll have to shoot me
before I'll jump. And when my body is found the bullet will be traced
back to your gun.</quote>
   <p>He gave a low laugh. <quote>It happens to be Ray's gun. I took it
from his bedside table while he was sleeping. The police will
undoubtedly think that you stumbled upon some fresh evidence which
made it certain that Ray had murdered his ex-wife. The only thing he
could do was to get rid of you. I'll unbind your arms and then you
drink this down. That's the last thing you will remember.</quote>
   <p>He unbound her arms and then he tried to force the glass between
her lips.
   <p><quote>No,</quote> she shrieked and pushed the glass away from her.
   <p>He hit her hard across the face, but in her present state of
nervous tension she scarcely felt it.
   <p><quote>If you won't drink it, I don't care,</quote> he said presently.
<quote>You're going over the edge anyhow.</quote>
   <p>She screamed again as he dragged her from the back of the car.
Her legs collapsed under her. She fell sprawling at his feet. And
then suddenly it happened. A shot rang out. He lurched and gave a
cry and dropped beside her.
   <p>It could not have been more than a few minutes later that she
felt a man's arms about her; arms which were familiar and very dear to
her. She opened her eyes and in the white moonlight she saw Ray's
face bending over her.
   <p><quote>Darling, darling Carol,</quote> he cried. <quote>Are you all right?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ray,</quote> she whispered.
   <p>She must have passed out for the next thing she knew he was
shaking her.
   <p><quote>My darling! My darling! Say something to me.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm all right, Ray,</quote> she murmured. <quote>How did you find where
he had taken me?</quote>
   <p><quote>Sarah hadn't gone to sleep. She saw him grasp hold of you and
gag you and take you out of the house. She rushed in and told me. I
jumped out of bed and was dressed in a jiffy. While I dressed she
told me about finding her mother's clip in Grant's car. I wasn't so
long after you. During a hold-up in the Nice traffic I was able to
pick up his car. But when he started up the Grande Corniche I lost
him temporarily. I was too intent on catching up with him to be aware
that another car was following me. I had him in sight until he
disappeared down the side road. I turned off the engine of the car
and listened, and then the other car drew alongside me. It was a
police car. They had been detailed to watch the villa and follow me
if I tried to escape. Thank heavens they did follow me and that you
screamed. I had no gun and Grant was armed. I shouldn't have had a
chance if they hadn't seen what was happening and shot him down.

<text id=LOBP05>
<QUOTE>
But I should be back in an hour or so.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, at the hospital, I suppose!</quote> Lorraine did not wait for
her mother to confirm or deny this, but turned back to Noreen.
   <p>With a smile and a sigh &mdash; for it was obvious that the twins were
too taken up with their own affairs to enquire or sympathize &mdash; she
went out.
   <p><quote>Mr. Delorme was thrilled!</quote> Joanna went on breathlessly.
<quote>He's suggested we should go to town as soon as it can be arranged,
and, when we're settled, he's going to put us on at the Lys \d'Or,
which is a very exclusive night club.</quote>
   <p>Noreen looked doubtful. <quote>But is that what you wanted? I
thought you hoped to get on the stage or television? A night club
sounds rather a come-down. I don't want to sound discouraging, but
aren't some of them pretty low dives?</quote>
   <p>Lorraine, who had been lounging on the cushioned window-seat,
straightened up and leant forward eagerly.
   <p><quote>Don't be so nai"ve and stupid, Norrie! There are night clubs
and night clubs, as you'd know, if you weren't such an ignoramus!
This is one of the top places, frightfully swell. We'll get a
wonderful salary if we deliver the goods, and get to know a lot of
useful people.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oliver knows Mr. Delorme quite well,</quote> Joanna put in, not
noticing how Noreen's eyebrows went up at her unthinking use of his
first name. <quote>And if he backs anybody, that's surely good
enough!</quote>
   <p>There was such warmth of partisanship in her tone that Noreen was
astonished. She said impulsively: <quote>But you hardly know him, Jo!
Mr. Randall, I mean. How can you be so sure that he's on the
level?</quote>
   <p>Joanna stubbed out her cigarette with unnecessary fierceness.
Her lovely eyes were defiant above cheeks whose colour had deepened
at Noreen's remark.
   <p><quote>There are some people you don't have to know for years before
you can trust them. And Oliver Randall's one of them. He's
absolutely wonderful! He's promised to find us a flat &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Over Joanna's coppery head, Lorraine's eyes met Noreen's
enquiring gaze. She laughed mischievously, and without envy.
   <p><quote>As you may have gathered, Norrie, Jo's fallen for the man,
hook, line and sinker! And I'd say he'd be equally enthusiastic, if
it wasn't for his wife's restraining influence. I've warned Jo
already that she must walk warily when that lady's around.</quote>
   <p>Joanna sprang suddenly to her feet. <quote>Don't talk rubbish,
Lorraine! I do like Oliver, and he's been perfectly sweet to us
both &mdash; you must admit that! Not only to me, as you seem to imply.
There's no need to put ridiculous ideas into Norrie's head. By the
way!</quote> She turned to Noreen. <quote>I suppose you realize that we want
you to come with us when we go back to town? We explained to Mr.
Delorme that we must have you as our accompanist.</quote>
   <p><quote>Me?</quote> Noreen was taken aback. Somehow, she had quite
overlooked this possibility, and though, at one time, she had been
hurt by her sisters' apparent disregard of her, she was now aware that
the prospect of leaving Dorlcombe was oddly unwelcome. <quote>Mummy won't
like it if we all go off and leave her.</quote>
   <p>Joanna shrugged impatiently. <quote>If you prefer to stick here in
this dreary place &mdash; and you know just how dull and forsaken it is
after the season's over &mdash; that's your look-out. But I must say I
think it's rather mean of you, especially after we insisted to Mr.
Delorme that we must have you, as well. Let me talk to Mummy! I
don't suppose she'll raise any objection.</quote>
   <p>Noreen said no more. She felt that the twins would not
understand if she attempted to make them see her point of view. Their
trip to town, she thought, seemed to have changed them in some
inexplicable way. She knew that they had always been ambitious, eager
to try their wings in a wider sphere, but, now the chance had come,
they seemed to be thinking of nothing and no one save themselves. Yet
their mother, as Noreen knew, had done everything in her power to make
them happy. Surely she would feel very lost and lonely if all her
children deserted her?
   <p>When Mrs. Sangster returned, they could hear her talking to
someone as she came up the stairs. Joanna and Lorraine looked at each
other in bewilderment, but Noreen, recognizing Stephen's quiet,
pleasant voice, went out to meet them. She guessed, even before she
saw the eager look on his face, that he had come with the express
purpose of seeing Joanna, and her heart sank at the thought of his
probable reception.
   <p><quote>Mr. Redfern very kindly brought me home in his car,</quote> Mrs.
Sangster explained as they came into the room. Lorraine greeted him
pleasantly enough, but Joanna's greeting was barely polite. After a
few moments of general conversation, Mrs. Sangster said: <quote>Well,
I'm going to see about some supper. You'll stay and have some with
us, won't you, Mr. Redfern? Lorraine dear, do come down with me and
tell me all your news. I'm longing to hear how you got on in town.
And, Noreen, did you remember to feed the chickens?</quote>
   <p>The two girls followed their mother downstairs, Noreen carefully
shutting the door behind them, and deliberately ignoring Joanna's
murmur of protest.
   <p>After they had gone, there was an awkward little silence, then
Stephen said gently: <quote>I hope everything went as well as you
expected, Jo?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh yes! Better, really. We shall be going to London at the
end of this month.</quote> She jumped up and began straightening some
magazines on the table. <quote>We've been offered a very good engagement,
you see.</quote>
   <p>He rose and came over, standing just behind her. A tiny shiver
went down Joanna's spine, but he did not touch her.
   <p><quote>Well, that's grand! Just what you hoped for, isn't it? As a
matter of fact, I've got some news for you, too. Though I'm afraid it
won't seem very exciting to you &mdash; now.</quote>
   <p>She swung round to face him, arms folded, clear eyes wide. She
had changed from the suit she had worn for the journey, and was now
wearing her favourite attire &mdash; a thin, woollen jersey and slacks. His
hands clenched involuntarily as he looked at her &mdash; so lovely with that
glow of colour in her cheeks, her hair a bright halo about her
upthrown head.
   <p><quote>Why not, Steve? Always glad to hear of a friend's good
fortune!</quote> Her tone was deliberately casual and gay, and nothing in
her manner betrayed the way in which her heart was racing.
   <p><quote>Have you gone and got yourself engaged or something?</quote>
   <p>He faced her steadily, no answering gaiety in his eyes.
   <p><quote>You can't really think that, Jo. When you know there's only
one girl I'd ever want to be engaged to. No, I've come into some
money &mdash; not a vast fortune, by any means, but enough to make me feel,
at least, that I have something to offer you.</quote>
   <p><quote>But I &mdash;</quote> Joanna began. She stepped quickly aside, and would
have moved away from him, but he laid a restraining hand on her arm.
Gentle though it was, there was the suggestion of power behind that
touch, and involuntarily she stood still.
   <p><quote>I've never told you in so many words,</quote> he went on, his voice
as quiet and controlled as ever, <quote>but you must have guessed that I
care for you &mdash; very deeply. I've loved you ever since you were a
schoolgirl, Jo, but I didn't think I stood a chance compared with all
your other admirers. You wanted gaiety and fun; I was hard up and had
to put my studies first. My parents sacrificed a lot to pay for my
training, and it wouldn't have been right to let them down. But now
I'm really established, and with this unexpected legacy coming
along &mdash;</quote>
   <p>With an impatient movement, she pulled free from him and turned
quickly away towards the window, speaking with her back to him.
   <p><quote>Don't go on, Steve! Oh, don't think I don't like you, and I
suppose I should say thank you for &mdash; for wanting to marry me. But
it's quite impossible &mdash; it always will be impossible! Don't you
understand, the sort of life you're offering me &mdash; just living in
Quaystone and keeping house and all that &mdash; it's so deadly dull! I
want something different &mdash; all the things that I've now got the chance
of enjoying. Even if I loved you, I'm afraid I wouldn't say yes!</quote>
   <p>There was silence. Wondering, expecting a protest, she half
turned and looked at him. He was standing motionless, a queer
suggestion of defeat, of hopelessness, about the powerful shoulders,
the bent head where the fair hair was so smoothly brushed, save for
the unruly drake's-tail on the crown. Joanna's eyes suddenly
softened, and a reluctant feeling of compassion swept over her. But,
before she could speak, he had recovered his normal self-control.
   <p><quote>If you loved me, as you say, &mdash; well, it might not seem so
<squote>deadly dull.</squote> But you don't, and that's that!</quote> He smiled, and
held out his hand. <quote>Let's part good friends, Jo dear. If you're
going to get your heart's desire, that's all that really matters to
me. Will you apologize to your mother for me, and tell her I'm sorry
I can't stay to supper, after all?</quote>
   <p>As the outer door shut behind him, Noreen put her head round the
kitchen door and said doubtfully:
   <p><quote>Did I hear somebody?</quote>
   <p><quote>Steve's gone. He couldn't stay, after all,</quote> Joanna said.
She went quickly along the landing to her room and shut the door
behind her. There she sat down on the edge of the bed, dabbing at her
wet eyes, and telling herself not to be such a sentimental idiot.
   <p>Silly to be shedding tears because you had turned down a man who
didn't really matter a button to you. Oh, he's nice enough! Joanna
admitted. But there's nothing thrilling about poor old Steve.
Nothing to make one's nerves tingle and one's heart race &mdash; as it had
done only this morning. A dreamy smile spread over her face as her
mind went back to those heavenly moments. Leaving Lorraine to finish
their packing, she had gone out to buy some cigarettes, and, just
outside the hotel, had almost run into Oliver.
   <p><quote>I wanted to come and see you off,</quote> he had told her, with that
softening of his expression which always made her feel oddly
breathless. <quote>But my wife reminded me that I have an appointment at
just about the time your train leaves, so I decided to nip along in
the hope of seeing you before you left the hotel. It's going to seem
a long time until the end of this month, Jo my dear, but when you come
back ...</quote> his hand had closed over hers warmly <quote>... we'll make up
for all the empty days. Will they seem empty to you too, do you
think?</quote>
   <p>She had nodded, unable to find words that would tell him her
feelings.
   <p><quote>Well, it must be Au revoir, then.</quote> He had put his
hands on her shoulders and smiled down into her eyes. <quote>Wish this
wasn't such a damned public place, or I'd say good-bye to you
properly &mdash; you sweet thing!</quote> His voice fell to so soft a tone that
she barely caught the last three words. And with that, before she
could take a breath, he was gone, leaving her caught up to a pitch of
excitement and ecstasy that was yet perilously near to tears.
   <p>All the way home that parting speech had sung itself, over and
over, in her mind. <quote>You sweet thing.</quote> Did that mean &mdash; no, it
couldn't mean that Oliver was in love with her? But she reminded
herself, he doesn't say things like that to Lorraine! He must
like me better! And then, following hard on that delicious
knowledge would come the inevitable thought, But he's married! It
can't mean anything &mdash; except that he's taken a fancy to me.

<text id=LOBP06>
<QUOTE>
Why you took the case, when you never touch anything of the
sort.</squote>
   <p>For a second his grim, menacing anger frightened her as he half
shouted: <squote>Are you trying to suggest that I was her lover?
Responsible for &mdash;</squote> He stopped. Conflict tortured him. Here was
his supreme revenge: to tell her the truth; shatter her faith in
Philip... Beryl was dead... He shivered. Taking with her the only
proof he had to discount this accusation.
   <p>Sandra prayed, despite her vituperation, that he would have
some defence, give her some denial, but all he said was: <squote>If you
believe me capable of that, we have nothing more to say to each
other &mdash; nothing.</squote>
   <p>The hurt in him was like a wound &mdash; stinging, aching. Was this
Philip's work? And even if it were, it came back to one man's word
against another and... she loved Philip. Until then the exactitudes
of his profession had demanded his silence, and now he was absolved
from that promise, he found himself bound by his own love for her, his
desire for her happiness. Far better that she should believe him
to be a cad than the man she was going to marry and obviously loved
so deeply. He doubted that Philip would betray her after all that had
happened. Fear would be a deterrent.
   <p>Sandra flung her arms out in a gesture of despair. <squote>Do you
leave me anything else to believe? Or is your silence the
cowardly way out?</squote> She hated the words, but they leapt from the
torment of loving him; from the tension, the weariness that made even
breathing an effort.
   <p><squote>Is this what has been in your mind all the time?</squote> He spoke
with greater passion. <squote>Was this why you wanted to leave the job just
before Philip was taken ill?</squote> His mouth hardened, his eyes became
steely. <squote>I see.</squote> Scorn lashed his words. <squote>I wonder you dared
trust him to my care.</squote>
   <p><squote>Nicholas &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Well! At least I know the truth. Truth!</squote> His gaze held
hers masterfully. <squote>You wanted it so badly &mdash; at any price. I hope
you are satisfied.</squote> And as he spoke, the thought of Philip lying in
the other room filled him with a revulsion that was homicidal. Even
in that, his hands were tied. He dare not precipitate what might well
be another coronary. And in that second he put back his professional
mantle, and said with such icy politeness, such withdrawn bitterness,
that Sandra withered before it: <squote>I will leave you the necessary
prescription for the sedatives. You will contact your new doctor when
you reach your parents' house.</squote> She watched him flick his
fountain-pen from his waistcoat pocket, take out his prescription pad,
and scribble on it. Then, with a gesture she knew so well, he tore
off the leaflet and handed it to her. <squote>Good-bye, Sandra,</squote> he said
with a deadly finality. Watching him go, unable to speak, she felt
that part of her was leaving with him. She couldn't hate him... If
only he would have confided in her, given some explanation. Now there
was nothing &mdash; not even friendship.
   <p>She went back to Philip. But all she could hear were Nicholas's
words: <squote>I love you &mdash; oh, you know that well enough.</squote> Love.
She revolted against the word. Nicholas, Philip... where was
happiness, or peace of mind?
   <p>Philip put out a hand and grasped hers. He needed her. She
would find solace in that fact at least. And she hadn't to doubt his
sincerity any more... She had her truth. How much had built up
from that first ideal, and how little joy, or satisfaction, it had
given her. <squote>I'm sorry, darling.</squote> He looked nervous. It had been
hell lying there, knowing she was talking to Nicholas and wondering
what they were saying.
   <p>Sandra said instinctively: <squote>I told him I knew he was
responsible for Beryl's death.</squote> She rushed on: <squote>His attitude...
I don't know &mdash; something snapped. I couldn't stand it... Why do you
look at me like that?</squote>
   <p><squote>I asked you not to mention it.</squote> Philip felt that he was
running a high temperature as fear swirled back. What had Nicholas
said?
   <p><squote>I would never have done so while Beryl was alive. He hadn't
any answer &mdash; except to suggest that if I believed him capable of
that &mdash;</squote> Her eyes darkened in torment. <squote>Are you sure that
she was telling the truth?</squote>
   <p><squote>Good heavens, darling, why on earth should she lie? Besides,
it wasn't just her word. There was enough evidence, no matter how one
might want to disbelieve the facts.</squote> Elation touched him after the
cold wind of suspense. <squote>It will be interesting to see what comes out
at the inquest. What his story will be. I reckon he'll confine
himself to the nervous origin of her recent illness. His notes will
be truthful, but what he leaves out will matter most.</squote> Strange how
just then Philip was so certain that Nicholas would never betray
him. He loved Sandra too deeply to ruin her future happiness.
Had ever circumstances conspired so cunningly? Philip's spirits
soared. He was better; he had made a miraculous recovery and Sandra
would soon be his wife. The Devil, he thought, certainly looked after
his own. Something in Sandra's attitude struck him suddenly, making
him say: <squote>You can't forgive him for this &mdash; can you?</squote>
   <p><squote>Forgive is an unctuous, patronizing word,</squote> she replied. <squote>I
despise the deceit. The lies.</squote>
   <p>Philip couldn't keep the words back. <squote>Suppose you had loved him
and all this came out. What then?</squote>
   <p>Suppose you had loved him...
   <p>Sandra realized with a bitter futility that now it was her
silence that was the lie. And Nicholas's words re-echoed mockingly:
<squote>No human being could live with absolute truth.</squote>
   <p><squote>I couldn't live without faith, Philip. Or with pretence.</squote>
She shivered. She was going to pretend for the rest of her life.
Pretend to be in love with Philip even though she knew she would try
never to utter those words. How honourable was that? She looked at
him, and his need of her, his dependence upon her, created a climate
where self-delusion masqueraded as the right thing to do. How easy it
would have been to cling to Nicholas, tell him that she could hardly
bear life without him, no matter what he had done to make her despise
him... But to walk out on Philip, break her promise and end their
relationship, for no better reason than what appeared as innate
self-preservation. That was impossible. He had been honest with her
and didn't deserve to be let down. She said suddenly, irrelevantly:
<squote>Beryl's life recently &mdash; the whole thing &mdash; was very strange when you
think of it.</squote>
   <p><squote>How?</squote> Philip looked startled.
   <p><squote>Would she have married Nicholas in any case, since she loved
you?</squote>
   <p>Philip felt a stab of jealousy. <squote>Are you trying to make his
case good?</squote>
   <p><squote>No; to be fair. He seemed so amazed when I suggested marriage
to her. I've only thought of your illness lately &mdash; never studied all
this beyond the angle of Beryl's unhappiness and Nicholas being
involved. I didn't tell you, but she called here two days ago.</squote>
   <p><squote>What?</squote> Philip felt that he had been swirled down a bumpy
lift. <squote>But &mdash; why?</squote> He hastened. <squote>Why should she call?</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh, just to thank me and to inquire about you. Looking back,
her attitude was strange. She seemed afraid &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Of Nicholas,</squote> Philip said insinuatingly.
   <p>Sandra couldn't deny that, and the more she dwelt on it all, the
more curious it became. <squote>She spoke about wondering if she ought to
tell me &mdash;</squote> Sandra began to shiver.
   <p>Philip managed to keep his voice steady. <squote>I can imagine
Nicholas putting the fear of God into her. The last person he would
want told was you.</squote>
   <p>It added up, and Sandra nodded. <squote>But it is still like looking
at a picture in shadow.</squote>
   <p><squote>I told you that &mdash; soon after the cottage episode. What was she
keeping back... We certainly shall not discover now. One thing I am
convinced about. Her death links up with her miscarriage. She told
me once he was determined she should not go through with the
pregnancy.</squote>
   <p>Sandra gave a pained cry.
   <p><squote>Darling, I hinted that, too, you remember. I didn't want to
sound too dramatic, or &mdash; well &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>I know.</squote> She felt very sick as she sat there, desolate. It
was all so ugly.
   <p>Philip wanted to settle the problem &mdash; leave no loopholes.
   <p><squote>She lost either way, really. He wouldn't marry her, and he
dare not risk the threat of the child. Obviously it would have been a
handicap to her, too, and in her saner moments she must have been
thankful to get out of the mess... But she was neurotic. It's my
guess that the cottage episode was the beginning of the end for
her.</squote>
   <p>Sandra pressed the point. <squote>Meaning that Nicholas deliberately
got rid of the child?</squote>
   <p>Philip was far too deep in the lies to retreat from that direct
question.
   <p><squote>Yes. Her fear of him was pretty obvious. He had to take care
of her professionally, but he certainly didn't want you to know the
facts. She probably did. Beryl was a lonely person and had
very few friends.</squote>
   <p>Sandra nodded. <squote>Let's not talk of it again,</squote> she said dully.
<squote>I can't bear it... Everything's ready.</squote> She looked around her.
Part of her life was ending; a part she had loved. Leaving the flat
and staying at Monk's Toft would be an ordeal, despite the rest from
perpetual work.
   <p>Philip relaxed again. Now there was only the inquest, and he had
nothing whatsoever to fear from that. It was far too late for
Nicholas to make any accusations.
<head>EIGHTEEN</head>
   <p>THE inquest offered no surprise. Nicholas's evidence conformed
strictly to the law and ethics. Miss Graham had been in his care.
She had been in a highly nervous state. A verdict of suicide while
the balance of her mind was disturbed, was returned. Philip put down
the evening newspaper, looked at Gordon Neal, and said: <squote>Very sad.
Nicholas's testimony said everything and nothing. One never knows
the truth of these cases.</squote>
   <p>Sandra didn't speak. She felt that some part of her had
petrified, leaving only a shell. She lived mechanically, and while
physically rested, even as the days became a week and then two, she
found it impossible to overcome the desolation building up around her.
Philip was amazingly better and already busy on a new play. He
worked in bed, using a portable typewriter, and was completely
absorbed in his task. Sandra was there &mdash; to attend to all his
needs. His world was whole again and he, to himself, its hub. With
illness had come an intense instinct for self-preservation, a
concentration upon his desires. What was good for him; what was not.
Not overdoing it. The doctor recommended by Nicholas called each
week and then suggested that no further calls were necessary. Philip
felt like the child no longer centre stage.
   <p>It was Beatrice who said one evening after dinner, <squote>Hadn't we
better make some plans for the wedding? Quiet, of course.</squote>
   <p>Philip smiled smugly. <squote>They are made. I've a special licence
and notification has been given to the vicar. The best of having a
secretary,</squote> he added, talking of one he had acquired since leaving
London. <squote>Brandon's good. It only needs Sandra to name the day.</squote>
   <p>Gordon said curtly, <squote>It is usual for the bride's parents to
have some hand in all this, you know, Philip.</squote>
   <p>Philip bristled. <squote>It was never our intention to have one of
those carnival affairs,</squote> he retorted and in that second, he became
the man of success exerting authority.
   <p>Sandra watched her father's face pale. Philip, she knew, got on
his nerves, but everything had gone over her head. It didn't really
matter what was being said because she was no longer a part of it.
The thought of Nicholas haunted her, the sense of loss crucifying.
Her father's comment roused her as he said, <squote>I was not talking of a
carnival. But I presume we shall be allowed to have one or two of our
friends at the ceremony.</squote>

<text id=LOBP07>
   <p><quote>Yes, we were,</quote> she stammered out and hated herself for a
nervous stammer.
   <p><quote>Won't you two ladies both join me in a little drink then we can
all go into the dance room together.</quote>
   <p>Vera looked at Caroline. <quote>We shall be pleased to, Mr.
Carson,</quote> said Caroline.
   <p>David found them a small table pulled up three chairs waited
until the two were seated, then he said:
   <p><quote>I think this calls for a celebration. It is not often I have
the luck to be entertaining two such charming ladies. Excuse me a
moment.</quote>
   <p>As he strode off towards the bar, Vera said:
   <p><quote>Isn't he delightful?</quote>
   <p><quote>He seems nice. Perhaps he has taken a fancy to you, Vera.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not he. I told him on our first meeting that I was engaged to
a very nice young man.</quote>
   <p>At the bar David ordered a bottle of champagne and three glasses
to be sent over to his table. He thought that perhaps a glass or two
of champagne might get Miss Dodd into a friendly mood. He returned to
the table, sat down and offered them both a cigarette from his gold
case. They both took one, he flicked on his lighter and held it for
them then lit his own. A waiter came along with the glasses and the
champagne, he started to open the bottle.
   <p>Vera said:
   <p><quote>Champagne! This is certainly a celebration.</quote>
   <p>Later after they had finished the bottle of champagne and David
had taken care to see Caroline had had her glass filled three times
they adjourned to the dance room to dance. Vera immediately excused
herself to go off and dance with a man she knew.
   <p>David said:
   <p><quote>Shall we dance?</quote>
   <p><quote>I should love to.</quote>
   <p>The band had just started to play a waltz. David was a very good
dancer, rather to his surprise he found Caroline was also. Their
steps fitted excellently together. A waltz is one of the dances which
enables a man to get close to the woman. The moment he found she
danced as well as he did he drew her closer to him, she gave
willingly. When the dance came to a finish, he said:
   <p><quote>It is awfully hot in here. What about coming into the lounge
and having a cool drink?</quote>
   <p>Now while they had been dancing Caroline had not failed to notice
the eyes of quite a number of women were eyeing her with envy. She
thought it would be rather fun to walk off with this nice-looking man
into the lounge and leave them all annoyed.
   <p><quote>I think a nice cool drink would be nice. As you say it is very
hot in here.</quote>
   <p>Taking her by the arm David led her from the room into the
lounge. He beckoned over a waiter.
   <p><quote>What would you like to drink?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>A lemon squash with ice.</quote>
   <p>David ordered it, and a whisky and soda for himself. After they
had been served he said:
   <p><quote>I was taking a stroll the other morning and happened to pass by
your house. From the glance I obtained of the ground through the
gates you must have quite a wonderful garden.</quote>
   <p><quote>We have. I say we because it does not all belong to me, my
sister and I share the place between us.</quote>
   <p>Pretending he was unaware the sister was away he said:
   <p><quote>Doesn't your sister ever come here to dance?</quote>
   <p><quote>Often when she is at home. At the moment she is staying with
friends in Eastbourne.</quote>
   <p><quote>So you are all alone for the time?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not quite alone. I have the servants and lots of friends. Are
you staying long here?</quote>
   <p><quote>I wouldn't know. Depends on whether I get bored or not. When
I get bored I move on.</squote>
   <p><quote>Not bored yet I hope?</quote>
   <p><quote>I should never be bored in such charming company as yours.</quote>
   <p>In spite of herself Caroline felt herself flush.
   <p><quote>You must come and take a look round the grounds of the Manor
House one day, that is if you would care to do so.</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothing would give me greater pleasure. Can we make a definite
date?</quote>
   <p><quote>Come and have tea with me tomorrow afternoon at four o'clock.
After tea I will show you round the house and grounds.</quote>
   <p><quote>I shall be delighted to. Most kind of you to ask me.</quote>
   <p>Caroline was thinking, that will make some of the women in the
other room jealous when they hear I have landed this man to tea with
me.
   <p>David was thinking, I believe if I play my cards rightly I shall
land this woman in my arms in time. How wonderful it would be to
marry a quarter of a million pounds. He felt she had been on the
shelf for so long, if she really fell for him, once they were married,
he would have no difficulty in getting her to settle a nice sum on
him. Feeling it would not be wise to rush matters so soon he finished
his drink and suggested they returned to the dance room. Caroline
could do nothing but agree although she would have liked to stay and
continue talking with him.
   <p>Back in the dance room David found her a seat and went and asked
Vera to dance.
   <p><quote>Well, how do you like my friend Carrie?</quote> asked Vera as they
took the floor.
   <p><quote>I like her very much. She dances well and seems quite a
charming young woman.</quote>
   <p><quote>Carrie is a darling really. Just unfortunate for her she does
not possess the lovely looks of her sister. Every man in Gallows
Corner is mad on Susie.</quote>
   <p><quote>That I suppose leaves Miss Caroline rather out in the cold?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. They are both terribly wealthy. I have never been able
to understand why some man has not tried to snap up Carrie. She is
the sort who would make a good wife for a man.</quote>
   <p><quote>You don't think the sister would, is that it?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, that is not it. It is Susie, although she has heaps of
admirers she never seems to bother much about them. When at home she
is always too busy with her horses, riding to the hounds and taking
part in ladies' point-to-point races. Susie is a wonderful
horsewoman.</quote>
   <p>David had one more dance with Caroline later that evening then he
excused himself with the excuse he was feeling tired and thought he
would turn in. Saying he would be sure to be with her at four o'clock
the next afternoon, he said good night and left her.
   <p>David could see she was longing for him to stay and dance once
again with her. He knew he was doing the right thing in not doing so.
That would make her look forward all the more to the next day. He
went to bed feeling most satisfied with the evening.
<head>CHAPTER FOUR</head>
   <p>EVERYONE in Gallows Corner spoke of it as a whirlwind
engagement when it was announced two weeks later that Caroline Dodd
had become engaged to David Carson.
   <p>David had hurried his love-making up for the very good reason his
capital was fast disappearing and he was wise enough to know it would
never do to ask Caroline to lend him any money, after they were once
married he would see to it she made a settlement on him.
   <p>Caroline had never been made love to by such an experienced man
as David Carson, he literally swept her off her feet. She felt sure
she had at last found a man who would make her happy for life.
   <p>The moment the engagement was announced congratulations from most
of the women in Gallows Corner poured in to Caroline. The men had
varied opinions, the single ones began to feel annoyed they had not
tried to snap up such a wealthy woman in spite of her plain looks
before this Carson appeared, the married men told their wives Caroline
was a fool that they were sure Carson was merely wishing to marry her
for her money. Most of the wives argued the point, they, like their
single sisters, felt Caroline was lucky to have managed to get one of
the best-looking men they had ever seen.
   <p>David, who sensed the various opinions and felt some pressure
might eventually be brought to bear on Caroline to think again,
pleaded for an early marriage. She was not adverse to the suggestion,
but he had to use a deal of pressure before she would agree to a quick
marriage at a registry in Starminster. She wished for a marriage in a
church with bridesmaids. It was only when David said he was a Roman
Catholic, and unless he agreed to embrace her religion, it would not
be possible for him to marry her in the Church of England, that she at
last agreed to a registry marriage. Perhaps what finally decided her
was a letter she received from her sister, Susie, telling her not to
think of getting married until they had found out more about this
David Carson, than she had been able to tell her in her letter. Susie
said she would be returning to Gallows Corner the following week and
would like to meet this man and decide what she thought of him.
Knowing what a lovely girl her sister was, Caroline felt by doing so
she could be running the risk that David, once he set his eyes on
Susie, might change his mind about her so she told David to go into
Starminster and arrange the wedding as quickly as possible.
   <p>That fitted in well with David's plans. In Starminster he
arranged for them to be married in three days' time. It was only on
the morning before they were to get married that he arrived at the
Manor House pretending to look a very harassed man.
   <p><quote>Darling,</quote> he burst out with, <quote>I fear we shall have to
postpone our marriage for a few days.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why, David, why?</quote> cried Caroline, feeling alarmed he had
changed his mind.
   <p><quote>Well, dearest one, it is like this, when I left my apartment in
London for a short holiday I only drew from my bank enough cash to
last me about three weeks. The trouble now is, I left my cheque book
in my rooms and only recalled that I had done so about half an hour
ago. I must go back to London to get some more money, we cannot start
off on a honeymoon on the small amount I have left, and I've got to
pay my hotel bill in the morning. That is why I said we must postpone
our wedding until I get back.</quote>
   <p>David Carson had no apartment in London, he had no cheque book.
He had carefully thought out the lie he had just told hoping the
reaction to it would be Caroline would refuse to have her wedding
postponed and offer to lend him money enough to last until they
returned from their honeymoon. If her reaction was not like that and
she just said, very well, go to London and get back as quickly as
possible, he would then just have to disappear from Gallows Corner for
ever leaving his hotel bill unpaid. Luckily her reaction was what he
had hoped it would be.
   <p><quote>David, I simply won't agree to any postponement of our wedding
tomorrow. You are a silly to look so worried about the matter. I can
lend you whatever money you require until we return then you can pay
me back.</quote>
   <p><quote>That is sweet of you to say that, sweetheart, but I hardly like
to borrow from you the large amount I shall require for our
honeymoon.</quote>
   <p>David was continuing to play it up well.
   <p><quote>Don't be absurd, darling, I can advance you any amount you ask
for,</quote> said Caroline. <quote>Don't you know I am a very wealthy woman?</quote>
   <p>David pretended astonishment at this announcement.
   <p><quote>Heavens! Carrie, I had no idea you were a wealthy woman.
Naturally I thought you must have some money to be able to pay your
share of the keep up of the Manor House.

I shall serve them with tomatoes and olives, which I hope you will

   <p><quote>I'm sure I shall. Your cooking's wonderful.</quote>
   <p>Julia lingered on in the room for another few minutes, then she
ventured cautiously downstairs again. Adrian was now sitting with the
Portuguese engineer and his silent wife, and another man, discussing
seafaring matters in English. Julia attached herself to Lieutenant
Robson, reminding him he had promised to play dominoes with her again.
Their game lasted till nearly ten o'clock when Se&ntilde;ora Gonzalez
commanded everybody inside for dinner. Adrian excused himself, said
<quote>goodnight</quote> with a meaningful glance which Julia chose to ignore,
and drove off in the jeep.
   <p>Julia felt depressed and a trifle sad as Luis conveyed her to Don
Felipe's house on Saturday morning. Just before she left the Tafira,
a message had been delivered from the shipping company, instructing
her to be at their offices on the quay at seven o'clock on Monday
morning ready to embark in the Juno for Southampton, sailing
punctually at ten. As she looked out at the white sunlit streets, and
the palms and the flowers, with glimpses of the blue sea and the
golden beaches between the buildings, Julia knew she did not want to
leave all this so soon. Yet in another forty-eight hours her holiday
would be over, and she would be on her way back to the grey English
winter and all the worries of finding a new job and a roof over her
head. She sighed, thinking how unkind fate could be at times.
   <p>The morning began just the same as the others. The old
flower-woman sat in her usual place, and as Julia mounted the steps to
the house, Alvaro opened the door and made his bow to her. Pepita was
wheeling a little wicker cart round the pool today, the white cat
sitting inside on a cushion. She rushed to meet her friend eagerly.
<quote>Yoo-li-ah! Yoo-li-ah!</quote>
   <p>When she had swept her curtsey, and held out the lace-trimmed
flounce of her frock for admiration, Pepita led Julia off to help her
push the cart. Soon they were chattering away gaily. <quote>El
helado,</quote> gurgled Pepita as the maid brought out two glass
dishes. <quote>Ice-cream,</quote> Julia insisted. They both thought it quite
funny when they discovered chocolate was the same in both languages.
Suddenly Julia realised she was going to miss this little Spanish
child, so full of affection and the simple joy of life. It was
impossible to feel dull when Pepita was there.
   <p>Julia said as much to Don Felipe when he came home.
   <p><quote>I haven't the heart to say goodbye,</quote> she remarked as they
watched the maid pick up the little girl ready to carry her off to the
nursery. <quote>I've enjoyed Pepita so much.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ah, yes. You propose to sail home in the Juno, do you
not?</quote>
   <p><quote>That's right, alas. And you won't want me here tomorrow, as
it's Sunday, of course.</quote>
   <p><quote>I must tell Pepita then,</quote> he said firmly. <quote>You cannot be
allowed to part without exchanging your farewells. It would not be
courteous.</quote>
   <p>He spoke rapidly in Spanish and the result was extraordinary.
Hastily the maid set the child down again and retreated into the
background. Pepita stood there staring at Julia with all the
happiness draining out of her pretty little face. Her black eyes
filled with anguish, the tears brimming over and coursing down her
cheeks. Without speaking a word, she flung herself upon Julia,
seizing the girl round the knees. When Julia bent to try and comfort
her, Pepita uttered a heartrending wail and then broke into a torrent
of excited Spanish punctuated by screams and sobs.
   <p><quote>Pepita does not wish you to leave her,</quote> Don Felipe said
quietly. <quote>She is desolate, as indeed I am myself.</quote>
   <p><quote>This is awful,</quote> Julia exclaimed in consternation. <quote>Do
please tell her to stop crying, Don Felipe. I can't bear it. If you
could explain it isn't that I really want to go home. I just have
to.</quote>
   <p>Her father spoke to the child, but she went on weeping.
   <p><quote>Yoo-li-ah! Yoo-li-ah!</quote> she moaned beseechingly, still
clinging to the girl's knees and refusing to be lifted up.
   <p><quote>Oh, dear!</quote> Julia exclaimed. <quote>Whatever can I do?</quote>
   <p><quote>You could remain in Las Palmas,</quote> Don Felipe pointed out.
<quote>That would make my Pepita so happy again. It is rarely she finds a
companion who is as congenial to her as you obviously are.</quote>
   <p><quote>But how can I stay?</quote> Julia began. <quote>I only wish I
could.</quote>
   <p><quote>I should be only too delighted to engage you as governess for
Pepita,</quote> he answered. <quote>You would soon acquire sufficient Spanish
to be able to help her with her first lessons. You could read to her,
and sing with her and so on. Enlarge her knowledge of English still
more. It would not be arduous, and naturally I would pay you an ample
salary. So will you not agree to spend the winter in Las Palmas, Miss
Barclay, and dry Pepita's tears?</quote>
   <p>Julia hesitated. It was certainly an exciting offer, far more
attractive than going back to London. She might continue to live at
the Hotel Tafira for the next few months, enjoying the climate and the
friendly beach and caf&eacute; life. And there was Don Felipe himself,
the handsome man watching her now with an unaccustomed trace of
anxiety in his eyes. Feminine intuition told Julia he wanted her to
stay on for his own sake as well as Pepita's. It was flattering to
know a man like this one considered you important to him.
   <p>She realised she was weakening, but then all at once she
remembered what she had heard the previous evening. Yet it was
probably no more than gossip that Mrs Henderson had repeated, and
what Se&ntilde;ora Gonzalez had told her cast no reflection on Don Felipe
either. He could not be blamed for his father's state of mind.
Adrian had said she might be running into danger with him, but Adrian
could be wrong, and anyway it was no business of his what Julia
Barclay did. He had no right to dictate to her, behaving in that
high-handed fashion. She felt herself stiffening again as she
remembered his voice and manner. She would show Adrian he was
completely wrong, and stupidly old-fashioned at that. She found Don
Felipe fascinating from every aspect. She lifted her eyes to smile at
him now.
   <p><quote>You make it sound too tempting,</quote> she surrendered. <quote>Very
well, then, if you do really think I'm capable of being Pepita's
teacher. I've never done anything of that sort before, you know.</quote>
   <p><quote>I am quite satisfied,</quote> he replied. <quote>So you will stay, Miss
Barclay?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I will. And thank you ... Do please tell Pepita. I
can't bear to see her like this.</quote>
   <p>She watched the child's expression change as her father spoke to
her. She ceased to sob and the light stole back into her face again.
For a few moments she gazed up at Julia doubtfully, incredulously.
Then gradually the dark eyes grew bright once more, and even began to
sparkle as was their wont. Julia lifted her up, and she immediately
wound her small arms round the girl's neck, nuzzling her cheek,
snuggling against her hair. Don Felipe smiled as he watched them.
   <p><quote>Pepita is restored,</quote> he said. <quote>We are both most grateful to
you.</quote>
   <p>There was a rustling sound behind them, and Julia half-turned to
see Do&ntilde;a Beatriz standing on the tiles. It was the first time
Julia had ever met the older woman outside the dining-room. One
moment Do&ntilde;a Beatriz was in her vision, a tall black figure staring
at the little scene. The next she was gone again. Julia was almost
convinced her eyes must have deceived her. Pepita was finally carried
off to the nursery, and as Don Felipe led the way indoors to luncheon,
Do&ntilde;a Beatriz was already there, sitting in her accustomed chair at
the foot of the long table. She bowed gravely to Julia, acknowledging
the girl's greeting, and began to serve in her usual silence. Julia
had already realised there was something quite off-beat about Do&ntilde;a
Beatriz, so she was careful to address only Don Felipe at her side
throughout the meal.
   <p>They discussed the fiesta, which he waved aside as a trifling
celebration in Las Palmas.
   <p><quote>In the country it is much more important,</quote> he said.
<quote>Harvest is something for which we offer gratitude indeed there. I
shall be out at my own estate in the morning, marking the day with my
workpeople. My land is around the village of San Bernardo, a
beautiful valley with many foothills. I have a large house there
beside the river. You must see it one day.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I should like to.</quote>
   <p><quote>You have not penetrated the interior of the island yet? No?
It will surprise you. The mountains are so majestic they take the
breath away when they are viewed for the first time.</quote>
   <p><quote>You've another house at Tojeda, haven't you?</quote> Julia
remembered. <quote>On the cliffs &mdash; somebody was telling me &mdash;</quote> Then she
stopped abruptly, realising what she was saying.
   <p>Don Felipe had begun to peel himself a peach. He completed the
delicate operation before he answered. Then he laid down his silver
knife and looked at Julia directly as he spoke.
   <p><quote>So. People have talked about me. I wonder what else they said
about Tojeda. No, do not trouble to tell me, Miss Barclay. I can
guess. I know what scandal is tossed about in the caf&eacute;s and
hotels.</quote>
   <p>Julia felt a trifle uncomfortable.
   <p><quote>I didn't really pay great attention,</quote> she began, but
imperiously he cut her short.
   <p><quote>We will discuss this matter later,</quote> he said, <quote>when we may be
private. Now tell me, have you been to the aquariums yet? ...</quote>
   <p>As soon as the meal ended, Do&ntilde;a Beatriz slipped away as usual
and Don Felipe indicated that Julia was to follow him.
   <p><quote>We will go to my study,</quote> he decided. <quote>I have to speak to
you about Pepita's education among other things.</quote>
   <p>He led Julia to a wing of the house she had not seen before.
Like all the rest, this room was richly furnished, with handsome red
brocade curtains, and a carved mahogany desk and chairs. Don Felipe
unlocked a drawer and handed Julia an envelope.
   <p><quote>Your salary to date,</quote> he explained. <quote>On Monday we begin our
new arrangement, of course. I had thought ...</quote> He named a figure
which Julia knew was generous in the extreme. <quote>So you will be here
at the same time then. The car will call for you as usual.</quote>
   <p><quote>Thank you very much, Don Felipe. I'll do my best.</quote>
   <p>She waited, thinking he was going to talk to her about his
daughter, and what he wanted a governess to do, but Don Felipe made no
mention of Pepita now. Instead he frowned to himself for a moment, as
though lost in thought. Then he lifted his head and asked quietly:
   <p><quote>I wonder what tales you have heard about me, Miss Barclay.
Could you not repeat them to me?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I don't quite know &mdash;</quote> Julia hesitated.
   <p>Don Felipe twisted his lips into a wry smile.
   <p><quote>It was obviously unflattering to me,</quote> he remarked.
   <p><quote>But there is no need to be embarrassed, Miss Barclay. I know
what is said on the island. Loose tongues wag here just as they do
everywhere else. Gran Canaria is certainly a paradise, but it has its
serpents too.</quote>
   <p>He paused to consider her. Julia returned his glance
sympathetically, appreciating that it was not easy for this man to
bare his innermost feelings. Don Felipe continued:
   <p><quote>You have plainly heard uncharitable comments about me, so you
must permit me to tell you the facts myself. Seven years ago I
married the daughter of one of my fellow landowners, Don Miguel \de
Francia. We were deeply in love and very happy. After Pepita's
birth, the doctors informed my wife that she could bear no more
children. Naturally it was a tremendous grief. We had hoped for sons
to carry on our name.

<QUOTE>
The best thing we can do seems to be to concentrate on work,
doesn't it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Under Rufus Horgan!</quote> he said.
   <p>Andrea flinched. For a moment she had forgotten that, and now
the sting in his voice made her think he was trying to hurt her. Not
that she could have blamed him. Then she remembered how he had been
passed over, and realised how he must feel. And on top of that to
have almost won her, only to see for himself how the idea suddenly
revolted her. No, she couldn't blame him for wanting to hurt her!
   <p><quote>Under him, as you say,</quote> she agreed dully. <quote>It's life, I
suppose. And now &mdash; goodbye.</quote>
   <p><quote>Will you be here or at the house tomorrow?</quote>
   <p><quote>Here &mdash; to begin with. Goodbye.</quote>
   <p>On the second attempt, she got away. She could not bear to let
him know Mark had not made any definite arrangements about her going
to his home again.
   <p>Perhaps never, she thought, when at last she was in her own room,
staring at her white face in the mirror. Perhaps she had given
herself away too blatantly, and he would keep clear of her. He had
Pauline to interpret his wants, so perhaps any typist would do &mdash;
   <p>Next day, a sickening desert of hours in the office, it seemed
she was right. There was no phone call for her. Normally she could
have telephoned the house to ask how he was, but now she was too
ashamed. Then, late in the afternoon, when she had ceased hoping to
hear his voice every time her telephone rang, Gus answered a call.
She stiffened, listening.
   <p><quote>Oh, it's you, Mark?</quote> she heard him say. <quote>Still making-out?
Fine! Something you want us to do here?</quote>
   <p>Andrea trembled. She kept her pencil moving and her head bent,
but she was straining to hear every word.
   <p><quote>Oh, hell!</quote> was all Gus said at first. The receiver crackled
for a while, and then: <quote>Well, we'll go through with it. You know
you can trust Andrea and me. The guy needn't know we hate his guts
for coming here instead of you. You want me in on your first
conference? O.K. Thanks a lot &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Mark must have said goodbye then, for the American put down the
receiver. She felt him looking across at her, but would not look up
until he said:
   <p><quote>Horgan's coming tomorrow. I guess I'd better go and break it
to the boys in the lab.</quote>
   <p>He eased himself up and ambled off. By the time he came back,
she had taken a grip on her whirling emotions, managed to sound cool
when she spoke.
   <p><quote>Gus,</quote> she said, <quote>what about that leakage business? Does
Dr. Horgan have to know?</quote>
   <p><quote>He'll have to know I suppose. It'll all come out in the
handover. Now, if I could just trip over one of my own feet, or
something, and didn't have to meet him tomorrow over at Mark's
place &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't be absurd. You have to keep your job.</quote>
   <p><quote>And I have to bring him back and induct him here, and the
scientist in me sure hates it. Understand?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. And I'm sure Mark does, too. I'm sure everyone feels the
same.</quote>
   <p><quote>They're taking it badly in the lab. You know, I think Mark's
latest theory about the leakage &mdash; that it was just coincidence &mdash; was
right. I can't see any of those boys letting out a word of what
passes here, even if they know &mdash; which, thanks to the system, none of
us really does.</quote>
   <p><quote>I think it's all over, anyway. Any instructions for me
tomorrow, while you're away?</quote>
   <p><quote>Just see the place is all spruced up and no dust on the
files,</quote> he said with an attempt at an understanding grin. <quote>And
have one of the girls from the typing school warned she may be needed.
Mark will want you with him and Horgan quite a bit. I've to run the
show here until he has everything sewn up. Though how I shall do it,
I just don't know.</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll manage perfectly,</quote> she said automatically.
   <p>He said nothing more. Next morning she was in charge of the
office; Gus didn't come back for lunch, which she had a vision of
Pauline serving to the three scientists.
   <p>Andrea ate in the canteen hastily, but forcing herself to mix
with the other girls as though today was just like any other day &mdash; as
it was to them. The shock and sensation of Mark's blindness was over,
and unless his successor turned out to be young and attractive they
were barely interested.
   <p>The moment she glimpsed Dr. Horgan through the office window,
getting out of Gus' car, she knew he was no heart-throb. He wore
rimless glasses, was short, conventionally dressed and
dedicated-looking. Mark, without his height and personal magnetism,
she supposed bitterly.
   <p>Then the two men came into the office, and Gus was introducing
her. Dr. Horgan's eyes behind his spectacles were friendly and his
smile kind.
   <p><quote>Dr. Pentland told me about you, Miss Holme,</quote> he said,
shaking hands. <quote>I'm sure we shall work well as a team &mdash; and I'm to
have the benefit of sitting-in on your work with him for a time. The
idea is that we meet and work at his home in the mornings and I remain
behind for fuller discussion in the afternoon. Today I'm simply
looking round &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Gus led the way, showing him what had been Mark's desk and his
small inner office which he had used for highly secret work. Then
they went off to the lab and the other departments, and Andrea could
drop the forced smile from her lips and stare into space.
   <p>It sounded as though she might never again be alone with Mark.
   <p>Why should she want to be? she asked herself furiously. Why
offer herself again and again for punishment?
   <p>The door opened and Gus came back.
   <p><quote>Leaving him to get acquainted,</quote> he explained.
   <p><quote>Did you see Pauline?</quote>
   <p>He blinked, looking at her vaguely. <quote>Did I? Sure. She served
us a pretty good lunch.
   <p><quote>She's certainly settled down. Old Mark seems to rely on her
quite a bit.</quote>
   <p>Even if the words were not meant as a barb they drove deep into
Andrea's heart.
<head>CHAPTER 14</head>
<head>Talk Of Pity</head>
   <p>FOR Andrea the next few days were terrible. Not only for
herself, but in knowing Mark's agony in gradually transferring his
affairs, including his confidential secretary, to the older man.
Particularly the agony of those talks from which even she was
excluded, when he confided the highly secret details of his
discoveries.
   <p>The only way she could get through the days was by turning
herself into a sort of robot and trying not to think &mdash; not to feel
when she saw from Mark's expression that his head was aching with
strain. Not to care that behind the very dark glasses, that gave him
such a distinguished look, were eyes that could not see.
   <p>It was about ten days before Dr. Horgan worked in the factory
office, when he dictated a few letters after returning from Mark's
home. And then one afternoon Horgan came soon after lunch. Andrea
saw him drive up and get out briskly.
   <p><quote>Dr. Pentland has some jobs for you, Miss Holme,</quote> he said,
striding in. <quote>Call in a typist for me and go over to him, will you?
I may not get back there today &mdash; it depends on the work here.</quote>
   <p>Andrea telephoned the typing pool. As she did so, she met Gus'
eyes. This is the take-over, they said, as plainly as speech, and she
knew that it was true. This might be the very last time she would go
to the Pentlands' home to work for Mark...
   <p>It was a lovely afternoon, mockingly lovely. Once the
rectangular steel-and-glass blocks of the factory were behind her and
she was cycling along the short-cut, she might have been in the heart
of unspoilt country.
   <p>There was a drone of bees in the roses over the porch of the
house, and a great bowl of half-opened roses on the old chest in the
hall. Pauline, Andrea thought, as she turned into Mark's office &mdash; and
then the flicker of jealousy roared up into a great burning flame.
For Pauline was in the office with Mark &mdash; very close to him. Andrea
had a horrible impression that they sprang apart as she entered.
   <p><quote>Oh &mdash;</quote> the blonde exclaimed, turning. <quote>I didn't hear you.</quote>
   <p>For a moment Andrea thought she was going to burst into tears so
overwhelming was the certainty that all her vague feelings about
Pauline and Mark had been only too well founded.
   <p>And then her throbbing pulses steadied, for she saw there were
books scattered over the carpet between them, and an overturned bowl
of roses. Pink, cream and scarlet, they were lying everywhere.
   <p><quote>Dr. Horgan said you wanted me &mdash;</quote> she got out.
   <p><quote>I do.</quote> Mark turned his head in her direction, while his
hands groped for the back of a nearby chair. <quote>But I've just been
extremely clumsy, trying to find my way around. Knocked something
over and turned the whole room into a shambles, apparently!</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, no &mdash; it's not so bad as that.</quote> Pauline stooped and began
dabbing at the water on the carpet with a scarf she had pulled from
her neck. <quote>It's just a good thing I hadn't left to do your mother's
shopping before you shouted for me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't worry. Andrea could have cleared up.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why yes, of course. But I didn't know she was coming. It's
all my fault, Mark, not warning you where the flowers were.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, leave it, now, or you'll miss your bus.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. I'd better get another pair of gloves &mdash;</quote>
   <p>The girl was wearing her outdoor coat &mdash; fabric gloves, and big
china earrings that, as usual, warred with the rest of her outfit.
She was strangely breathless. As for Mark, unless it was a trick of
the light, he looked very white.
   <p>Was it true that Pauline had dashed in in response to a shout
from him when everything cascaded down off the top of the bookcase?
Or had there been a love scene, when some clumsy movement of Mark's
might have caused the accident? There was certainly a strange tension
in the air.
   <p><quote>You don't mind fetching a cloth from the kitchen?</quote> Pauline
asked. <quote>I simply must run!</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll see to it. Don't worry.</quote>
   <p>Andrea wheeled and went off, leaving them to say what they liked
to each other. But Pauline came out at once. Andrea heard her go
racing upstairs, then the rapid opening and shutting of a drawer and
her footsteps coming down again.
   <p><quote>So sorry to trouble you!</quote> she called, turning her fair head
to flash the other girl a smile as they passed in the hall.
   <p>As Pauline ran out and down the drive, Andrea braced herself and
walked back into the office. Mark was still standing where she had
left him &mdash; she had to go down almost at his feet, to mop up the water.
   <p><quote>I'll rearrange the flowers and I'd better get a towel to dry
the books,</quote> she said, trying to sound casual and failing. There
was something in the atmosphere! It could only mean she had
blundered in on a love scene, however unpremeditated and brief it
might have been.
   <p><quote>Do, please,</quote> Mark said curtly.
   <p>It seemed to take hours of coming and going, and all the time he
stood there, until he must have known by her silence that it was all
cleared up.
   <p><quote>Have you finished?</quote> he asked. <quote>Sorry to be such a clumsy
oaf. Better get down to work now, hadn't we? It's really only a few
personal letters.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm ready. Aren't you going to sit down?</quote>
   <p><quote>Thanks, I'd rather stand &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He paced up and down, feeling his way by the chairs that were
always strategically placed for him. His mind was obviously
distracted &mdash; these letters to people who had written sympathetically
about his tragedy seemed to give him more trouble than the most
intricate scientific calculations.

<text id=LOBP10>
   <p>Gaby touched his wrist. <quote>Now that we are in my country, will
you allow me to choose for you a really French meal?</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course.</quote>
   <p>As she gave the order to the waiter, using her hands so
expressively it was difficult for Rob to imagine why she had singled
him out. She could surely have had any man she wished. She was
looking very young tonight, and, as usual, indescribably beautiful, in
a simple strapless dress of a green and white silky cotton. Her
shoulders and face were still tanned, and in this light the shade of
her hair had deepened to a burnt honey.
   <p>She met his gaze. <quote>You are looking at me again, Rob.</quote>
   <p><quote>I was just thinking how lovely you are. You make me say all
the things I never thought I could say aloud.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not even to Diana?</quote> There was a glint in her eye.
   <p><quote>We won't mention Diana tonight,</quote> he said abruptly. <quote>I don't
want to make comparisons.</quote> He sounded pompous, but he did not want
to be made to feel guilty this evening, of all times.
   <p><quote>No, of course not.</quote> She was silent while the first course of
steaming artichokes, soaked in a buttery sauce, was served.
   <p>Then her smile dazzled him. <quote>I hope you have a good appetite
tonight, Rob. I have ordered a lot of things.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll eat them somehow, then we'll walk it off afterwards.</quote>
   <p>There was blue trout next, then a young chicken that had been
cooked in wine and herbs, finally a platter of cheese and fruit.
   <p>Rob took a deep breath. <quote>I think that was the best meal I've
ever eaten. I think of beans on toast in Birmingham and shudder. Or
spaghetti. I won't like going to Italy!</quote>
   <p><quote>Will you ever go back, Rob?</quote> she asked, skinning a peach with
absorbed skill.
   <p><quote>Not if I can help it. That phase of my life is over.</quote>
   <p><quote>And the future, Rob, what do you look for in the future?</quote>
   <p><quote>Whatever comes,</quote> he said lightly. <quote>This is a see-saw
business. I'll stay at the top just as long as I can, then try to
accept defeat as gracefully as I can.</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll stay at the top for years, Rob. We both will. I know
that,</quote> she said vehemently. <quote>Before we are finished, everyone in
Paris, Rome and New York will have heard all about Rob Martin, the
famous British singer.</quote> She leaned across the table so that the
perfume of her hair drifted up to him. <quote>With the two of us in
partnership, we can go a long way. You do believe that?</quote>
   <p>The expression in her eyes was hidden from the lamplight. He
looked at her for a long time. Then he said slowly, <quote>Yes, I believe
that. I believe that, with you, I could do just about anything anyone
asked me.</quote>
   <p>She sat back smiling triumphantly. <quote>We shall sing our way round
the world, Rob. Perhaps we shall be invited to those cities we have
only read about. People will talk of us as they did of Nelson Eddy
and Jeannette Macdonald. That was a long time ago, I know, but no
singing partnership achieved quite the fame they did. But we will,
Rob, we will,</quote> she ended fiercely, and she gripped his hand as
though she would never let it go.
   <p>Abruptly he said, <quote>I'll pay the bill and we'll walk down to the
sea. I want to see if it's as clear as they say it is.</quote>
   <p>They took off their shoes, and the sand was soft and smooth
beneath their feet. By the time they came to the sea the lights of
the terrace looked a long way off. Rob bent and put his hand in the
water. It was warm and still.
   <p>Gaby said impishly, <quote>Let's paddle. No one can see us from
there.</quote>
   <p>Rob tucked up his trousers and she kicked her nylons towards the
high, white sandals. They waded into the shallow water.
   <p><quote>Look across there.</quote> He pointed the way they had driven
earlier. The whole coast was like a strip of twinkling stars. <quote>We
could be on an island, cut off from all those people there. In fact,
I wish we were. I don't want to go back.</quote>
   <p><quote>Neither do I, Rob. If you are going to stay, then I shall stay
with you.</quote>
   <p>He turned towards her. Her face looked very pale in the
darkness. A strange, burning feeling was creeping over his body. He
felt as though he were poised on the brink of some new, wonderful
experience.
   <p><quote>Gaby...</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, Rob?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, Gaby, Gaby!</quote>
   <p>Her lips were cool and smooth under his, and her cheeks were
like silk. He held her, wanting to retain this moment all his life,
the two of them in the warm, shimmering darkness, rocking gently to
and fro in the rustling water.
   <p>When at last he released her, he was still feeling dizzy from the
impact. Without speaking they gripped each other's hands, and walked
back to the dry sand and sat down.
   <p>Gaby started to rub at her feet with a wisp of a handkerchief.
She had amazingly small feet. But everything about her was petite.
   <p>She said at last, <quote>I've been waiting a long time for you to do
that, Rob.</quote>
   <p><quote>You have?</quote> He was amazed. Then his arm came round her bare
shoulders. <quote>I suppose I've wanted it too, but I've been afraid.</quote>
   <p><quote>Afraid?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. Afraid that you would push me away, and then everything
would have been over before it started. I couldn't have stood that.
I think I felt this way about you the moment I saw you at the Savoy
party. People laugh about love at first sight, but sometimes it's
true &mdash; only you don't see it at the time.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then you do love me?</quote> she said slowly.
   <p><quote>Oh, yes. You've hit me like... like a boomerang.</quote>
   <p><quote>And what about...?</quote>
   <p><quote>... Diana? Yes, I know.</quote> Was it only this morning that he
had told Diana he loved her? He had believed it then, and in an odd
sort of way it was still true. He did love Diana, but it was nothing
like this flame that blazed within him when he was with Gaby. The man
who first said there were many faces of love was right. He went on
slowly, <quote>I don't know what to say about her. I can't let her down
just like that, yet one day it will have to come. I can see that
now.</quote>
   <p><quote>Rob.</quote> She rested her head against his shoulder. Her perfume
had none of the gentle scent of Diana's. It was some excitingly
subtle blend that tore at his senses. <quote>We have our careers to think
of first of all. I think it would be best to go for a little while as
we were, seeing more of each other perhaps, getting to know each
other, but doing nothing definite. A romance can do no harm to our
publicity at the moment, but marriage must wait. Don't you agree?</quote>
   <p><quote>I suppose so. But it's you I want above everything.</quote> He was
startled that she put their publicity so firmly before their private
life, but she was probably right; there was still time to get to know
more about each other. Aloud he said, <quote>I never imagined anything
like this would happen when we both were invited to Monte Carlo.</quote>
   <p><quote>And would you still have come if you had guessed, Rob?</quote> she
asked quietly.
   <p>He smiled into the darkness. <quote>Yes, I would. Of course I would,
that's the glorious part of it. Oh, Gaby!</quote> He turned and kissed
her again, running his hand through her hair. <quote>I think I must be the
luckiest man in the world.</quote>
   <p>They lay on the sand a little longer, talking, listening to the
sound of the sea, and the breeze rustling through the pine trees
behind them, and just dreaming. Then Gaby said, <quote>Rob, if you want
to stop for a few moments at Cannes, perhaps we had better go.
Tomorrow night will be exhausting. I shall never be able to face
it.</quote>
   <p>He jumped up. <quote>I had forgotten all about tomorrow. How selfish
of me. It doesn't seem quite real somehow, after this.</quote>
   <p>He drove along the coast in high spirits, their voices joining in
the liquid melody of their new song. At Cannes he parked near the
harbour, and they found a pavement caf&eacute; and sat for a while,
watching the boats and drinking black coffee.
   <p><quote>Funny,</quote> he mused. <quote>This is what I always imagined myself
doing in the South of France, sitting idly, drinking coffee, watching
the people and the boats. And aren't some of the boats fabulous?</quote>
   <p>They lit up the harbour, some miniature liners, launches, speed
boats and small, colourful sailing dinghies. They seemed joined in a
community of their own.
   <p>He and Gaby watched in silence, holding hands. For the moment
everything had been said. They were content merely to be together.
Reluctantly then, they went back to the car and to the hotel.
   <p>Outside Gaby's room he said, <quote>I wonder what time band call will
be?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've heard in the morning, but I'm not sure.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then we'll have time for a swim in the afternoon. Is that a
date?</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a date. Goodnight, Rob, and thank you.</quote> She put up her
face for his kiss. <quote>Sweet dreams.</quote>
   <p><quote>They'll be sweet all right. I shall be dreaming of you.</quote>
   <p>He drew back the curtains and let the sea breeze in before he got
into bed. He lay awake for a long time, thinking about the evening
and the whole day that lay ahead. It was all too short, but he
intended to hold on to it tightly with both hands.
   <p>He breakfasted alone, learning with disappointment that Gaby was
having hers in her room. He had been particularly looking forward to
this, breakfast in the cool of the morning on the broad terrace,
looking straight out to sea. There would have been something
particularly intimate about it. He toyed with the warm rolls and
cherry jam, but drank two large cups of coffee.
   <p>Their call came about eleven o'clock. He went up and knocked on
Gaby's door.
   <p><quote>I missed you this morning,</quote> he said, when they drew apart.
   <p><quote>You'll have to get used to my bad morning habits,</quote> she teased
him. <quote>I never get up unless I have to. Even for someone like
you.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll try to remember. Shall we go now?</quote> He reached for her
hand. She looked this morning as though she had stepped straight out
of the sunshine. She wore a full white skirt of some silky material
and a yellow top. She looked slim and tiny and he badly wanted to
protect her.
   <p>They worked hard for the rest of the morning. The producer
wanted nothing less than perfection. Again and again the same acts
were called for a repeat. Rob watched, amazed, as many more
professional stars than himself were made to run through their words
or their music five or six times.
   <p>It was a cosmopolitan gathering of stars. There were English,
American, French, Italian, and a couple from Brazil. Rob began by
feeling overawed before realizing that most of them had probably come
up the same way as he had.
   <p>The rehearsal finished at last and they all trooped in to lunch,
arguing good-humouredly about how the evening's performance should be
staged. Rob did not have a chance to be alone with Gaby until after
three o'clock when most of the others had gone to their rooms to rest.
   <p><quote>Still game for a swim?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>I'll fetch my things and be with you in five minutes.</quote>
   <p>For half an hour they splashed about in the water, more clear and
blue than Rob had believed possible. Then they lay in long
deck-chairs, dozing under their striped umbrellas.
   <p>Rob reached for Gaby's hand after a few minutes, but she was
asleep, looking as deeply at peace as a young child.
   <p>He lay back in his chair.

<head>CHAPTER ONE</head>
<head>Southern Ireland August, 1940</head>
   <p>DUSK WAS softening the coastline of County Kerry as Diana
West turned reluctantly from her window to go downstairs.
   <p>She hesitated on the landing, remembering that Gregory disliked
cr&egrave;pe-soled  brogues and tweeds, and knowing that he would
make some barbed remark about her wearing her
<quote>Lady-Bountiful-uniform</quote> in the gracious drawing-room of Rosebrae.
Six months of being Mrs. Gregory West had taught Diana that the
only thing to do was to grow a protective shell and to let her
husband's arrowed words glance off unnoticed. Not that they hurt any
the less for being ignored; sometimes the ache and the bewilderment
and the disillusion was so fierce that the future became a burden to
be endured and never never a happiness to be anticipated.
   <p>Now, her young mouth set and a bleak expression in her dark brown
eyes, she went down to where an elderly manservant was beckoning to
her from the hall.
   <p><quote>You're late,</quote> he reproved. <quote>I was nearly coming to fetch
you. Come in here a minute, Miss Diana, there's a thing I have to
show you before you go in there.</quote>
   <p>He nodded towards the drawing-room and then steered her into the
unlit butler's pantry next door.
   <p><quote>But, Fergus &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Wheesht! Stay here &mdash; I'll be right back.</quote>
   <p>With a faint smile Diana leaned on the table in front of her and
prepared to wait as Fergus had ordered. He had been her father's
batman in the First World War and for twenty years after that he had
bullied and served and adored the whole family, with the exception of
his master's sister Miss Charlotte Cavendish. <quote>A poor fool woman,</quote>
was the kindest thing he had ever said of her, and angry tears stood
in his eyes when his master's will was read and he heard that his
beloved and orphaned Diana was left in the care of Miss Charlotte.
His dislike and distrust were returned in full measure by that lady
and by Gregory West, but he was Diana's man and she would as soon do
without an arm as do without her oldest friend, Fergus Burke.
   <p>A moment after Fergus left the pantry Diana became aware of a bar
of light in the dimness, and moving along a bit she saw that the
serving hatch was slightly open at one side giving a narrow view of
the drawing-room. Without curiosity because it was such a familiar
scene, Diana watched her aunt presiding behind the tea-tray.
Firelight gleamed on silver and fine china, and lamplight flattered
the smooth skin and fading fair hair of Miss Charlotte.
   <p><quote>Diana's late again,</quote> she said, passing a plate of hot
buttered scones to Gregory. <quote>Really, we don't see much of her at all
these days.</quote>
   <p>He shrugged. <quote>She's probably taking soup or whatever it is to
her ghastly villagers. Beats me how she can bear to enter their
hovels!</quote>
   <p><quote>Do try not to be any more ignorant than you already are!</quote>
Miss Charlotte snapped. <quote>You seem to have taken all your ideas about
what you call <squote>the landed gentry</squote> from Victorian novels. Diana has
lots of responsibilities here and you ought to help her out with some
of them instead of sitting around here like an ornament. And you
needn't glare at me like that! We know each other too well for either
of us to put on an act when we're alone, and if I hadn't had a soft
spot for your father long ago I would have left you to go to the devil
in your own way!</quote>
   <p>Diana drew back from the hatch, her mind a riot of emotions as
she realised that she was deliberately eavesdropping and that her aunt
and Gregory weren't strangers as they had led everyone to believe.
   <p>Fergus gripped her arm and she jumped. <quote>This is no time for
party manners!</quote> he hissed. <quote>Many a choice bit I've heard here and
I thought it was time you heard it too. They're in a girning mood
today and that's why I wanted you down earlier, so keep your ears
skint!</quote>
   <p>Without a scuffle Diana couldn't get away from the determined
Fergus, and almost against her will she looked once more into the
drawing-room.
   <p><quote>And another thing,</quote> Miss Charlotte was saying, <quote>we didn't
finish what we were talking about when tea was brought in. Diana will
soon be twenty-one and I have no intention of being done out of my
share of our bargain just because you can't hold her.</quote>
   <p>Gregory laughed softly and smoothed his brown wavy hair. <quote>I can
get any woman, and keep her. Every woman needs to be shown who's
master and in the end they love it, and Diana's no different.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh yes she is. You can't class girls like Diana with the
<squote>women</squote> you've known. She was fresh home from finishing school &mdash;
and heaven knows it might as well have been an enclosed convent for
all she knew of life &mdash; you swept her off her feet, and she was all
prepared to love you for ever. But what happens? You seem to have
frightened her to death, because she's just a shadow of the girl she
was six months ago. I'm warning you, Gregory, when a Cavendish digs
her toes in neither you nor any man living will move her.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're just getting anxious about your twenty thousand quid,</quote>
Gregory muttered, but some of the assurance had gone from his voice.
<quote>Oh all right, just to please you I'll start being the niminy-piminy
lover she seems to expect, but honestly, Charlotte, she's such an
innocent and she always looks so &mdash; so untouched that any man would
lose patience and want to bring her down to earth.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not any man,</quote> Miss Charlotte said coldly, and anger
glinted in her pale eyes. <quote>Your father may have been a bit of a
rogue but he was also a gentleman, and that you will never be. He
would have kept his sights fixed on the Cavendish wealth and he would
have had Diana eating out of his hand until she would have begged him
to take over the management of her money when she was twenty-one. I
begin to regret that I groomed you for this part for which you have
turned out to be so manifestly unsuited, but if you don't hand over to
me that twenty thousand pounds within a month or two after Diana's
birthday be very sure that all the regrets will be yours.</quote>
   <p>A wave of nausea hit Diana and she bent over to rest her clammy
forehead on her hands. Beside her, Fergus muttered black oaths and
heaped imprecations on the two conspirators, his hand resting gently
on her bowed head. Then the bell tinkled above their heads and he
smoothed his jacket before going into the drawing-room.
   <p><quote>I'll say you're not home yet,</quote> he whispered. <quote>You'll need
time to think. But lassie, I had to do it, I just had to do it.</quote>
   <p>Left alone, Diana straightened and looked dully at the hatch. No
one ever remembered that it was there as it was never used. On the
other side it looked like part of the white panelling, as did the one
on the opposite wall of the pantry which led to the dining-room and
which was used every day. Neither Miss Charlotte nor Gregory were
welcome in Fergus's domain, and it was unlikely that either of them
had ever been inside his pantry.
   <p>Knowing that she didn't want to talk to anyone, not even to
Fergus, Diana ran quietly across the hall to the garden-room and
taking the first coat she could find she left the house by the side
door. Clouds obscured what little light there was in the sky, but
Diana knew every path in this part of Kerry and almost blindly she
made her way to the hill above Whitewater Bay. The bay was a quiet
anchorage on a rocky part of coast, but privacy was jealously guarded
by Captain James Wallace who owned the biggest estate in the area, and
no villager from Morne ever went near the little beach.
   <p>Diana didn't know &mdash; and at the moment she didn't care &mdash; if
Captain Wallace had ever seen her on the hillside or not, but she
never did any harm just by sitting on the sheltered side of the big
grey rock below the skyline. The slope in front of her was steep but
it wasn't very far down to the beach where the waves swished gently on
the shingle.
   <p>How long she sat there she never knew, thoughts chasing endlessly
through her mind.
   <p><quote>Sold,</quote> she whispered once. <quote>Sold like a sheep at a Kerry
Fair. But it wasn't my fault &mdash; I've never come up against people like
my aunt and Gregory &mdash; oh, of course it was my own fault, dreaming
of a knight in shining armour and thinking I'd found him in Gregory &mdash;
how funny that is &mdash; Gregory! a new-style Sir Lancelot! &mdash; it's really
terribly funny when you think about it &mdash;</quote>
   <p>And suddenly the laughter which shook her turned to tears and she
rested her cheek against the cold grey rock and cried as she hadn't
done since the death of her father ten years before.
   <p>It was the memory of her father which calmed her at last, and she
sat motionless as she recalled his unfailing light-heartedness even
when the pain of an old war wound racked him; his deep love for her,
and his sorrow that she had never known the mother who had died when
she was an infant; his affection for his wife's beautiful home in
Kerry and for the people of Morne whom he viewed with tolerant and
amused English eyes.
   <p>I'm English really, Diana thought, and it's in England I should
be now and not skulking over here in a neutral country when my own
people are at war with Germany. Or I could go over the border to
Ulster and try to do something useful for a change instead of running
an estate on more money than I'll ever know what to do with.
   <p>Money. Her expression hardened as she thought of the two who
were haggling so shabbily in the Rosebrae drawing-room. Well, they
were going to be disappointed this time. There would be no control of
her inheritance by Gregory, and no twenty thousand pounds for Aunt
Charlotte who no doubt felt she had earned it by introducing the son
of an old love to her niece.
   <p>Diana tensed suddenly as a low murmur of voices reached her and
then she heard the crunch of heavy boots on the stones of the pathway
just above her head. She kept very still as two men passed by, aware
that Miss Diana of Rosebrae &mdash; few people had ever called her Mrs.
West &mdash; would look rather silly if she were found on the Captain's land
with her eyes red and her face all streaked with tears. Gregory
hadn't gone down well with the locals but there was no need to
proclaim her own misery in front of them even if they had proved to be
better judges of a man than she had been.
   <p>She looked cautiously round the edge of the rock beside her and
saw that against the lightening sky the two men stood out fairly
clearly and that they both carried rifles in the crooks of their arms
as they patrolled the little headland.
   <p>Diana frowned. The voices had had a clipped intonation unlike
the soft speech of Kerry, but of course Captain Wallace was a law unto
himself and there was no one to say him nay if he wished to employ
non-local gamekeepers and to have them patrol his bounds after dark.
But such doings were alien to a simple place like Morne, and without
knowing why, Diana was glad that her coat was one she had bought and
worn at school in Paris, a soft grey wool which blended with the rock
against which she was leaning.

<text id=LOBP12>
He realised that she was also wiping her eyes. He hated having to
hurt her, but he had known ever since he had announced his engagement
to Hyacinth, that he would have to talk seriously to his ex-wife. He
had suspected her of wanting to renew their relationship before she
accepted Charles Rawlings, but afterwards he had believed that she had
found happiness with the bluff sailor and he'd been genuinely glad &mdash;
until this holiday in Singapore. Then it had occurred to him that she
had not got over their disastrous marriage.
   <p><quote>I'll &mdash; try and make Charles a good wife,</quote> she said when she
had controlled herself and turned to face him. <quote>He is &mdash; devoted to
me, and I know he will make an excellent husband. I have already told
him about you, and &mdash; and he is prepared to forget it. He believes
that it is possible for two people situated as we are to have a
platonic friendship.</quote>
   <p><quote>And you know that's true, Biddy.</quote>
   <p>She shook her head.
   <p><quote>I don't think that a man and woman who have lived together can
ever be friends; sex is bound to enter into their relationship....
Perhaps you are right.</quote> She made a determined effort to speak
naturally. <quote>It would have been a bad mistake to try and pick up the
threads again. You always were a devil, Nick, and I'm sorry for the
girl you marry, whether she is Hyacinth or &mdash; someone else.</quote>
   <p><quote>If it is not Hyacinth it will be no one,</quote> he assured her.
<quote>But meanwhile, I must find her. If only I had a clue where to look
for her.</quote>
   <p><quote>Has it occurred to you that when you told her about &mdash; us it was
such a shock to her that she has run away.</quote>
   <p><quote>If that had been the case she would have left a letter or a
message, surely?</quote> he protested.
   <p><quote>She might have wanted to punish you; to make you half frantic
on her account, and if so, she has succeeded admirably.</quote>
   <p><quote>I am sure Hyacinth would not be so childish,</quote> he retorted.
   <p><quote>It's just possible that she did leave a letter and it
hasn't been delivered yet,</quote> said Bridget. <quote>What about Tu Kota &mdash;
perhaps he knows what has happened to her?</quote>
   <p><quote>As soon as Charles comes back I'll send for him.</quote>
   <p>The Vice-Admiral returned a few minutes later, his face very
grave.
   <p><quote>Miss Chalmers did leave the hotel last night,</quote> he said.
<quote>She was seen going down the servants' staircase. Those on duty
took her to be a Eurasian sewing maid; she went out very quickly and
spoke to no one. One of the boys who was just going off at the time
saw her walking to the corner of Empress Place, where she got into a
ricksha.</quote>
   <p><quote>Did he notice the number of the ricksha?</quote> asked Nick eagerly.
   <p><quote>He says not.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then &mdash; he probably recognised the coolie who drew it? These
boys know the ricksha coolies by sight. Once we can find the fellow
we shall also find where Hyacinth went. There's no time to be
lost.</quote>
   <p><quote>The boy says that the coolie was a stranger to him; he had
never seen him before. I think he was speaking the truth; there was
no reason for him to lie.</quote>
   <p><quote>Damn!</quote> Nick pounded his clenched fist on the table. <quote>If
only he had kept his eyes open! In which direction did the ricksha
go?</quote>
   <p><quote>He didn't wait to see; there was a great crowd in the streets
last night, owing to the Chinese festival, and it was easy enough to
lose sight of a ricksha. I am afraid, Nick, old fellow, that we shall
have to ask the police to help us, for there has been a very sinister
development.</quote>
   <p><quote>You &mdash; mean...?</quote>
   <p><quote>That Malay boy, Tu Kota, is missing; he, too, didn't sleep in
the hotel last night; he has not been seen since just before midnight,
and he told no one where he was going.</quote>
<head>2</head>
   <p><quote>There you are!</quote> exclaimed Bridget. <quote>Hyacinth was not
alone; granted she's run away, but she took Tu Kota with her; and I
can assure you that she'll be quite safe with him. Don't look at me
like that, Charles, I'd trust that boy anywhere. He is perfectly
reliable. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Hyacinth has returned to
Lipur.</quote>
   <p><quote>But she wouldn't do that. How could she, when your brother is
there alone!</quote>
   <p><quote>Perhaps that's why,</quote> said Bridget, then as both men looked
blank, she cried. <quote>Oh, how stupid you two are! Didn't Edward
propose to her? She may have decided to accept him after all, and
he'll lose no time in marrying her; he won't give her a chance to slip
through his fingers again.</quote>
   <p><quote>We must get in touch with Lipur at once!</quote> cried Nick.
<head>3</head>
   <p>But it was not so easy to get in touch with Lipur; there had been
a heavy storm twenty-four hours previously, and telephonic
communications with the district had been cut, and with Pekama. Nick
managed to get on to the nearest estate and they promised to send a
runner to Lipur with a message for Edward Grampian, and when they
received his reply, telephone it at once to Singapore. Meanwhile,
Charles Rawlings systematically called on all the people Hyacinth had
known, and questioned the officers who had dined with them the
previous night, but none of them had seen Hyacinth, nor could give any
clue to account for her disappearance. It was a complete mystery.
   <p>When the following day had dawned and she had still not returned
and there was no news of her, both the men realised that they must
approach the police. Nick had not slept all night and looked haggard;
he was so restless that he couldn't bear to sit still. Even Bridget
was no longer suggesting that the girl had been caught out in an
escapade; if she had been she'd have been back long ago.
   <p><quote>But there's still a chance that she went to Lipur,</quote> she
insisted. <quote>And you mustn't worry too much, Nick. If Tu Kota is with
her; he'll look after her.</quote>
   <p><quote>The boy who saw her get into the ricksha said she was alone.</quote>
   <p><quote>It may not have been Hyacinth; he couldn't swear to it. It may
really have been one of the Eurasian sewing maids.</quote>
   <p><quote>He said she was wearing a light coat and a gauzy scarf round
her head, and those are two of the articles missing from Hyacinth's
wardrobe.</quote>
   <p><quote>It may be just a coincidence,</quote> said Bridget. <quote>I shouldn't
pin too much faith on that. Wait until we have heard from Lipur.</quote>
   <p>But Charles Rawlings agreed with Nick that they could not afford
to wait, and he offered to go to the police. He knew them and could
impress upon them the need for as little publicity as possible,
though, of course, if publicity would help to find the girl, then they
must employ it.
   <p>The girls and Nick should have returned to the country today, but
with Hyacinth missing, it was unthinkable that they should leave
Singapore. Nick had done everything possible to discover her
whereabouts, but from the moment she had stepped into the ricksha it
was as if the earth had opened and swallowed her.
   <p>He decided to go and make some tactful enquiries in the Chinese
quarter; not that he expected to find Hyacinth there, but someone
might have seen her. Nick himself had many acquaintances in the
Chinese quarter, friends from the war days, and he knew he could rely
on them to do everything possible to help him.
   <p>He was just about to leave the hotel on his quest when one of the
clerks in the reception desk &mdash; a young educated Malay &mdash; came up to
him.
   <p><quote>Mr. Trelawney, sir ... about the young lady....</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> replied Nick, suppressing his eagerness with an effort.
   <p><quote>I have made a discovery, sir. It may be of no account, but I
think that you will find it &mdash; interesting. If we could go up to your
room, sir....</quote>
   <p>Nick wondered if he was about to be touched by a blackmailer, but
the young man sounded genuine enough.
   <p><quote>Very well,</quote> he said. <quote>Come with me now.</quote>
   <p>Once in his room he closed and locked the door, then faced the
Malay.
   <p><quote>What is it?</quote> he asked. <quote>If it's information which will lead
to the finding of Miss Chalmers I'll make it well worth your
while....</quote>
   <p><quote>As I said, sir, it may be of no value, but briefly, I have some
scraps of paper which the boy who cleans her room found in her waste
paper basket. I thought they might be a clue.</quote> He took an envelope
out of his pocket, and emptied a number of twisted scraps of paper on
to the desk in the window. Nick saw that they contained words printed
in block letters, and that some of them had been part of an envelope.
   <p><quote>When were these found?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>Yesterday morning, sir. I was passing when I saw the boy
emptying the waste paper basket, and I gave him a coin to let me have
the contents and not say a word about it to anyone.</quote>
   <p>Nick was already sorting the scraps of paper.
   <p><quote>Have you put them together?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>No sir.</quote> But Nick guessed that the Malay was lying; he had
put them together and then crumpled them up again. He thrust his
hand into his pocket and handed a note to the man.
   <p><quote>Keep your mouth shut, do you understand?</quote>
   <p>Nick gave up all thought of going to the Chinese quarter; he had
glimpsed one significant word, and he was determined to piece the
whole of the scraps together, no matter how long it took him.
   <p>It was over two hours before he had finished, and then he had the
entire message and the envelope.

<quote>
   <p>If Missie Chalmers wishes to know about Mr. Trelawney's
business in Singapore, a ricksha will be waiting at the corner of
Empress Place tonight at midnight, to take her to the lady known as
Chinese Lily. Come veiled and say nothing of this. It concerns
Missie's happiness.
<QUOTE/>

   <p>So that was it! Someone was anxious to break his engagement to
Hyacinth, and had sent her this damnable note which she ought to have
brought straight to him. But she had not done so and had undoubtedly
gone off in the ricksha which had been sent for her; the boy who had
seen her get in it had told the truth. But where had she been taken?
And why hadn't she returned? Who was at the back of all this?
Chinese Lily? He could not think so. He had always regarded her as
his very good friend, though one could never be quite sure when
dealing with an Oriental. It might be that the announcement of his
engagement had roused some dormant demon in her and she'd had Hyacinth
kidnapped. But she had congratulated him and told him she was very
happy for him when he had spoken of his fianc&eacute;e the other night.
   <p>Who else could be at the bottom of this attempt to get hold of
Hyacinth? Attempt, he thought angrily. It was no attempt; it was an
accomplished fact. If the person had just wanted to put her against
him she would have been back by now; the fact that she was missing
assumed a very sinister aspect.
   <p>Chinese Lily was quite capable of having a European girl
kidnapped if she wanted to do so. She was utterly fearless, and had
been too long associated with the underworld not to know exactly how
to set about it. He knew that certain girls who had been in her
employ during the war and had chatted too much to the Japanese had
simply disappeared, and as one girl was as good as another to the
occupying troops &mdash; and if any special man was interested in the girls
in question, Chinese Lily always saw that there were others, even more
attractive &mdash; no awkward questions were asked.

<text id=LOBP13>
This might account for much that puzzled her.
   <p><quote>Mollie, there's no sense in stalling when we both know our own
minds. I've had girls before but never the real thing until now.
I've been waiting for you darling. Thank God I found you in
time...</quote>
   <p>Again the premonition shook her. What did he mean?
   <p><quote>I've been waiting for you too,</quote> she said shyly. <quote>It's so
simple really, isn't it?</quote>
   <p>Either you were one of the lucky ones and met your fate, or you
weren't &mdash; and didn't. The world was a different place because she and
Nigel had met. She drew a steadying breath, realising how near they
had come to missing each other. If he'd gone to America they might
never have met. Somewhere across the world he would have roamed about
seeking her &mdash; while she would have stayed home, doing the job nearest
to her, but empty and unhappy. The thought brought the misty feeling
back to her eyes. They were lucky.
   <p><quote>You feel as I do, so it couldn't be better,</quote> he whispered.
<quote>Let's get out of here when I can do more than talk.</quote>
   <p>Mollie followed him, bemused with happiness. She moved on a
cloud, floating effortlessly out to the car. They got in without a
word, and he drove on, careless of direction, intent only on getting
her alone.
   <p><quote>Now.</quote> He slammed on the brake, drew into a lay-by.
<quote>Darling girl...</quote>
   <p>They were in a leafy lane, hedges high about them, the evening
closing in slowly. It had not rained after all. She turned to him,
her face showing her love and understanding.
   <p><quote>Nigel &mdash; I love you.</quote>
   <p><quote>I know. I feel it here.</quote> He touched his broad chest, before
drawing her into his arms. She trembled at his touch, realising his
complete domination over her will. She had read of such things
happening to others, but this was her first experience and she was
unafraid. His cheek rested against hers, he held her close, and for
the moment was content.
   <p><quote>I love you. Thank God I found you in time.</quote>
   <p>She touched his face gently with her lips. <quote>It's wonderful. I
didn't know it would be like this.</quote>
   <p><quote>I did &mdash; with the right girl. We must be married at once,
Mollie. I can't stand anything else. You must agree.</quote>
   <p>Could any promise made before this moment really count? She
subdued the rising uneasiness, wanting to promise Nigel anything he
demanded.
   <p>As if he read her thoughts he said: <quote>Your guardians haven't a
hope of holding you to a promise made before we met. I'll talk them
round. They can't withhold permission once we're determined.</quote>
   <p>She laughed softly against his ear. <quote>It's remotely possible
that they won't be swept off their feet as I have been...</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll make a fight for it, won't you?</quote> The words were an
intimate whisper, and seemed to carry them forward more than anything
yet.
   <p><quote>Yes. Oh, I will. I will.</quote>
   <p><quote>I want us to belong from the first possible moment.</quote>
   <p><quote>So do I.</quote> She wondered at herself, but no other answer
was possible. <quote>I'm spineless &mdash; I'd no idea it took one this
way.</quote> Perhaps it wasn't always so. Perhaps other men were not as
fascinating as Nigel, with his Viking appeal. She studied him
quietly, seeing the strength in his face, that backed his
handsomeness.
   <p>He began to kiss her mouth, deliberately trying to rouse her,
experiencing the first thrill of her being as she responded. He was
quick to follow this with a more intimate embrace.
   <p><quote>I'm the first,</quote> he mused against her soft lips. <quote>The very
first. I can tell &mdash; and I'm glad. I wanted to be first &mdash; with the
one woman. You've never been kissed before.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not this way. Just cousins and things.</quote>
   <p><quote>Things?</quote> He pretended a brief jealousy.
   <p><quote>Games &mdash; relatives &mdash; and things...</quote>
   <p><quote>Not one of them kissed you so &mdash; and so &mdash; and so...</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote> She breathed lightly, because it seemed impossible to
draw a long breath. <quote>Oh, please, Nigel...</quote> His increasing passion
was almost more than she could bear just then, yet she wanted to
respond, to be to him what he obviously wanted her to be. In the
confines of the little car it was difficult to cast off a feeling of
apprehension. She grew tense, wishing she had more experience. When
was it time to call a halt? Perhaps it was all new to him, also, so
she must go carefully. Her last wish was to hurt him, or to harm this
wonderful feeling they shared. <quote>You &mdash; you are going too fast for me,
Nigel.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't you like me to hold you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, but...</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll get used to it, adorable baby. I'm glad you're not
ready with all the answers. I always hoped for a girl like you. Most
of them drive a chap too far.</quote>
   <p>She realised that in spite of his words, he did place a brake on
himself in some way and she felt considerably relieved. He leaned
away, considering her, his eyes teasing. She felt shy again, gauche
and young.
   <p><quote>You'll have to make an honest man of me soon, darling. Let's
make plans. Definitely before I go to America! We both want
that.</quote>
   <p><quote>I may not be able to travel with you.</quote>
   <p><quote>I can scarcely bear to leave you behind even for a few
weeks.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're too impatient. Let's just be engaged for a few
months.</quote> It would be so pleasant knowing that he loved her and was
waiting for her, and they would have time to make a proper start to
their life together.
   <p><quote>No. That's not enough. You know it too, but I forgive you
because you don't realise what it means to me. We must be married,
Mollie.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well &mdash; won't it be worse if we're married &mdash; and then I can't
get out to you for months? There is all the business of the passport,
and visa, you know what it's like.</quote>
   <p><quote>I could fly back every weekend.</quote>
   <p>She laughed shakenly. <quote>You're in love.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I am in love; be gentle with me, sweet Mollie.</quote>
   <p>The appeal touched her heart. He drew her back into his embrace.
She knew then that he was too big a man to conceal his feelings from
her. His simplicity sprang from his strength of character, and was
not weakness as she had first thought.
   <p><quote>You will come to see the family at the weekend. I'll make all
necessary plans. They'll know I mean to marry you.</quote>
   <p><quote>They may feel that I'm unsuitable.</quote>
   <p><quote>It doesn't matter. It's what I want that counts now. I'm not
a boy.</quote>
   <p><quote>You must meet my guardians too,</quote> she whispered.
   <p><quote>If that's what you want me to do, but it doesn't make any
difference. I'll raise heaven and earth to get you. We've time if I
start moving tomorrow. We'll treat the trip to America as a
honeymoon.</quote>
   <p><quote>I should have thought that in this scientific age you'd be
flying to America?</quote>
   <p><quote>No. My chief is doing so, but I'm taking out some special gear
that we'll need over there. I must see to the loading and unloading,
for some of the instruments are fantastically sensitive. Whether we
reach the moon or not depends entirely on my efforts &mdash; alone and
unaided!</quote> He laughed at her crestfallen expression. <quote>I love to
tease you darling. Actually I'll manage so much better with you
along.</quote>
   <p><quote>I hope it's the right thing to do. Could it be a stumbling
block in your career later on?</quote>
   <p><quote>Our marriage? No... but you may rue the day you ever met
me.</quote>
   <p>She put both hands to his face. <quote>I'll never do that, Nigel.
I'll always understand. Men have jobs that take them out of a
woman's sphere sometimes. I'll not be jealous of your work. At least
I hope I won't.</quote>
   <p>They sat for an hour, bemused by their happiness, feeling that
all things were possible. The tremendous difficulties ahead began to
dissolve beneath their sanguine hopes. Night was closing in when
Nigel thrust both hands through his thick hair and sat erect. He
pressed the self-starter grimly.
   <p><quote>We'll call it a day. I must see Terence tonight and tell him
our news. I must also be in London before breakfast. Don't forget
your promise to spend next weekend with me at home.</quote>
   <p>She sat back, knowing that he was leading and she must follow.
She felt depressed when she remembered the promise made to her
guardians. Would they understand that this feeling for Nigel was
something she had not foreseen?
   <p><quote>Are you regretting anything?</quote> Nigel said, as he drew up in
front of the stone steps leading to the main hall of the college.
<quote>Wait &mdash; we didn't say goodbye.</quote> It was a stormy, protracted
farewell, which bewildered her. Nothing could possibly be as
important as this. He opened the car door for her, following quickly
on to the steps. <quote>I'll see you in, darling.</quote>
   <p><quote>It really isn't necessary...</quote> Yet it was comforting to know
herself protected. She went up the steps ahead of him. The door
opened before they reached it.
   <p>Terence stood looking down at them. His expression was cold,
utterly unreadable. He was not in the least like Nigel then. He was
wearing a navy double-breasted suit and looked formal and stiff to
her. Some of the stiffness was in his bearing, and she realised in
surprise that he was angry &mdash; very angry. For an instant she
hesitated. She felt that Nigel was momentarily startled too. They'd
both forgotten about Terence.
   <p><quote>So there you are.</quote> Terence spoke first, through set lips.
<quote>I might have known you'd be together. You could have given me a
hint, Nigel.</quote>
   <p><quote>None of your business &mdash; was it?</quote> Nigel said.
   <p>Mollie glanced from one to the other in keen dismay. It was to
Terence that she made her appeal. Why was he so angry? <quote>Please,
Terence...</quote>
   <p>His cold smile did not reach his eyes. <quote>All right.</quote>
   <p>She looked back at Nigel, seeing his mocking smile as if he
appreciated Terence's temper. There was a tiny silence, which she did
not try to break.
   <p><quote>Now you're here you can give me a lift back, Nigel.</quote> Terence
was trying to recover lost ground, but finding it difficult.
   <p>Mollie was so unprepared for this open antagonism between the two
men that she did not know how to cope. Dismay held her silent and
uncomfortable. Had they quarrelled earlier in the day? She thought
Terence looked white and wondered why he was there, as if awaiting
them.
   <p><quote>Don't be in such a hurry to push me off,</quote> Nigel drawled as if
amused. <quote>It may interest you to know that Mollie and I are engaged &mdash;
we'll make it official as from next weekend. We are to be married as
soon after that as I can manage it &mdash; any objections, old man?</quote>
   <p>The silence was quite terrifying to Mollie as she looked up at
Terence. What was wrong? She had not known either of them long
enough to guess at the source of the trouble, and she had certainly
not been guilty of flirting with either of them.
   <p>Terence made an effort to answer the challenge. He was a more
slender man than Nigel, but still stood about six feet tall. He felt
mechanically in his pocket for a cigarette, and they waited as he
lighted it.
   <p><quote>Congratulations,</quote> he said, puffing out a cloud of smoke.
   <p>Nigel grinned and waved a hand in an airy salute, evidently
knowing that he could not at that moment expect more from his brother.
<quote>Thank you.</quote>
   <p>Had Terence expected this would happen, and had tried to save his
brother from committing himself? Nigel had hinted that she was not
the first girl in his life, and she realised with a fresh pang that he
had seemed thoroughly experienced in the way he'd tried to rouse her.
   <p><quote>Aren't you going to kiss your future sister-in-law?</quote> Nigel
said.
   <p><quote>I'll claim that privilege on the wedding day.</quote> Terence
turned away.
   <p>Nigel stared hard at him, not too pleased, but for once bereft of
words.

<text id=LOBP14>
   <p>Lois did so, deftly removed her scarf and gloves and followed
her friend into the house. Bertie and Robert were in the living-room
which, despite the bright fire, had a cold, unused appearance, natural
enough considering that Bertie preferred the kitchen and Joan was
always too busy to sit down anywhere.
   <p>Lois's arrival seemed to warm and enliven the atmosphere, and, as
Joan had predicted, there were no gaps in the conversation. She was
not in the least self-conscious and so obviously bubbling over with
youthful high spirits that the two men could be almost seen to
thaw in her presence. Before she came, there had been a slight
stiffness, due chiefly to the fact that they were practically
strangers with little in common.
   <p>Joan brought in tea, tiny, diamond-shaped sandwiches and cake.
Waiting on the others, she was a little hurt by their attitude.
Bertie, as usual, expected to have everything done for him and
Robert's attention was given to Lois. Every now and then he would
turn to Joan, including her in the conversation, but she could not
help feeling that he regarded her as a mere child, the little girl who
had been the Rose Queen &mdash; even though he had forgotten her! Whereas,
he treated Lois in a subtly different manner. More like a woman,
thought Joan, though she was three years younger than herself. It
must always be like that, she supposed. The pretty ones got
everything! And Lois was essentially feminine, although it would have
been unfair to dismiss her as a mere flirt. She was interested in
men, her looks and manner aroused their interest. <squote>And I,</squote> thought
Joan, <squote>am interested only in Robert. As for my looks, they don't
amount to a row of pins in contrast with what Lois has to offer.</squote>
   <p>After tea, they sat round the fire. When Bertie had visualised
Joan taking Robert on a tour of the property, he had forgotten how
short the afternoons were. Darkness was already gathering, and when
it became necessary for Joan to excuse herself in order to feed the
hens, there was still no chance for him to be alone with Lois. Robert
was left to play third whether he liked it or not. Apparently he did.
He and Lois were getting on splendidly together.
   <p><quote>I thought you were a hermit, Mr. Hepworth. Joan says you've
been away, but I pictured you shut up at Silverstone, the windows
shuttered, the tradesmen leaving just enough food outside the back
door.</quote>
   <p>Robert looked at her with amusement. <quote>Are you disappointed?</quote>
   <p><quote>Quite the reverse, but I do wish you were married.</quote>
   <p>Robert laughed outright. <quote>You're a bit young to be a
match-maker. It's a favourite hobby of those who can't &mdash; well, match
themselves!</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, I don't bother about most people, but if you had a
wife, it would be such fun. She would be living in the largest house
for miles, and she'd give lovely parties and everything would be gay.
Larchwood is a bit flat, you know. My stepmother plays bridge and
that's awful. You should see their faces, as solemn as if they were
at a funeral and if you dare interrupt they chop your head off. There
are the church bazaars, too, and outings and amateur theatricals and
the Women's Institute, but nothing can be compared to the parties your
wife would give.</quote>
   <p>Bertie was frowning at her, afraid that Robert would imagine she
was giving him too broad a hint. It was a bit much the way she
was carrying on, he reflected. Of course, she was so sweet and
innocent she didn't realise she might be giving a false impression.
   <p><quote>Lois works at Mrs. Harris's Dress Shop in Waverley,</quote> he
told Robert. <quote>I expect she's thinking how good it would be for trade
if there was a touch more social life here. She's gifted at her
job.</quote>
   <p>He glanced at her with pride, glad to show her in a different
light from the one produced by her own scatter-brained chatter.
   <p>Lois threw up her pretty little soft hands in a gesture of
protest.
   <p><quote>You ought to hear Mrs. Harris's opinion of me! The things I
forget! The things I don't do! She'd have fired me long ago if it
wasn't for my figure. I can model clothes, you see. She has to admit
they look better on me than on any of the other girls, and that makes
the customers more inclined to give an order.</quote>
   <p>Feeling a trifle out of his depth, Robert said: <quote>Do you like
your job, Miss Wade?</quote>
   <p><quote>I would if the clothes were real.</quote>
   <p>Robert floundered deeper than ever, and, seeing his expression of
bewilderment, she added: <quote>Mrs. Harris has to please her customers
and they're mostly farmers' wives or just the locals. Not that she
could fly higher. She hasn't got it in her. But, if I never marry, I
shall try to get a job in London, modelling. I get fed up with
ordinary clothes, garments. I'd like a real creation.</quote>
   <p>Her eyes were large and dreamy as if gazing upon some celestial
vision. How odd women were, thought Robert, amazed at her reverence
for what he considered so trivial. Bertie, however, pounced on one
sentence of hers.
   <p><quote>How d'you mean if you never marry? Of course you'll marry.
There isn't any never about it.</quote>
   <p>At this moment, Joan re-entered the room. Tom had managed to
escape having to accompany his wife to evening service, and, in what
Joan considered a most touching way, had insisted on finishing all the
final chores.
   <p><quote>You run along and enjoy yourself with your friends, Miss
Sutton. It's not often you get the chance of wearing a nice red dress
instead of your old blue trousers. Apron over it's all right with
chicken, but, with the old sow there's bound to be trouble. Rub
herself against you as likely as not, and then where will you be?</quote>
   <p><quote>Rolling in the mud, I expect, Tom,</quote> she responded,
laughingly.
   <p><quote>That's egg-zactly what I meant. You go indoors and keep
yourself nice and clean for once.</quote>
   <p>Obeying him thankfully, Joan slung her apron on to a peg, shed
her rubber boots in favour of high-heeled black shoes and combed her
hair in front of the small mirror in the kitchen.
   <p>A nice red dress, Tom had said. Probably that was how it looked
in his eyes, and she had herself chosen to wear it in preference to
her blue woollen or the tweeds, believing, hoping &mdash; even though rather
shamefacedly &mdash; that Robert would notice her and think she was pretty.
The blue suited her better, bringing out the colour of her eyes, but
she knew she must do something to distinguish herself if possible.
Lois was so fascinating that whether she wished it or not she was
always a powerful rival. The deep red colour of this dress would
surely procure its wearer a little attention.
   <p>During tea, however, Joan realised that she might just as well
have worn her ancient corduroy trousers, or swathed herself in a red
blanket! There wasn't a man in the world who would have given her a
second glance while Lois was in the room. She heaved a sigh, then
laughed at herself for being so silly and self-pitying. It was her
own fault for inviting Robert on a day when Lois would be there, and,
instead of standing about, feeling sorry for herself, she ought to be
doing something to help poor Bertie. He must be itching to get rid of
the other man.
   <p>Entering the living-room, Joan put forward the first excuse she
could think of to ensure that her brother might have his coveted few
minutes alone with the girl he loved.
   <p><quote>Mr. Hepworth &mdash; I mean Robert &mdash; I wonder if you'd mind coming
upstairs to look at a damp patch we've got. I thought &mdash; while you're
here...</quote>
   <p>He rose at once, but she saw the surprise he could not altogether
hide. Although technically the owner, his father's old bailiff
performed all that was necessary from a landlord.
   <p>He followed Joan up to the next floor, without comment.
Meanwhile, she was racking her brains for a means of delaying him,
and, at the same time, was wondering where to take him. There were
three bedrooms, Bertie's, the one where she slept and which had
formerly belonged to Uncle Greg, and a tiny spare room, kept sacred
for the infrequent visitor. Avoiding all these, she led him up the
remaining few stairs to the loft, flicking on lights as she went.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry to take you away from the fire.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm not a hot-house plant, I shan't wither. Where's the damp
you mentioned?</quote>
   <p>Joan glanced wildly about her. There was an old couch whose
upholstery needed repairing, two tin trunks, a large lithograph of
Canterbury Cathedral in a hideous frame and some cardboard boxes. The
walls were white-washed and the ceiling innocent of any stain.
   <p>Blushing scarlet, she stammered: <quote>There isn't any d-damp.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then why the blazes did you say there was?</quote>
   <p><quote>I &mdash; I just wanted &mdash; people sometimes like to be alone
together &mdash; please try to understand.</quote>
   <p>Raising her eyes to his, she saw that he was looking at her with
an expression of contempt.
   <p><quote>I believe I do understand,</quote> he said. <quote>Well, if you really
want it, you can have it.</quote>
   <p>Before she realised what he meant, he caught her by the
shoulders, drawing her towards him. She had an instant's glimpse of
grey eyes, hard as steel, then his lips were on hers.
   <p>For one fleeting second, her senses reeled and a sweet thrill ran
through every nerve. Then she had wrenched herself free, her cheeks
burning, her eyes bright with unshed angry tears.
   <p><quote>How dare you!</quote> she gasped.
   <p><quote>Very easily. You've never taken your eyes off me the whole
afternoon, yesterday you managed to fling yourself into my arms &mdash; I
thought it was an accident at the time, I admit, but in face of this,
I'm not so sure.</quote>
   <p><quote>You conceited idiot!</quote> exclaimed Joan, furiously.
   <p><quote>No, I don't flatter myself it's my superior charms which turned
your head. I can imagine how bored you must get here, but you
shouldn't play with fire, you might get the wrong man.</quote>
   <p><quote>I have,</quote> she retorted. <quote>I don't know anyone who could have
behaved so abominably. It was an accident yesterday, I fell over
my shopping bag.</quote>
   <p><quote>At the very moment when I happened to be there to catch you. I
suppose you'll tell me next that staring at me all afternoon was
merely the natural anxiety of a hostess waiting to pour out the second
cup of tea.</quote> Robert was speaking as unkindly as he could, driven to
it by a frightful suspicion that he had made an unforgivable mistake.
<quote>If you're so innocent,</quote> he went on, <quote>show me the damp patch on
the wall &mdash; or would you prefer me to search the ceiling?</quote>
   <p>Joan positively stamped her foot with rage. <quote>There isn't a damp
patch. It was an excuse to get you out of the room.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ah, now we're getting at the truth,</quote> he interposed,
sarcastically.
   <p><quote>Will you listen to me and stop interrupting! The reason
why I wanted to take you away from the others is that my brother's in
love with Lois. He never gets a chance of being alone with her and I
thought &mdash; oh, never mind, you'd never understand. Think what you like
of me. Why should I care? You're only a stranger. Besides, I've
done what I wanted to. They are alone together.</quote>
   <p>She spoke with an air of triumph which had very little to do with
her true feelings. For one dreadful moment she had longed to slap his
face, just as hard as she possibly could. Now, all she wanted was to
drop on to the beastly old broken couch in the corner and sob her
heart out.
   <p>Robert spoke apologetically.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry. I've made an appalling mistake, I see that now.</quote>
   <p><quote>Sorry!</quote> she repeated, derisively.

<text id=LOBP15>
   <p>We were on a stretch of straight road, climbing up towards the
Heights, and he risked taking his eyes from the road for a second to
look fully at me. I couldn't read anything from his face. Apart from
a certain gravity there was nothing in it but the impersonal scrutiny
that belonged to his vocation. He let another car overtake him before
he spoke.
   <p><quote>Still speaking from a professional point of view,</quote> he said,
<quote>I would strongly advise you to pay a visit to your doctor in the
very near future.</quote>
   <p>I didn't answer him until we had reached the row of cottages that
nestled in a hollow underneath the final ascent to the Heights. He
drew the car to a stop on the green in front of the last one in the
row and was in the act of getting out when I said quietly, <quote>You're a
doctor.</quote>
   <p>He reached over into the back and lifted out his bag.
   <p><quote>But not yours, Mrs. Landry. I attend only to the lower
members of your household.</quote>
   <p>He said it quite without rancour, and I was positive none was
intended. <quote>But you could be mine,</quote> I insisted.
   <p>He inclined his head. <quote>I could, yes. But I would advise you to
see your own man, one who knows and understands you.</quote> He shut the
door and leaned down through the window to ask, <quote>Are you coming in,
Mrs. Landry?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote> I shook my head. <quote>No &mdash; I'd rather not.</quote>
   <p><quote>As you wish. I may be a little while in here. You've time to
climb up to the Heights if you feel like it. The view is well worth
the scramble if you haven't seen it before.</quote>
   <p>I waited until he had disappeared into the cottage before I got
out and started up the path that wound its way up behind the row of
houses. I had been there before and I wasn't particularly interested
in the view. It was the old restlessness that drove me on once I
found myself alone, away from the calming influence of his presence.
   <p>I was panting by the time I got to the top and sank on to a small
outcrop of rock. I got my cigarette case out with a certain amount of
defiance and watched the blue smoke drift lazily away on the still
air.
   <p>The view was a magnificent one even in the distant haze of the
November morning. The sun caught and sparkled on the river as it
wound its leisurely way far below. Bare of leaves, the wooded
hillside had a stark beauty, and the fields still held practically the
fresh greenness of midsummer.
   <p>I was sitting there, lost to time, when I heard the foot-steps
behind me and turned to see Dr. Broderick clambering over the uneven
ground. I jumped up in quick remorse.
   <p><quote>Oh, I'm sorry &mdash; I've kept you waiting,</quote> I said hurriedly, but
he waved me back on to my rock.
   <p><quote>There's no hurry,</quote> he said. <quote>I guessed you'd be up here. I
often come up myself when I'm out this way.</quote>
   <p>He sank on to the rock next to me. I noticed that he was not in
the least exerted by the rather stiff climb. His breath came evenly.
   <p>And, strangely, I felt a return of that calmness. I sat there
quietly with him, waiting. I had the feeling that he was waiting,
too &mdash; serenely patient.
   <p>But it was a long time before I spoke. He hadn't invited my
confidence &mdash; rather he seemed to have gone out of his way, a little
earlier, to reject it. He might not like me but I felt that he would
listen, and that he would have an understanding I could never expect
from Charles.
   <p>And so I said at last, <quote>I think I'm losing my reason, Dr.
Broderick.</quote>
   <p>He gave me no more than a casual glance.
   <p><quote>And what makes you think that?</quote> he asked calmly. <quote>As a
rule, a person who is becoming mentally unhinged is the very last to
suspect anything is wrong.</quote>
   <p><quote>But I can't remember who I am,</quote> I said, wretchedly. <quote>I know
that I must be Lisa Landry, and that Charles is my husband and Joanna
my daughter &mdash; but I don't know them. I don't know anyone with whom I
come in contact &mdash; the servants, our neighbours &mdash; I didn't know you
the other day &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Just a minute, Mrs. Landry,</quote> he broke in gently. <quote>Loss of
memory is a very common occurrence. There are many factors that can
contribute to its cause. You mustn't worry that you're losing your
reason because you're suffering from a temporary amnesia &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>But it's more than that. Don't you see? I have a memory &mdash;
but it isn't the right one.</quote>
   <p><quote>What do you mean by that?</quote>
   <p>I asked him then the question I had wanted to ask the vicar, that
man of God. The question I had been too afraid to ask myself in the
darkness of the unsleeping night.
   <p>I asked it unflinchingly, out of the stillness which had
descended suddenly upon us.
   <p><quote>Do you believe, Dr. Broderick, that the soul of a girl who
has been dead nearly sixteen years could inhabit and take possession
of a complete stranger?</quote>
<head>7</head>
   <p>THERE was a bird singing in a tree near at hand. I couldn't
see it but the high, sweet notes of its song held a plaintive,
appealing sadness. The faint whirring of some distant machinery
reached us clearly, a dull monotonous sound. When Dr. Broderick
moved his foot suddenly I jumped nervously.
   <p>He had sat quietly, not looking at me, his face quite inscrutable
so that I had no means of knowing what he was thinking. When he spoke
at last he sounded oddly helpless in his hesitation.
   <p><quote>My dear girl &mdash; I don't profess to know anything about the
spiritual body &mdash; only the physical one. A clergyman would be better
equipped than I am to answer such a question. But tell me why you ask
it?</quote>
   <p>I took a deep breath and faced him fully.
   <p><quote>Because that's what I think has happened to me. If it hasn't &mdash;
then I know I am mad.</quote> I gave a little mirthless laugh. <quote>Take
your choice, Dr. Broderick, which would you rather be if you were
me &mdash; possessed or insane?</quote>
   <p><quote>What makes you think you are either?</quote>
   <p><quote>There's nothing else I can think &mdash; when the only life I know is
that of a girl who has been dead more than fifteen years.</quote>
   <p>I took the cigarette he offered, drawing at it raggedly. I gave
him a quick, nervous glance but he wasn't looking at me. He was
gazing out across the wooded stretch beneath us. I knew that he was
waiting for me to go on but wouldn't hurry me, that his calmness
didn't mean that he was disinterested.
   <p>I started to tell him about Dorcas Mallory. I began with abrupt,
sometimes not quite coherent sentences, but presently beneath the
soothing influence of his quiet attention I went on more fluently.
   <p>I told him about her adoption when she was a child &mdash; no more than
three years old &mdash; so that there was no memory of a previous life
before that with the Mallorys. There was only a vague recollection,
too, of the new mother who had died not much more than a year later.
But the memory of the life with Adrian Mallory was clear. I told him
of her childhood in the house, High Towers &mdash; a lonely childhood,
perhaps, but a happy one, with dear old Henrietta and the kindly
Mrs. Bakewell. I told him of small, uninteresting incidents that
only Dorcas Mallory could have known; those trivial, everyday
occurrences that mean nothing to anyone other than the person they
happened to. I evoked memories of old Henrietta who probably hadn't
been as old as she seemed at that time to the young Dorcas &mdash; of her
warm motherliness and her fragrance of lavender; of Adrian Mallory,
his shyness and his gentle kindness, and as I talked about him I think
I realized for the first time that I would never see him again &mdash; that
perhaps I had never known him, for how could I have done so? I know
that I talked of him with a sadness that went deep inside me.
   <p>I recalled Dorcas Mallory's schooldays &mdash; rather lonely schooldays
with not many close friends because the reserve that was in Adrian
Mallory was in Dorcas, too. But she had not particularly felt the
loneliness and the holidays had been happy ones &mdash; spent mostly at
home, at first because of her father's reluctance to travel and then
because the war made travelling impracticable.
   <p>When I told him about Russ I found it difficult to speak
impersonally. There was so much that I couldn't put into words, not
even to someone as understanding as Dr. Broderick. How could I
possibly describe to anyone the love between Russell Winslow and
Dorcas Mallory? My voice broke when I finally told him of the wedding
that never took place, of the journey to London of Dorcas and Adrian
Mallory, of the happiness of that girl on the eve of her marriage.
   <p>I sat silent at last, my head bent, watching the slight breeze
lazily stirring a curled brown leaf at my feet. It rustled faintly as
it moved, and then a sharper breath of wind caught it and hurried it
away.
   <p>Dr. Broderick said gently, <quote>What then?</quote>
   <p>I looked up, somehow startled that he had been unable to follow
the wistful trend of my mind. <quote>What then?</quote> I repeated, and then,
keeping my voice as steady and expressionless as I could, <quote>Dorcas
and her father were killed in an air raid. There was no wedding.
They both died that night.</quote>
   <p><quote>This girl you have been telling me about &mdash; she is the
one...?</quote> He paused uncertainly. I think his logical mind found it
difficult to put my fantastic supposition into words. I waited to see
if he would continue.
   <p>When he didn't, I said, <quote>I woke up on the day of Joanna's
wedding thinking that it was my wedding day. I didn't know where
I was, or why, but the events I have been telling you about &mdash; that
evening in London &mdash; were so clear to me that I thought it was still
April, 1944. I took up Dorcas Mallory's life exactly at the point
where she died.</quote> He stirred slightly as though he would have
interrupted but I went on, <quote>I can't tell you a single thing about
Lisa Landry's life prior to that morning in August, but I can tell you
all about Dorcas Mallory. I can tell you of these things that no
one &mdash; not even Charles &mdash; could have told me. I am Lisa Landry &mdash; but
my mind is Dorcas Mallory.</quote>
   <p>He said, <quote>Charles &mdash; your husband?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why do you say &mdash; that even Charles could not have told you?
How could he know anything at all &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Charles and Adrian Mallory were stepbrothers,</quote> I said. <quote>I &mdash;
Dorcas never saw him until a few weeks before &mdash; before she died. He
spent most of his time in Canada.</quote>
   <p><quote>Did you know this girl?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p><quote>But you probably heard your husband talk about her?</quote>
   <p><quote>He never really knew her.</quote> I said it defensively, but
against what I wasn't quite sure. <quote>I told you &mdash; Dorcas never met him
until a few weeks before she was killed. And then she barely knew
him &mdash; they only met a very few times. Charles couldn't possibly know
all the things I have told you about her.</quote>
   <p><quote>He could know a good deal of it,</quote> he said gently. <quote>And some
of the things... Are you quite sure that you know these things,
or could you have imagined them?</quote>
   <p><quote>No!</quote> I said it with a sense of outrage. <quote>No one could
possibly imagine everything I know about Dorcas Mallory &mdash; every
detail of her life &mdash; every incident, day by day. And Russ...</quote>
   <p><quote>The man Dorcas was to marry?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes &mdash; I knew him immediately I saw him. How could I have
recognized a man I have never met?</quote>

<text id=LOBP16>
Yes, he would see Mackinnon and see if he could get anything out of
him. For Jane's sake he would have to know. So that this could be
stopped before it was too late &mdash; if it was not too late already. To
his surprise he found himself hoping that there was nothing dreadful
to discover. For Jane's sake, of course. She would be hurt. And he
did not want her hurt. And young Grant &mdash; damn it, he had almost liked
him the other night. And he could not help admiring him, for his guts
in tackling the job he was tackling.
   <p>But Alison, who, after all had brought up four daughters, seemed
to think it would all fade out. And Elizabeth had some plans...
   <p><quote>You'll be starting counting days to your holiday soon, Jane,</quote>
he said cheerfully.
   <p>Jane smiled but did not answer. If she counted days it would be
for a reason contrary to what the General thought. She gave him half
her attention as he went on talking about what Elizabeth had said in
her last letter, conjecturing about when they would see Susan again.
She was thinking of how she would tell Neil what her father had said
about his parents, seeing the look of relief which would come into his
dark eyes when he knew his aunt's disparaging remarks had had no
foundation in fact. How glad she was that Neil could now look back to
his young parents with affection, untouched by fear. How glad she was
that they had decided to recreate that flower garden which Angus
seemed to think had been created by Neil's mother.
   <p><quote>Father, I'm going to ask you for a heap of cuttings in the
autumn. There's a wide strip of land at Dalnadoire which Angus says
was once a garden. So we &mdash;</quote> she coloured and changed it, <quote>so Neil
is going to start it again. I've said we'd give him lots of
plants.</quote>
   <p><quote>Plants! Plenty of those, Jane.</quote> Here the General was in his
element. <quote>Come out when you've finished, and we'll mark what you
want. Best to do that when they're flowering.</quote> He got up stiffly
out of his chair. <quote>There's that new delphinium I put in last autumn.
Coming out now. Grand colour. You'd like it in the background,
Jane. And it's growing so well that it will split. Come out and look
at it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. I'll just get rid of these.</quote> She got up from the
table, stacking dishes, and smiled to herself as she ran between the
dining-room and the kitchen. Once they got to know Neil they would be
sure to like him. She would just need to have patience.
   <p>The next three weeks went by with what seemed to be an
astonishing rapidity. Jane had had little enthusiasm for her holiday
at the beginning, but now she had even less. To have to exchange,
even for a fortnight, the warm happiness of being with Neil, of
sharing with him their growing love, of watching how everything was
progressing at the farm she was coming to love as much as he did, for
Elizabeth and her lectures, for spells of baby-sitting, and keeping at
arm's length the rather callow young men whom Elizabeth seemed to
know, was far from pleasing. But she could see no way to get out of
it. Her mother was constantly talking of it, enlarging on the
supposed pleasures in store, expecting from her an enthusiasm which
Jane could not produce.
   <p>That Lady Rose was thinking more of getting Jane away from
Drumlairig than of her having an enjoyable holiday, Jane was well
aware. General Rose might be starting to think more kindly of Neil,
be beginning to take an interest in him and his doings, to see in him
something to admire, but her mother was not. To her Neil Grant was
still someone of so little account that he could be completely
ignored. It almost seemed that she was completely unaware of her
daughter's friendship with him.
   <p>But, despite that, for Jane those weeks were happy ones. Neil
was still working hard, indeed seemed to be working even harder.
There was so much to be done and everything had to be done in a
manner conforming to the high standard he had set himself. Dalnadoire
was beginning to look like a well-kept, prosperous farm, the old house
was being gradually cleaned and painted.
   <p>Jane watched progress with eager, loving eyes, was there to give
praise and encouragement.
   <p>The weather was fine, the days were hot, but one morning Jane,
rising early as usual, looked out of her window to see that the trees
and the chimneys were almost blotted out by mist. There was not a
mountain to be seen and there was a stillness over everything. Was
this the first sign that autumn was coming? Surely it was still too
early in the year for that, but everything was early this year. But
whatever it was it was a disagreeable morning, and she would need to
get away quickly for it would take her much longer to walk that mile
to the station with visibility a mere ten yards.
   <p>Shrouded in a mackintosh, shivering a little in the damp still
air, she hurried down the drive. It felt as if she were alone in the
world. Apart from the never ceasing swishing and pounding of the
river, there was not a movement, not a sound. And then a dog barked,
another joined in excitedly, and two small forms ran eagerly towards
her.
   <p><quote>Why Rory! Gill! What are you doing here?</quote> she exclaimed and
looked beyond them, as a man's figure loomed out of the mist.
   <p><quote>Morning, Jane,</quote> Neil was greeting her cheerfully. <quote>Want a
lift?</quote> He put an arm about her shoulders, smiling at her surprised
face. <quote>Not the sort of morning for a walk. Here's the car.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why, Neil! I never expected to see you. Are you going to the
station?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote> He had the door of the car opened. <quote>In you get.</quote>
   <p>She got in, the puppies scrambled in after her and she let them
jump eagerly on to her lap as Neil went round to the driver's seat.
   <p><quote>Have you something to collect, Neil?</quote>
   <p>He shook his head as he started the engine and they moved off.
<quote>I want to see you get safely there,</quote> he said quietly.
   <p><quote>You mean &mdash; you've come especially to take me?</quote>
   <p>He smiled. <quote>You don't think I was going to have you walking
that lonely road on a morning like this?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, Neil!</quote> she murmured and felt wonderful. And when in a
few minutes they reached the station, she leaned over, put her hands
on his shoulders and kissed him on the mouth, not caring at all that a
smiling Willie MacIntyre was an interested spectator.
   <p>There were many other small incidents to show Jane what she was
to Neil, to make her feel warm and rich and essential. On the
Tuesdays when she met him in Inverness for lunch, they usually managed
to have a little time left after their meal was over. At first they
had walked along the river to the islands, or climbed the hill to the
castle, looking at the statue of Flora MacDonald, at the view westward
at which she gazed. But latterly they had spent their time among the
shops. Window shopping, Jane said. Nor did they restrict their
window gazing to the books which delighted them both.
   <p>It was the week before Jane was due to go on holiday that they
saw the chest of drawers. It was small, in a beautifully veined
walnut, and its bow front gave it an elegance which pleased them both.
They agreed that it was the sort of thing they liked, they looked at
it from all angles, discovered its price and then Neil said quietly,
<quote>Shall we buy it, Jane?</quote>
   <p><quote>Buy it?</quote> She looked at him quickly, her colour heightened.
   <p>He was not looking at her and there was some colour too in his
tanned face. <quote>I mean, when we see it &mdash; Dalnadoire needs a lot of
furniture and &mdash; later we might not see one we like as well as this
one.</quote>
   <p>Jane smiled. <quote>Could we, Neil?</quote> she asked.
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>Let's buy it then,</quote> she said in a matter-of-fact tone. <quote>I
can just see it against that short wall beyond the window, in what
will be the lounge.</quote>
   <p>He turned to her, smiling now. <quote>Have you time, Jane?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh yes,</quote> Jane said happily.
   <p>So on the Sunday Jane found a new task. With a soft duster she
had to carefully polish the lovely walnut chest. Neil watched her
young, earnest face lovingly, but with the shadow in his dark eyes
which was often there when his face was in repose and when he was
watching Jane. Later he took her off for a walk on to the moors.
   <p>The day was hot and in the early morning there had been a
suspicion of thunder, but the clouds had passed, although there was
still a heaviness in the air.
   <p>When they reached the second stile, Jane perched on the top of
it, and they looked back down the slope.
   <p><quote>A storm, if it isn't too wild, wouldn't do any harm,</quote> Neil
commented. <quote>The river is running much slower than usual.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. Did you bathe in that pool above the falls when you were
a boy, Neil?</quote> she asked.
   <p>He grinned as he turned to look at her, leaning against her
knees. <quote>I did. Every morning before anyone else was astir I'd run
out and have ten glorious, splashing minutes, before I dashed back
again, pretending I'd never left the house.</quote>
   <p><quote>Did Mrs. Cummings object to you bathing?</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't know about the bathing, but she didn't want her house
messed up. Though one morning she did catch me, and I was the usual
lazy ingrate and so on and so on. I decided then, Jane,</quote> there was
a twinkle in his eyes as he went on, <quote>that my family &mdash; for some
unknown reason I seemed to think I was going to have several children
and that we'd be living at Dalnadoire &mdash; would be allowed to play in
that pool whenever they liked.</quote>
   <p>There was an answering twinkle in her blue eyes. <quote>Are you still
of the same opinion, Neil?</quote>
   <p>His smile widened. <quote>I am. But their mother would have to
approve. She mightn't think it a good idea.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm sure,</quote> Jane said carefully, <quote>that any girl you'd made
the mother of your children, would be quite sensible about that sort
of thing. She'd want them to have fun.</quote>
   <p>Neil laid his cheek against the back of her hand, which she had
resting lightly on his shoulder, for a moment. <quote>I think Dalnadoire
is a house which needs a family of children,</quote> he said quietly.
   <p><quote>It does,</quote> Jane agreed. <quote>It should be filled with fun and
laughter. Neil,</quote> she went on seriously, <quote>you never told me what
made you run away just at that time, after all those miserable years.
Was it because you were unhappy, a sort of cumulative unhappiness?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well,</quote> he answered slowly, <quote>I didn't run &mdash; I walked. All
the way from here to Aberdeen. Unhappy? I suppose that came into it.
But the main, the overwhelming reason, was pride.</quote>
   <p><quote>Pride?</quote> Jane repeated in surprise.
   <p><quote>Pride,</quote> he said again. <quote>To be told, day after day for all
those years, that you were living on charity, that there was no reason
why they should have to work their fingers to the bone to keep an
ungrateful cur like you were &mdash; I was determined that as soon as I
could I was going to go somewhere where she hadn't to keep me. And
what was more I was going to repay her all she'd had to spend on
me.</quote>
   <p><quote>But, Neil,</quote> Jane was red with indignation, <quote>you weren't
living on charity. It was yours.</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't know. And she said I was. I planned it carefully,
Jane.
<QUOTE>

<text id=LOBP17>
   <p><quote>June, do you mean that?</quote> he exclaimed.
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> she returned and her steady gaze conveyed as much as
the brief reply.
   <p>He caught his breath and swung back to his own seat. He started
the car, and sped on at a speed that gradually filled her with alarm.
   <p><quote>Where are we going? You must turn back!</quote> she cried, as a
milestone flashed by.
   <p><quote>We'll go where there can be no turning back,</quote> he replied.
<quote>We'll drive till midnight, and stay at the first place we come to.
Then neither of us can ever go back, and the matter will be
settled.</quote>
   <p><quote>Eustace!</quote> She caught hold of his arm. <quote>You're mad! Turn
back!</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he muttered. <quote>Other people give up everything for
love, and why not we? Love may not be all, but at least it's more
than all the rest. I can't give you up, June. I won't.</quote>
   <p>That his reckless impulse was due as much to pride and anger, the
chagrin of an imperious man thwarted, as to any warmer passion, made
it easier for her to recall him, his own natural good sense and
worship of the conventions coming to her aid, but June had her hands
over his, trying to force him to turn the car, which performed some
queer antics during the brief struggle, and she was imploring him,
half sobbing, before she succeeded in persuading him to bring the car
to a standstill.
   <p><quote>Oh, turn round and drive back at once,</quote> she cried, sobbing
openly now the danger was past. <quote>How could you be so mad?</quote>
   <p>He allowed her to shed agitated tears for some moments, without
offering a word of apology, his mouth compressed, his features cruel
in their clear-cut rigidity.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry,</quote> he said then. <quote>And nothing will make you alter
your decision?</quote>
   <p><quote>Please don't talk about it any more. Drive home.</quote>
   <p><quote>You think you'll make him happy by marrying him out of pity?</quote>
he asked.
   <p><quote>It isn't pity. I'm fond of him. I was glad when he asked me
to be his wife, and if &mdash; if meeting you earlier might have made a
difference, it can't do now. It would be mean to throw him aside,
just to suit my convenience.</quote>
   <p><quote>If he were well &mdash;</quote> began Hilton.
   <p><quote>I'd act exactly the same,</quote> she broke in. <quote>Please drive
back. It's quite dark.</quote>
   <p>Hilton gave a sigh of fierce protest, and in another minute they
were rushing back along the way they had come.
   <p>
   <p>AFTER a temporary improvement, Frank Elvington's health
ceased to show any advance. Even his own optimism became slightly
dimmed. Whilst still confident of his recovery, he did not talk of it
and his marriage with such eagerness as before, obviously regarding
both as some distance away.
   <p>June watched him with an ache in her heart. She seldom saw
Hilton, both she and he avoiding each other as much as possible, and
she devoted herself to Frank, trying to put Hilton out of her mind.
   <p>One day, when she found Frank preoccupied, he confessed that he
had been strongly advised to leave England, and had refused, at any
rate, for the present.
   <p><quote>But why not go, dear?</quote> she urged. <quote>You must do anything to
get better.</quote>
   <p><quote>Because I don't want to leave you,</quote> he confessed.
   <p><quote>You mustn't hesitate to go anywhere where there's the least
chance of hastening your recovery.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh &mdash; well,</quote> he said reluctantly. <quote>I've promised to think of
it.</quote>
   <p>Whilst he hesitated, June met Dr. Rother, who told her that
Frank's only chance of life was to sail immediately for South Africa.
He and Dr. Hilton, he added, had done wonders in keeping him alive
as long as they had done, but nothing more could be done for him in
England. The warm climate of South Africa was his last and only
chance.
   <p>June had not thought his danger so great, and hearing that Dr.
Hilton was still with him, she hastened to Cliff Top, and was in time
to stop Hilton as he crossed the wide entrance-hall to the door.
   <p>He was passing her with an inclination of his head.
   <p><quote>No,</quote> she said, unsteadily. <quote>I must speak to you, please!</quote>
   <p>He followed her into the room near by.
   <p><quote>Dr. Rother says that Frank must go away at once,</quote> she said.
   <p><quote>He has just consented to do so,</quote> replied Hilton.
   <p><quote>But is it true that this is his last chance?</quote> she asked, and
when he averted his head, not answering, <quote>Doctor Rother says it's
his only chance,</quote> she added distressfully.
   <p>He turned his head sharply looking down at her with a ruthless
directness, and his words fell with icy distinctness.
   <p><quote>It is not his only chance,</quote> he said. <quote>It is no chance at
all.</quote>
   <p>June turned white, her lips falling apart, speechless.
   <p><quote>He may never come back,</quote> announced Hilton deliberately.
   <p>She was horrified. For all her fears, it came as a shock to hear
Frank's doom pronounced in so many words. She looked out of the
window to where the leaves were already turning to pale yellow and
deep copper, a mellow sky above them and she thought of all the
beautiful things awaiting his enjoyment, of all the many years of life
he was to miss.
   <p><quote>Are you sure?</quote> she whispered.
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>He doesn't know?</quote> she faltered, and professional instinct
brought his brows together.
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he said, <quote>and you must not allow him to guess. I have
told you he may never come back, but that must not be repeated to him.
A patient's optimism has performed miracles before now.</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course, he must not be robbed of hope. But you don't expect
any miracle to happen?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p>There was a little pause, whilst June mourned. Remembering
Frank's unwillingness to be separated from her &mdash;
   <p><quote>Then is it any use sending him away to &mdash; to die among
strangers?</quote> she asked. <quote>He doesn't want to go.</quote>
   <p><quote>He must go,</quote> replied Hilton. <quote>However useless, we must
insist upon everything being done which possibly can be done.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, of course,</quote> she assented, sadly.
   <p><quote>You see, June,</quote> said Hilton, softly, <quote>you cannot put another
man in my place even if you wish.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't talk of that,</quote> she begged. <quote>How long &mdash; how long do
you expect?</quote>
   <p><quote>It may be as long as seven or eight months, but you'll be
married to me before that, June.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, no!</quote> Even his attraction was powerless to affect her at
that moment. <quote>How can you mention such a thing?</quote>
   <p><quote>Our marriage won't hasten his end by so much as a second, for
he need not know of it,</quote> remarked Hilton, <quote>and I cannot pretend to
love you less, now I know you're going to be mine.</quote>
   <p>He stepped to the door and opened it for her to pass out. She
could not answer. She knew it was only natural that he should not be
deeply affected by Frank's death, and equally natural that he should
be pleased at the possibility of making her his wife, yet there seemed
something callous about his calmness.
   <p>She braced herself up to face Frank, but the ordeal was far worse
than she had expected, for she found him in quite good spirits,
waiting eagerly to tell her the news.
   <p><quote>June, darling, I'm going to South Africa,</quote> he announced.
<quote>I've just promised Hilton. He says I haven't a chance here, but
he's certain that a year out there will make me as well as ever I've
been. He's told me of another case similar to mine, which he sent out
there with excellent results. I didn't tell you, darling, but I
hadn't much faith in the idea before. I thought I'd perhaps go away
from you and &mdash; all to no purpose, and if I wasn't going to get better
I wanted to stay with you. But now I feel satisfied it's just a
year's absence and then &mdash; oh, June! &mdash; health and you! No price is too
great for that!</quote>
   <p>It took all her courage and self-control to hide her tragic
knowledge from him and to respond to his cheerful talk. She tried to
rememeber what Hilton had said of the miracles performed by optimism
and the desire for life, and to will passionately that Frank's belief
in his recovery would add another miracle to the annals of the sick.
   <p><quote>But oh, June, to leave you all that time!</quote> he exclaimed.
<quote>Eight or nine months at the very least, he said, and most probably
a year. Will you forget me in all that time?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, Frank, I'll be marking the days off on the calendar and
waiting for your return,</quote> she said, though she choked over the
words.
   <p>He pressed her fingers to his lips, afterwards holding her hand
close against his cheek.
   <p><quote>I'd rather stay here and die, with you beside me to the end,</quote>
he whispered, <quote>than go away for all that long dreary time and then
not return to you after all. Supposing something happens to part us,
June?</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothing will,</quote> she declared, with the tears running down her
cheeks, her hands holding him protectingly. <quote>Because do you know
why, Frank? Because we're not going to be parted.</quote>
   <p>She spoke vehemently in the impulse that had come to her, the
passionate desire to comfort and serve, to sweeten his tragedy.
   <p><quote>I'm going with you,</quote> she announced, firmly.
   <p><quote>June, darling!</quote> He raised himself, his face irradiated.
<quote>Do you really mean you'll marry me before I go?</quote>
   <p>She nodded, a smile quivering under her tears, and as he clasped
her to him, kissing and thanking her, she had no regret for her
impulse of pity, only a great thankfulness that she could at least
make his last months happy.
   <p><quote>Sweetheart, I'll ask so little of you,</quote> he whispered, when
his first rush of gratitude was over. <quote>I only want to have you with
me. You're not going to marry a miserable invalid. We'll have a real
honeymoon when I'm well. It will be something to get well for. Until
that time you'll be Mrs. Elvington only to other people. To me
you'll still be my beautiful sweetheart who's waiting for me. And oh,
darling, you won't have to wait long! I'll make such haste to get
well.</quote>
   <p>Every moment she remained with him increased her satisfaction
with the step she had taken, and when she left him she felt more at
peace than she had done since Eustace Hilton had come into her life.
   <p>She had undertaken a definite service, one that both her head and
her heart approved, and which left no room for personal
considerations.
   <p>Thus it was that when Hilton called that evening, she was beyond
his power to influence.
   <p>She was in her room, making out a list of the many things she
required to take with her out of England, when his car stopped at the
gate. Thinking it must be Frank who had sent for her, she leaned out
of the window, alarmed when she recognised the car, fearing he had
brought her ill news of Frank.
   <p>She did not imagine that he would pay her a visit except in
Frank's interest, and when she hurried into the room where her mother
was trying in vain to learn the reason of his visit, her first words
were of her fiancee .
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he replied, <quote>there is nothing to be anxious about, but
I shall be obliged if you can give me a few moments alone.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Arnage rose somewhat haughtily, taking her departure with
distinct displeasure. She might have borne much for Dr. Hilton
once, but as mother of the so soon-to-be Mrs. Frank Elvington, of
Cliff Top, she resented his cool dismissal.
   <p><quote>What is it?</quote> asked June, when she was alone with Hilton. She
could not think what had brought him.
   <p><quote>Elvington telephoned me to announce your immediate marriage,</quote>
he replied, through his teeth, it seemed, his tightened lips moved so
little.
   <p><quote>Oh!</quote>
   <p>June was simultaneously relieved and troubled. Relieved that his
call meant no fresh ill to Frank, distressed and perturbed that he
should be going to reopen personal matters which now more than ever
should be buried and forgotten.

<head>The Birds</head>
<head>A short story by Barbara Comyns</head>
   <p>Little Hal was like a boy made of butter &mdash; yellow complexion
and yellow hair. After his mother's death, his thin little face
contorted into sudden grimaces. His younger brother Charlie held up
his chubby arms with love towards Cousin Nelly, who kept house for
their father now he no longer had a wife; but Hal would sit behind the
shed door, grimacing under his large straw hat, his long yellow
fingers twisting the tags at the back of his boots.
   <p><squote>That boy's highly strung,</squote> Nelly would say to his father.
<squote>He don't seem natural. Why don't you get him a pet, Bert &mdash; a
kitten or a dog?</squote>
   <p><squote>He'll be all right when he goes to school,</squote> Bert would
answer, and he would give the robust Charlie a poke with his
earth-grimed forefinger, which caused the little boy to roll about
with laughter, then disappear under the green serge tablecloth until
Bert prodded him again and there would be more laughter.
   <p><squote>There's a boy for you,</squote> Bert would proclaim with pride, and
Hal's unnatural behaviour would be forgotten.
   <p>
   <p>Hal was not all right when he went to school. He was afraid
of the other children and was sick in the Plasticine box on the first
day. He refused to speak a word, and kept leaving his desk to stand
by the door and make faces. The following day he behaved in the same
way, except that he wasn't sick. As he stood by the door, a sinister
wet patch appeared round his feet and the children shouted, <squote>Please,
teacher, that there Hal has wet himself.</squote> The teacher, very red in
the face, gave Hal a smack on the hand with a ruler, and put some of
the sawdust that the chalks had been packed in on the wet patch. Hal
did not cry, but the rims of his eyes became red as though he had, and
he sat quite still for the rest of the morning just watching the door.
   <p>When Nelly came to fetch him home the teacher said, <squote>That Hal
of yours lives in a world of his own. He doesn't seem to be all
there.</squote> Nelly looked rather put out and replied that he was quite
all right, only the poor little chap was highly strung. <squote>His dad's
going to get him a pet. He'll be all right then, you'll see.</squote>
   <p>When Bert came home for his dinner she said, <squote>What about that
little cat or dog you were going to bring home for Hal, to give him an
interest in things. The boy wet himself at school today. It don't
seem natural at his age.</squote>
   <p>Hal's eyes became red rimmed again, but he did not speak. He
seldom did. His father said, <squote>Well, I've got him a little bird, but
I must buy a cage first. You'd like a nice green bird, wouldn't you,
Hal?</squote> The boy just nodded his head, but Charlie said, <squote>Charlie
wants a green bird too. Will it lay green eggs?</squote> and Nelly picked
him up and, hugging him, said he was a caution.
   <p>
   <p>The next day, when Hal returned from school, there was the
bird in a wooden cage with bars in front. His father showed him how
the cage should be cleaned and the seed and water containers filled;
and he told him that the bird could be taught to talk <squote>if you speak
to it nice and quiet.</squote>
   <p>Hal put the cage on the table and gazed at the bird, fascinated.
He put his face close and whispered something very softly, then put
his ear close, hoping for a reply. At that moment, Charlie came
running up and put his fingers between the bars, shouting ~<squote>Hallo,
green bird,</squote> and the terrified bird fluttered into a corner of its
cage. Hal turned to his brother and slapped his laughing, pink face.
Nelly jumped to her feet, yelling <squote>You've no call to do that.</squote>
Hal, afraid that his new treasure would be taken away from him,
picked up the cage and dashed from the house to the garden shed, where
he spent the afternoon softly talking to the bird and watching it.
   <p>He became devoted to the bird. He was allowed to keep it in his
bedroom under the eaves, where it was safe from Charlie. Usually,
when he came home from school, he would free the bird from its cage,
and it would fly around the room, picking up little things with its
beak and sometimes settling on Hal's head or hand. He talked to it
and he said it talked to him, but no one knew if this were true
because it flew back to the safety of its cage as soon as anyone else
entered the room.
   <p>The teacher said Hal was doing better at school &mdash; not that he
learnt anything, exactly, but he did sit still and behave better, and
sometimes drew birds in his copy-book. Perhaps he would get around to
letters later, she added.
   <p>
   <p>Then, one afternoon, a fearful thing happened. He was up in
that little room of his, with the bird sitting on his shoulder. He
was talking to it very quietly, and perhaps the bird was talking
back &mdash; no one knew for sure. Outside the door, Charlie was listening
hard because he wanted to hear the bird talk too. Suddenly he burst
the door open and cried, <squote>I heard it, I did.</squote>
   <p>The bird left Hal's shoulder and, afraid, flew across the room,
searching for its cage. Not knowing about reflections, it first flew
straight into the old brown-framed mirror on Hal's chest-of-drawers
and then, in panic, out of the open window and away. Hal knew at once
that his bird had gone and would never come back.
   <p>It was after the bird's disappearance that Hal had his first sort
of fit. He never mentioned the bird again. Perhaps he had even
forgotten all about it, but as he almost never spoke now no one really
knew what he was thinking about. He had taken to sitting behind the
shed door again, and sometimes he could be heard talking to himself.
   <p>It was in September that Bert brought home the two cockerels, one
white, one black. They were leggy young birds, just growing their
wing feathers. The father said to his boys, <squote>There's a bird apiece
for you. I want you to fatten them up, and when they are fit for
eating we'll have a great party and Nelly will become your mother.
Now see which of you can make his bird grow the biggest.</squote>
   <p>Charlie chose the white bird and Hal had to have the black. It
was slightly on the small side, but the difference in size soon
changed and Hal's bird grew and grew. On the way home from school he
gathered corn from the sides of the fields and stuffed it in his
pockets, and as soon as he came in by the gate the cockerel used to
run to meet him. Nelly said, <squote>Well, Hal, I must say your cock is
growing into a fine bird. Little Charlie's can't hold a candle to
it.</squote> Hal gave one of his rare smiles and looked at his bird with
pride. It certainly was almost twice the size of Charlie's.
   <p>The cockerels grew very large, and early in December Bert said,
<squote>Nelly, those birds are ready. We must see about the banns.</squote>
When Hal heard his father say this he knew that one day when he came
home from school his cockerel would not be there to meet him. It
would have to be sacrificed if there was to be a party and Nelly was
to become his mother. He could imagine everyone's surprise when Nelly
began to change. He wondered if she would be wearing mama's blue
dress with the lace on the collar. Perhaps, as it was winter, it
would be the brown one trimmed with braid, in patterns he thought
resembled snail shells.
   <p>
   <p>The days passed and still the glossy black cock waited by the
garden gate for Hal's return from school. Some days he felt he could
not bear it any longer, and he would plan to ask his father to cancel
the party so that his bird would be saved; but this would mean that
Nelly would not turn into his mother, and that would be terrible. The
black cock would have to die. He almost wished it would peck him so
that he need not love it so much. Charlie had given up feeding his
because it had pecked him right across the nose. Nelly had thrown a
stone at it and shouted, <squote>Your days are numbered, you bad old
bird.</squote>
   <p>Then, one afternoon when Hal came home, there was no cock waiting
by the gate, and the knob on the kitchen door had blood and feathers
stuck to it. He went to the back of the shed and was sick. When he
saw Nelly he asked her when it was she was going to turn into his
mama.
   <p><squote>Why, fancy you remembering that, you clever boy! In two days I
will be your mama and cousin too.</squote>
   <p>Hal sat on his stool by the fire and tried to work this out in
his mind. Later, he asked, ~<squote>Will you have two heads?</squote> and Nelly
said, <squote>Bless the boy. Whatever is he thinking about now?</squote>
   <p>
   <p>The day of the wedding came. Hal and Charlie had new blue
shirts and new belts with buckles to fasten them, shaped like snakes.
Nelly had a green velvet dress and a hat with pansies on it. When
Hal asked her why she wasn't wearing his mother's brown dress, she
replied, <squote>Oh, that old thing! Why the moths had it months ago.</squote>
   <p>The cottage became filled with people, and there was a lot of
noisy talk and laughter. Then it was time for the party, and they all
sat down to devour Hal's and Charlie's birds. When Hal could bring
himself to look at the steaming brown carcasses he could see how much
larger his bird was than his brother's, and although he felt a great
sadness there was a feeling of pride as well.
   <p>A man with a large waxed moustache and a mop of curly damp hair,
whom Hal thought might be his uncle Fred, said, <squote>That's a fine bird
you're carving, Bert.</squote> Hal waited, breathless, to hear his father
tell everyone that it was his bird that was so large, but Bert was too
preoccupied with carving to answer. Sweat was pouring down his face,
and he did not like to take his jacket off in company. Later, he
turned to Hal and said, ~<squote>You'd like a little of the breast and
perhaps some stuffing, Hal?</squote> and the boy replied that he would like
to eat some of the smaller bird, please. He could not eat his own; it
was dreadful to see it there all cut about.
   <p>Every now and then he'd look down the table at Nelly, who was
sitting there looking flushed and very pretty, but not in the least
like his mama. The cocks had been killed and were almost eaten now
and the party had been going on a long time, but there was no sign of
his mother's return. Perhaps there was some mistake. The last knife
and fork had ceased to rattle against the plate, and the bottle of
port had been opened. For a moment there was silence; then Hal braced
himself to ask, <squote>Dad, whose bird was the largest, Charlie's or
mine?</squote> Everyone turned towards him in surprise and, with half a
smile on his face, he waited for them to know whose had been that
splendid bird.
   <p>Bert considered for a moment. Then, remembering that Hal had
asked for a slice from the little bird, he answered, <squote>They were both
real fine birds. I was proud to carve them. Yours was very tender
but I think Charlie's was the largest.</squote>

<text id=LOBP19>
   <p>It was one of the strangest courtships I'd ever known &mdash; it held
society gossips by the ears all that Season
<head>A pretty case for Freud</head>
<head>BY ALEC WAUGH</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY BOB PEAKE</head>
   <p>I NOTICED him in the first place because he was the only
other person in the pavilion wearing a silk hat. I had the excuse of
having come on there from a wedding. But I should have gone back and
changed had I known how conspicuous I should be.
   <p>It was ten years since I had been to the Varsity Match at Lord's.
And I was astonished by the change; by the empty stands, the absence
of smart frocks, the lounge-suited atmosphere of the enclosures. A
social occasion, for whose sake in remote rectories mothballs had been
once shaken out of braided coats and wide-brimmed <quote>toppers</quote>
stripped of their tissue wrappings, was now a very ordinary cricket
match in which the general public took little interest.
   <p>As I walked in my sponge-bag trousers and shining hat through the
long, high, many-windowed morning room, I felt as antediluvian as the
curved bats and pastoral portraits that adorn its walls: so
antediluvian that as I took my seat beside the one other Edwardian
survival, a hackneyed Latin tag &mdash; the tongue that it is a solecism now
to quote &mdash; actually seemed appropriate to the occasion.
   <p>I thought of Lord's as the pre-war pages of Punch presented
it; of Lord's as I had known it in the early 'twenties; the
tight-packed mounds; the coaches by the tavern; the parade of parasols
between the innings; colour, excitement, glamour; and now this:
Homburgs and bowler hats in the pavilion, long terraces of white
beside the screen... Nos duo turba sumus, I thought, as I
leant sideways towards my fellow relic.
   <p><quote>I wonder,</quote> I asked, <quote>if I might see your scorecard?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>HE turned; and I immediately forgot that it was a need for
sartorial kinship that had decided my choice of seat.
   <p>He was one of the most striking-looking men that I have ever
seen.
   <p>He was young: in the latish twenties; and handsome in a
clear-skinned way. But it was not merely his good looks that startled
me. The impression that he made is not to be explained by any
cataloguing of separate features; high forehead, grey-blue eyes, full
mouth, long pointed nose. I was no more conscious of those separate
features than one is of the pattern on a transparent lampshade. Just
as there are two kinds of lampshade, the one whose object it is to
retransmit a softened light and the other that is a decoration,
simply; so are there certain types of face, the one in which the
personality is subservient to the featured mask of lip, brow, cheek,
to which it gives mobility and meaning, the other in which you are so
exclusively conscious of the personality behind that mask that you
sometimes find yourself unable to describe the physical appearance of
someone with the very texture of whose thought you are familiar.
   <p>It was like that now. I was conscious not of a handsome face,
but of a new person; of someone who was masterful but unworldly;
practical but inexperienced; masculine but with that look of
anticipation, of waiting to be fulfilled that you expect to find in a
young girl; a combination of characteristics so self-contradictory
that the obvious corollary to their catalogue would be: <quote>What a mass
of complexes. A pretty case for Freud.</quote> That was what you would
have expected.
   <p>He wasn't, though. He was of a piece, without
self-consciousness; the kind of man who does not know what the word
shyness means.
   <p>I was curious, alert, excited. I've got to find out who you are,
I thought.
   <p>In the lazy atmosphere of a cricket match it is easy to start a
conversation. The cricket was slow, desultory, undramatic. In a
little while we were more interested in our talk than in the match.
At any rate, I was.
   <p>His talk had the same contradictory characteristics as his
appearance. It was boyishly eager, yet at the same time
authoritative. It was the talk of one who stood on the brink of
experience, yet was accustomed to the exercise of authority. More
baffling still, though his voice had a slightly mannered intonation,
it had no trace of the drawl that you would expect to find in a
fashionably-dressed young man. He was a puzzle, right enough.
   <p>
   <p>THE hands of the turret clock pointed to five o'clock.
Stumps would not be drawn till half past six. In an hour and a half
I ought to be able to find out something about him.
   <p>Luck came my way.
   <p>An exchange of ideas became an argument, a point which could only
be settled by the consultation of a particular book of reference. I
had fancied the book was in the pavilion library. It did not prove to
be; or anyhow, we could not find it. I happened to have a copy at my
flat.
   <p><quote>It's not five minutes' walk away,</quote> I said. <quote>Let's go back
there afterwards and have a sherry.</quote>
   <p><quote>Let's go back now. This cricket bores me.</quote>
   <p>An answer that combined his boyishness and his authority; his
readiness to accept new suggestions with his assumption that no wish
of his would be contradicted. It did not occur to him that I might
want to stay on and watch the cricket. Like a schoolboy on his way to
a party he chattered without stopping till we reached the large,
barrack-shaped apartment-house on whose highest floor I had a one-room
flat where I keep clothes and papers, that I use as a kind of office
pied-&agrave;-terre when I am in London.
   <p><quote>Is this where you live?</quote> he asked.
   <p>I nodded.
   <p>
   <p>HE looked up inquisitively at its straight sheer surface,
as though he were seeing this particular kind of building for the
first time; as though he were a foreigner obtaining the material for a
monograph <quote>How London Lives</quote>.
   <p>As I opened the cocktail cabinet and set about the preparation of
an <quote>old-fashioned</quote>, he deployed none of the diplomatically assumed
indifference with which it is customary to take stock of a new room
without letting it appear that you are conscious of being in one.
   <p>With an unabashed curiosity he took a mental inventory of the
room: its lighting, its shelves, its chairs, its pictures, the jumble
of knick-knacks along the mantelpiece; then started on a tour of
investigation, taking up a book, peering into an etching, lifting a
cigarette-box; without comment, as though he were visiting an
exhibition, till suddenly, with a note of real interest in his voice,
~<quote>What's that doing here?</quote> he asked.
   <p>He was pointing to the framed original of a jacket design for one
of my novels.
   <p><quote>That? Oh, I'm responsible for that.</quote>
   <p><quote>You drew the picture?</quote>
   <p><quote>No &mdash; wrote the book.</quote>
   <p><quote>What, you, the author!</quote>
   <p>There was a surprised excitement in his voice that I should have
found extremely flattering had not experience counselled me against a
readiness to believe that here, at last, I was about to meet the
perfect, that dream reader whom every novelist is convinced must exist
somewhere, the one reader who has not only read everything that he has
written, but read between the lines.
   <p>On those rare occasions I really am the target at which
enthusiasm is directed, it is usually to receive some such testimonial
as <quote>I've been wanting to meet you for so long. There's a mistake in
that last book but one of yours that I've been longing to point out.
On page thirty-seven you talk about Mildred's gas fire, and in the
last chapter you have coals falling through a grate. Now I wonder if
anyone else has spotted that?</quote>
   <p>Previous experience did not encourage me to expect from my
guest's excitement a long, sympathetic, interpretive analysis of my
short stories. I should have been disappointed if I had.
   <p><quote>There's something I've always wanted to ask you. Was Julia
Thirleigh really the model for your heroine?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well...</quote>
   <p>It is the kind of question that usually a novelist resents;
resents because it is impossible to reply honestly. The answer is
always <quote>Yes and No</quote>. No full-length character is ever a direct
portrait; yet no character that is alive has not been drawn in part
from life. A trick of speech has been borrowed here, a gesture there.
The process of creation must start somewhere; must have some solid
foundation in experience. But by the time the story is quarter
finished, the novelist has forgotten his model altogether; his
character has developed a temperament and destiny of its own.
   <p>
   <p>USUALLY, at least, that is the way it happens. In the case
of Julia Thirleigh it had been rather different; possibly because I
have <quote>put</quote> her into the kind of novel that is less a story than an
argument, that requires distinct types to contrast different points of
view. I needed a character to typify the debutante of the late
nineteen-twenties, the second edition of the Bright Young People, the
London of the slump. And it was just because Julia is herself less a
person than a type that, when I had finished the book, I was
astonished to find how closely my finished character resembled the
model which i had meant to employ merely as a first sketch: so closely
that I did not see how a great many people could fail to recognise
her.
   <p>Through a decade when young women not only claimed, but asserted,
their right to the same independence as their brothers, Julia was the
most discussed of those Londoners whose activities are photographed
week by week in The Tatler and Bystander and Sketch.
   <p>She was not so much famous as notorious. She had avoided, it
is true, any open scandal. She had not shot an unfaithful suitor,
been convicted as a drug addict or cited in the divorce courts. To
that extent she had been discreet.
   <p>At the same time she had been subpoenaed in a slander suit that
had been heard in camera. It was at one of her
bottle-parties in a top-storey studio that a free fight with
gate-crashers had ended in a crumpled figure on the pavement and a
comment from the coroner that only her most loyal friends held to be
unjustified. There had been no open scandal.
   <p>But the clothes she had worn, the company she had kept, her
manner, her habits, her whole way of living had given her the kind of
label that made her current coin in any argument.
   <p><quote>Well now, take somebody like Julia...</quote> and when people said
that, no one had any doubt of what was meant.
   <p>
   <p>PRUDENCE as well as friendship counselled me to show my
manuscript to Julia before I delivered it to my publisher.
   <p>She returned it with a very typical remark.
   <p><quote>I don't use Blue-grass.</quote>
   <p><quote>Is that your only comment?</quote>
   <p><quote>My only criticism.</quote>
   <p><quote>There's nothing there that you object to?</quote> I asked her.
   <p><quote>Why should there be?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well...</quote>
   <p>She smiled.
   <p><quote>Is there anything in your book that people haven't said about
me and believed about me?</quote>
   <p><quote>There's a difference between gossip and a thing said in
print.</quote>
   <p><quote>If your publishers are afraid of libel I'll write them a letter
of absolution.</quote>
   <p>I could scarcely deny, in the face of that, that I had used Julia
as a model, yet I was reluctant to admit that my character was a
photograph.
   <p><quote>In a kind of way,</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>You did? I'd always heard you did, but I wasn't certain. You
must know her, then?</quote>
   <p><quote>I was lunching with her yesterday.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yesterday!</quote>
   <p>He regarded me with a strange veneration, as though I were haloed
in such a light as had transfigured Moses on his descent from Sinai.
   <p>
   <p><quote>YESTERDAY! I can hardly believe it. I've heard so much
about her, read so much about her. It's strange to be meeting
somebody who really knows her. Is she as beautiful as her
photographs? They are all so different.

<text id=LOBP20>
<head>COMPLETE STORY by May Somerset</head>
<head>So she invented George</head>
   <p>To be young &mdash; and alone &mdash; in Paris... What else could either
of them do but pretend they were in love?
   <p>
   <p>JUDY stuck it for two days. Then she revolted. And, being
Judy, she decided she must do something about it.
   <p>Coming to Paris had been the biggest thrill in all the twenty
years of her life. She had got the chance when Mr. Cartwright's
personal assistant had fallen ill at the last moment.
   <p>Judy, who had worked under her, knew more about what this Paris
conference was about than anyone else in the office &mdash; apart from Mr.
Cartwright, of course.
   <p>So, at two days' notice, she was off to Paris.
   <p>Paris in the spring! With mist rising from the Seine in the
early morning and the cafes gaily spilling out across the pavements in
the midday sunshine.
   <p>She could see Notre Dame from her hotel window and the Arc \de
Triomphe from the window of the office where the conference was being
held.
   <p>It was all fabulous. Walking to work, she wanted to sing. At
lunch time she was torn between the desire to window shop and just sit
at a cafe table and watch the world go by.
   <p>It was the evenings that were the trouble.
   <p>Strolling along the streets, exploring Montmartre or the Isle \de
Cite was possible only if she had company. Alone, it was apt to give
the wrong impression. As Judy had found out.
   <p>Another girl would have done; or an aunt or uncle, father or
mother. It didn't have to be a young man; though, naturally, that
would have been better still.
   <p>Judy knew no one in Paris, except Mr. Cartwright, who was
engaged every evening, and who was, anyway, at least sixty.
   <p>But she certainly was not going to spend ten glorious evenings
sitting in her hotel.
   <p>So, something had to be done. And there was something she could
do. At least, there was the possibility of something. Being Judy,
that was enough.
   <p>One other person shared the room she had been given to work in,
when she was not actually in the conference chamber taking notes. He
was the personal assistant to the leader of the other English
delegation.
   <p>His name, she knew, was Charles Hanson. He was tall and lean and
quite heart-stoppingly handsome, or would have been if he hadn't
looked so solemn all the time.
   <p>He sat across the room from her and concentrated on his work.
   <p>Obviously he was immune to females or, at any rate, he was intent
on giving that impression.
   <p>But he was the only possibility. On the third afternoon of her
stay Judy was desperate at the thought of another wasted evening in
front of her.
   <p>She didn't want to scare the poor man across the room. Neither
did she want to give him the impression that she was <quote>that</quote> type of
girl.
   <p>All she wanted was a companion so that she could move freely in
the evenings.
   <p>She'd make quite, quite sure there wouldn't be any
misunderstanding about it.
   <p>So she invented George. Well, perhaps not quite invented.
Because there was a George at home in England and he was apt to
proudly announce he was <quote>her fellow,</quote> and there was no need to
explain that he was five years old and her nephew into the bargain.
   <p>
   <p>COMING back to the office after lunch, Judy stood at the
big window for a moment before she went to her desk.
   <p>Below, in the Champs Elysees, the cars glittered in the sun and
the pedestrians were dappled by leaf shadows.
   <p>Then, abruptly, she turned round.
   <p><quote>Oh, I wish George was here.</quote>
   <p><quote>Eh?</quote> Charles Hanson was already at his desk. He raised his
head, looking a trifle startled.
   <p>Judy crossed to her own desk. <quote>I said I wished George was
here,</quote> she repeated. <quote>He &mdash; he's someone I go about with a lot in
London. It would be so heavenly to have him to go about with here.
What do you do with your evenings here?</quote>
   <p><quote>Er &mdash; so far I've gone for walks.</quote>
   <p><quote>Are you going for one tonight?</quote>
   <p><quote>I &mdash; yes, I thought of doing that.</quote>
   <p><quote>By yourself?</quote>
   <p>He straightened a little. <quote>Certainly by myself. I don't know
anyone in Paris.</quote>
   <p><quote>Neither do I. That's the trouble.</quote>
   <p>She launched herself into her plan. <quote>You see, it's all very
well for you; you can go for walks by yourself, explore anywhere you
like. But I can't; not alone. People seem to &mdash; to get the idea that
I don't really want to be alone.
   <p><quote>I'll go crazy if I have to spend every single evening that I'm
in Paris just sitting in the hotel. Why, I may never get the chance
to come here again.
   <p><quote>It would be all right if &mdash; George was here. But he isn't. So
please, when you go for your walk, may I come with you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Good heavens! Do you know, I never thought of that. I
imagined you'd have lots of friends; be out every night.</quote>
   <p><quote>I haven't and I'm not,</quote> she retorted. <quote>I came at two days'
notice, so there wasn't even time to find out if anyone I knew had
friends in Paris. I know George hasn't.</quote> She had to keep him in
the foreground. <quote>He's never been to Paris.</quote> That was true,
anyhow.
   <p><quote>Wouldn't George mind if you came out with me?</quote>
   <p>Judy felt her colour rising. Thank goodness he had no means of
knowing she always did blush furiously if she had told even the
tiniest and whitest of lies!
   <p><quote>Well, he does rather like me to himself.</quote> That, too, was
true.
   <p><quote>But I can't waste all my evenings here. I want to see so much.
I want to go on buses and the Metro, up to Montmartre and along the
Left Bank. I want to go on a river trip.</quote>
   <p>Then a thought struck her. She had invented George, but, after
all, Charles Hanson might have someone who would prefer that he did
spend his evenings in Paris in lonely solitude.
   <p><quote>Of course, if you've got someone who might not like it...</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I don't think Peggy would take to the idea, but she isn't
here, is she?</quote>
   <p>Suddenly he grinned. <quote>If you'll risk George finding out, I'll
do the same with Peggy. After all, as you obviously can't go around
by yourself I'd be a boor to condemn you to your hotel for the rest of
your evenings in Paris.
   <p><quote>So, shall we say six o'clock, providing this afternoon's
conference doesn't run late. Still, as we'll both be there...</quote>
   <p>They met at six, by the elevators on the ground floor.
   <p>Charles grinned again as she came towards him and Judy found
herself thinking that this Peggy was pretty lucky.
   <p>Plainly, Charles was shy at first, but when his smile was so wide
and friendly you just had to like him.
   <p>As far as the evening was concerned, her plan couldn't have
worked better. She'd been right in thinking that Paris in the
evening, with a companion, would be a simply wonderful place.
   <p>They ate in the Place \de Republique and then went up to
Montmartre and found a fair going on in the streets.
   <p>They talked and laughed with all sorts of people. They had
coffee at several different cafes. They looked down on the twinkling
lights of Paris. And then they walked down the steep streets and back
to her hotel.
   <p><quote>It was marvellous!</quote> There were stars in Judy's eyes. <quote>It's
exactly as I thought it would be.</quote>
   <p>He looked down at her. <quote>You must bring George here, one day,
and show it to him. Is he fun to be with?</quote>
   <p>Because she felt such a stab of guilt she said quickly: <quote>He's
the greatest fun in the world. And I will bring him one day.</quote>
   <p>She'd be grey-haired by the time he was old enough and probably
still a spinster.
   <p><quote>Will you bring Peggy, too?</quote> she asked.
   <p>He hesitated, then he shook his head. <quote>I don't think so. She
finds going abroad too complicated. She's content with Britain.</quote>
   <p>So Paris could stay <quote>theirs.</quote>
   <p>Judy couldn't help her heart giving a little leap. Neither could
she help the malicious little thought that Peggy sounded both drab and
dreary.
   <p>Charles was certainly neither.
   <p>
   <p>SHE took herself to task several times during the next few
days, however. After all, she had thrust herself on to Charles when,
quite obviously, he'd had every intention of staying solitarily true
to Peggy.
   <p>To do anything unfair to Peggy would be mean and despicable.
   <p>But it was a little difficult to remember that when they were
seated, shoulder to shoulder, on a boat on the Seine and there was a
moon overhead.
   <p>Neither was it easy when they walked back to her hotel and their
hands touched and linked for a moment before she pulled hers away.
   <p><quote>George?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>And Peggy,</quote> she retorted, almost sharply.
   <p>He moved a little away from her.
   <p><quote>You're right, of course. But it's been a good evening, hasn't
it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Wonderful.</quote> It was extraordinary how it could hurt to say
just one word.
   <p>It would have been silly &mdash; and it would have admitted things she
didn't want to admit if she had refused to go out with him any more.
   <p>So at the week-end they explored further. They went to St
Cloud and, of course, Versailles.
   <p>The sun continued to shine and Judy wore the summer dresses she
had packed with so much excitement.
   <p>But at night, back in her hotel room, she took to standing at her
window for a long time, leaning on the window sill and looking out at
Paris as it slept.
   <p>She was storing it all up in her heart. Though now, she knew, it
would hurt unbearably every time she remembered it, and she would go
on remembering it all her life.
   <p>Perhaps Charles would remember, too, even if he did have his
Peggy who never wanted to leave England. She certainly couldn't know
what she was missing.
   <p>Charles was lucky; this could fade to a dream for him. He had
someone to put in its place.
   <p>But she &mdash; well, George, at five years old, didn't promise to be
much help, even though she did love him so much.
   <p>Rather ostentatiously she bought postcards for George everywhere
they went. If Charles didn't like it, well, he could buy them for
Peggy, couldn't he?
   <p>Inevitably their last day came, their last evening.
   <p><quote>We're doing a show tonight,</quote> Charles informed her
masterfully. <quote>And a night club afterwards. You're not going back to
George without sampling that side of Paris night life.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>ACTUALLY Judy didn't enjoy it very much. She kept
remembering that tomorrow night she'd be back home, and there would be
no Charles.
   <p>It was her own fault, of course. She had started it all, and if
she'd got hurt there was no one else to blame.
   <p>But it was going to be lonely after tonight. And the loneliness
seemed to have crept into her heart already.
   <p>After they had been at the night club for some time they fell
silent.
   <p>Judy watched the dancers firmly. She mustn't blink or the tears
in her eyes might spill over, and she knew that Charles was looking at
her averted face.
   <p><quote>Ready to go?</quote> He said suddenly.
   <p><quote>Quite ready.</quote> She rose at once.
   <p>But when they were outside neither of them made any attempt to
turn in the direction of her hotel.
   <p>The night club was in Montmartre and, wordlessly, they walked up
towards the Sacre Coeur, and then, in the shadow of the great church,
they turned and looked down over Paris.
   <p>The moon was paling; it was almost dawn.
   <p>Charles said softly: <quote>Shall we see the sunrise? Everyone
should do that once.</quote>
   <p>So they waited, and gradually the sky turned to a pale green and
then to pink and then to misty gold which seemed to envelop
everything.
   <p>Judy knew that if she made the slightest move towards Charles she
would be in his arms.

<text id=LOBP21>
   <p><quote>Tell me, how did you come? Did Weir bring you?</quote>
   <p>Before Linda could make any reply Ralph Batley's voice cut in
sharply from behind her, saying:
   <p><quote>This is my uncle, Mr. MacNally, and this</quote> &mdash; the hand came
past her and rested on the boy's head &mdash; <quote>this is my nephew,
Michael.</quote> Before she could acknowledge the introductions he went
on: <quote>Take Miss Metcalfe up to the house, Uncle Shane.</quote>
   <p><quote>Aye, Ralph. Yes, I'll do that. Will you come along now?</quote>
The old man backed away from her, one arm extended in a courtly
gesture. She felt inclined to laugh. From first impressions she
didn't think she would get many laughs from her employer, but this old
man seemed to be bubbling with a peculiar sense of joy.
   <p>In the yard the wind tore at them, and as the old man steadied
her with his hand on her elbow he yelled: <quote>Have you long come? I've
been away up in the top field, the fence is flat.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, I've just arrived.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then you haven't been in the house at all?</quote> His voice was
high with surprise.
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p>She could feel his bewilderment. <quote>I wondered about your case
there.</quote> He put out his hand for it, and she let him take it from
her.
   <p><quote>Did Weir bring you up? You didn't say.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, Mr. Weir was out.</quote>
   <p><quote>You couldn't have got here afore dark then?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, I lost my way and I arrived at another farm. The name</quote> &mdash;
she paused, then went on &mdash; <quote>the name was Cadwell.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>THE old man came to an abrupt stop and his hand came off
her arm. He turned to the boy and said: <quote>Michael. Here, take hold
of this case and go on up.</quote> He pushed the case and the lamp into
the boy's hands, then added: <quote>Away with you now.</quote> It wasn't until
the child had moved off that he said quickly: <quote>Don't tell me that a
Cadwell brought you up here, then?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, the young man. Rouse, I think his name was.</quote>
   <p><quote>You didn't tell him &mdash; Ralph back there?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I'm afraid I did, I didn't see any reason not to. What
have I done wrong?</quote> There was a tremor of apprehension in her
voice. <quote>I didn't know that Mr. Cadwell and Mr. Batley were at
loggerheads. I'm terribly sorry if I've caused &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>That's all right, you weren't to know, girl, but I don't know
how Maggie will take this. Come,</quote> and he took hold of her arm
again.
   <p>They were walking along a broad flagged terrace now and the wind
was meeting them head-on, and when they reached the porch they both
stood panting for a moment, before the old man said: <quote>I'll take off
me boots. Maggie would brain me if I went in with me boots on.</quote>
Then bending towards Linda he whispered: <quote>Wipe your feet &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Feeling very like a child, Linda did as she was requested, while
she watched him hop from one stockinged foot to the other over the
cold stone flags to the door. When he opened the door the reason was
made plain, for the floor on to which she stepped was polished as she
had never before seen a floor polished.
   <p>But her attention was lifted from the floor to the hall which
opened out before her, for in size and shape it was an exact replica
of the hall of the Cadwells' house. There was the same large open
fireplace. There was the same winding staircase going off to the left
with the balcony running from it along the entire length of the far
wall; yet for all the similarity this hall had nothing of the other's
charm.
   <p>A long black oak refectory table ran lengthways down the hall.
Standing with her back to it was a woman. She was of medium height
with greying hair and had two patches of red high on her cheek bones.
Her expression checked Linda's progress.
   <p>
   <p>THE Cadwells had looked at her each in their own way.
Ralph Batley's appraisal had shown his surprise. The old man had
greeted her gleefully, the boy with wonder; but this woman's look was
so different. It seemed as if she was being called upon to make a
quick decision and was finding the process difficult.
   <p>The woman was now coming towards Linda.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry you've had to find your own way. When you didn't
come at two he thought maybe... anyway he couldn't leave the
calving.</quote> The woman's voice was soft and thick and pleasant, but
before Linda could say anything she had turned on the old man, crying:
<quote>It's your fault. Where d'you think you've been?</quote>
   <p><quote>Now Maggie, whisht a while, I was up in the top field with
the railings as flat as a pancake. You wouldn't have me let the
cattle get through, now would you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh.</quote> She moved her head impatiently then turned to Linda
saying: <quote>Well, come in, come in. Here, let me have your coat.
You'll be frozen.</quote>
   <p>As Linda took off her coat Shane, tripping towards the fire-place
like an aged gnome, said gaily: <quote>She's got her hand in already,
Maggie, she's been helping with the calving.</quote>
   <p><quote>Helping with the calving?</quote> The woman looked up at her
incredulously.
   <p>Linda, going hot with what she knew was to come, said hesitantly:
<quote>Apparently I came in the back way. I saw the light in the byre.</quote>
   <p><quote>You came in the back way? From the main road?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh.</quote> She nodded at Linda, a smile now softening her face.
<quote>Mr. Weir brought you?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p><quote>No. Weir didn't bring her.</quote> They all turned their eyes
towards the door under the balcony through which Ralph Batley was
entering the room. As he came slowly across the hall he said to no
one in particular: <quote>She took the wrong road.</quote>
   <p>She watched him reach up to the high mantelshelf and take a pipe
from out of a wooden rack, then he turned to his mother. But his eyes
remained on the pipe as he said heavily: <quote>She forked right at the
cliff end.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Batley's brown eyes were wide and, unmistakably, there was
fear in them.
   <p>Ralph Batley turned from his mother's gaze to the fire now and
lifting his foot he thrust it into the heart of the blazing logs. A
shower of sparks sprayed around the chimney. Then taking a home-made
spill from out of a bunch and putting it towards the blaze, he said
coldly: <quote>Our neighbours were kind enough to bring her to the top
gate.</quote>
   <p>He was attempting to light an empty pipe. Realising this he
threw the spill into the fire and, as if to cover up his mistake, said
with a poor attempt at lightness: <quote>I'm forgetting, you haven't met
my mother.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Batley's response to this was to say quietly: <quote>You'll be
wanting a wash, will you come up?</quote> She turned about and walked
across the hall. Linda, picking up her case, followed her up the
stairs, along the balcony to the far end. There Mrs. Batley opened
a door, saying over her shoulder: <quote>I hope you'll be quite
comfortable.</quote>
   <p>Linda moved into the room. Then turning quickly about she looked
at the older woman appealingly and said under her breath: <quote>Mrs.
Batley, I seem to have done something wrong. I'm sorry.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Batley stared at her for a moment, then stepping into the
bedroom and closing the door behind her, said: <quote>I'm sorry too, my
dear. I'm sorry you had to start like this. One thing I'll ask of
you, keep away from the</quote> &mdash; she paused here, then brought out &mdash; <quote>the
Cadwells. If you want to work here and in peace, don't even mention
their name. And another thing I would ask you, do your best for him,
will you? You see he never wanted a woman on the place. But I was
for it, and you're not quite what I expected.</quote> She held up her
hand. <quote>No offence meant, but you don't look exactly cut out for this
life. Still, time will tell. Come down when you're ready.</quote>
   <p>She went quickly out of the room leaving Linda staring at the
closed door in bewilderment.
   <p>Slowly she turned and looked about her, and what she saw held
some comfort, for there was a wood fire burning in the grate, the
furniture was old-fashioned but solid and shining. The floor was bare
wood and again highly polished, and before the hearth and by the side
of the bed were two clippie rugs. In the corner stood her trunk and
two cases. This then was her room. It was comfortable and homely,
but all she wanted to do was sit down and cry.
   <p>
   <p>LINDA did not unpack but washed herself and combed her
hair. Yet fifteen minutes later when she went quietly down the
stairs, she could have been dressed for a ball, the way their eyes
turned and watched her approach.
   <p>The table was set now with a white cloth and was laden with food
and she said apologetically: <quote>I hope I haven't kept you all
waiting.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, no, we're just going to start. Come and sit down.</quote>
Mrs. Batley took her seat at one end of the table and indicated a
chair to the right of her.
   <p>Linda had always considered that she had a good appetite although
she may not have shown it in her figure, but she could not attempt to
eat half of the dishes that were offered to her. There was little
talking during the meal except at one stage when Mrs. Batley asked:
<quote>Are your parents in farming?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, but my uncle, my mother's brother, manages a farm.</quote>
   <p>No one made any comment on this and Mrs. Batley put in quickly:
<quote>Well if you've all had sufficient you can make a move to the
fire.</quote>
   <p>Linda's help was accepted by Mrs. Batley without comment.
   <p>When some time later she was standing at the sink drying the
dishes that Mrs. Batley had washed and was searching in her mind for
something to say to break the awkward silence, Mrs. Batley said very
softly: <quote>Were you inside the house?</quote>
   <p><quote>You mean the Cadwells?</quote> Linda's voice, too, was quiet.
   <p>Mrs. Batley nodded.
   <p><quote>Yes, I was in the hall.</quote>
   <p>The older woman flicked her hands downwards into the sink with a
violent movement, and with a harsh bitterness but still under her
breath she said: <quote>I suppose you're comparing it with ours? We
haven't got a hundred-pound carpet nor all the fal-dals .</quote>
   <p>Linda looked at Mrs. Batley who was now thrusting the china
noisily into the cupboard. She found herself pitying this woman, and
she lied as she said softly: <quote>I didn't notice how the place was
furnished. All that I can really remember is that the hall is similar
in shape to yours. But one thing I did notice, the floor and
furniture didn't gleam nearly so much as yours do.</quote>
   <p>Even if it had not been true she would have been bound to say it,
for there was a loneliness emanating from the other woman that touched
Linda.
   <p>As she spoke Ralph Batley came into the kitchen. He looked
neither at his mother nor at Linda but went straight to the back door
and was on his way out when his mother said: <quote>Will she do?</quote>
   <p>For a moment Linda had the awful sensation that the question
referred to herself, but when the reply came: <quote>She'll do all
right,</quote> she was forced to smile. It was the calf they were speaking
about.
   <p>
   <p>IN the living-room Shane was sitting with his feet
stretched out to the blaze but he heaved himself up on her arrival,
saying: <quote>Sit yourself here.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, no, I'll sit here.</quote>
   <p><quote>Do what he says, he's getting selfish enough.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Batley was busy now setting up a framework to the side of
the fireplace and Linda saw it was a half-finished rug. She watched
her drop a carrier bag on Shane's knee, saying: <quote>Get yourself busy,
that'll keep you out of mischief.

<text id=LOBP22>
   <p>Then he lazed back, laughing by her side, motionless in the
sun.
   <p>He used to drink the cheap, warm wine straight from the bottle.
   <p><squote>You first,</squote> he told her, <squote>I want the bottle neck to be
smothered in your kisses.</squote>
   <p>He made her laugh so much that, sometimes, she spilt it down her
dress and left a purple stain on the piqu&eacute; collar.
   <p><squote>When I'm rich,</squote> he cried, <squote>I'll buy you champagne, nothing
but champagne. You can bath in it, drink it, spill it down your dress
and it won't even leave a mark.</squote>
   <p>With these words he sprang to his feet and cried into the
swirling blue, ~<squote>I love her, I love her, I love her... ~It's you I
love, you silly girl... Anna and Hugo... Anna and Hugo...</squote> until
their names echoed and trembled to the distant hills.
   <p>He chased her barefoot over the scented grass and thistledown
until they fell panting into each others  arms on the ground.
Then he gasped for breath, his body humped and contorted as he
clutched at his own throat in convulsive agony and desperation.
Between the coughing and the retching, he begged her: ~<squote>Don't look,
Anna, please don't look at me,</squote> and she would slump to the grass
until it was over. Sometimes, there was blood even on the flowers, on
the daises which had, already, pink-tipped petals.
   <p>The days, the weeks, the months rushed by, express train-like but
with no destination, no beginning and no end. He used to walk to the
studio where he was learning to paint.
   <p><squote>To save money,</squote> he told her, <squote>so I can buy you presents.</squote>
   <p>He bought her books, flowers, bits of cracked and broken junk
which he thought pretty, and sometimes clothes. The mackintosh was
the last thing he ever gave her.
   <p><squote>For once I'm being practical,</squote> he said. <squote>After all, it's
meant to rain in England.</squote>
   <p>He walked everywhere and the endless exercise made him hungry.
She spent twice as much as he saved to appease the hunger and they
both laughed when the false economy dawned on them. She bought him
fruit, meat, cheese and eggs and together they strived to cook them
over the gas-ring in her bedroom with the help of a French cookery
book. Their faces were smudged, their foreheads sweaty, their hands
garnished with garlic and, laughing, they would decide to cook the
English way and fall back on fish and chips.
   <p>In the winter, the snow helped to hide the barrack grimness of
their surroundings. It lay like petals on the deserted garden patch
and even transfigured the limp lines of washing into dazzling
obelisks.
   <p>Hugo's cough seemed better in the snow. He would gather handfuls
off the trees, kiss it, eat it and chase her laughing and crying down
the street, hurling it into her streaming hair.
   <p>He painted her room for her as <squote>white as the snow</squote> he said.
He stripped off the sad wallpaper, almost angrily, and in its place
put up fresh and merry whiteness. She made him hang his paintings on
the walls and could scarcely believe the brilliant transformation.
   <p><squote>This is the first time I've ever hung a painting,</squote> he told
her smiling, <squote>and probably the last.</squote>
   <p>She liked best the pictures of Provence, the fishermen with black
nets drying on platinum sand, the baskets of rainbow fish which still
seemed to squirm in the sun-glitter. She liked the lonely stretches
of Camargue wasteland, wild, melancholy and mysterious; she liked the
vastness of the rice-fields, once mistral-torn and mosquito-ridden.
She loved the pictures of housewives, brawny and good-humoured,
haggling with their Midi accent over the monk fish, the grey mullet,
the tiny squid and the lobsters while the naked starfish sprawled dead
in the sun. Even dead, the colours were dazzling &mdash; silver sea bream;
slithery, bright pink demoiselles; the angler with mad antennae-like
hooks sprouting from its huge head; the gigantic turbot and the sleek,
black dogfish with its greyhound head.
   <p>When she looked at his paintings, she could hear the auction bids
and smell the fish and pebbles, she could feel the sticky salt in the
women's hair and the tired sweat on the men's faces.
   <p>Over and over again, he tried to paint a picture of Anna. He
couldn't. <squote>I love you too much,</squote> he explained. <squote>Anyway, I can
only paint fish and peasants.</squote>
   <p>He made her look sad, he made her look happy but somehow he never
captured the startling strangeness which was Anna. In the winter
evenings, she sat for him hour after hour but, in the end, he hurled
the canvas from the easel, cursing himself and his lack of talent.
She reassured him, told him the light was wrong, that he was tired or
hungry, that she loved the picture and it was more real than she was
herself. Then he burst into laughter and asked: <squote>Do you mind if I
turn you into a fish?</squote>
   <p>And, in half the time, he blotted out her likeness and brought
fiercely to life, the sea-glimmer, sunlight, fishwives and the sparkle
of salt water on sealy skin and delicate fins. His excuse was always
the same.
   <p><squote>You see I love you too much, I can't paint the woman I love,
the only woman I've ever loved.</squote>
   <p><squote>The only one?</squote> she asked him.
   <p>He looked at her through flickering lashes, half smiling.
   <p><squote>The only one,</squote> he repeated. <squote>The others were just games.</squote>
   <p><squote>What do you call games, Hugo?</squote>
   <p>Then he looked guilty like a child caught stealing an apple.
   <p><squote>Well,</squote> he said kissing her cheek, <squote>I knew them in the
biblical sense. They were nothing to me, just nothing.</squote>
   <p>Biblical sense or no, she felt sad and jealous and questioned him
closely as to their names and faces. Whereupon he swept her into his
arms and carried her struggling to the bed.
   <p><squote>There,</squote> he said as he knelt on the floor by her side, <squote>on
bended knee I swear it. The only one, it's you.</squote>
   <p>He lay his cheek upon hers, silent for a while, then he whispered
in her hair: <squote>Anna, make love with me, real love... please do.</squote>
   <p>Before she could think or answer him, he was a tangled heap on
the floor, a spitting, gasping heap, half-sobbing, half-human.
   <p>She ran out to get some water and, when she came back, she found
him lying on her bed, laughing.
   <p><squote>So I have to make do with this, do I?</squote> He held up her
portrait still wet and sticky. <squote>It's prettier than you, you brutal
angel.</squote>
   <p><squote>There's not so much of it though,</squote> she answered truthfully.
   <p>Thereupon he jumped up and said that he was hungry.
   <p><squote>And all because of you,</squote> he told her as he kissed her, clung
to her and led her away. She was glad it hadn't happened. She didn't
want to be a game, not even in the biblical sense. Anyway, he was too
ill and she loved him too much.
   <p>Her mother enjoyed having Hugo in the house, her father resented
him. He didn't like to see other people happy around him. It wasn't
his Methodist upbringing, it was just his nature. He was like a damp
cartridge; however much force or pressure was brought to bear, nothing
happened. He never exploded, either joyfully or angrily. He was
simply an unfriendly maggot that you might find under a stone. She
and Hugo had a secret language which they spoke with their eyes and
their hands, and many was the mad, snuffed-out laughter conversation
they carried on behind her father's disapproving newspaper. He was
only concerned that Hugo should pay his rent, not put French coins in
the gas-meter slot and not seduce his daughter. The third condition
was the least important of the three.
   <p>Sometimes Anna wondered if he knew that she wasn't his daughter.
But of course he knew and that made it worse. He didn't mind, he
didn't want children of his own or despise his wife's illegitimate
one. It was this complete indifference to everything, whether mental
or physical, that astonished and terrified Anna. On both counts he
was a miser. He gave nothing, he took nothing but he resented
everything.
   <p>She could recall Hugo's farewell so clearly. It was so vivid
that she often wondered if it had not occurred the day before and
whether it were not just another good-night with another greeting in
the morning. It had been July, almost three years to a day since he
first appeared in their lives.
   <p><squote>We must pretend it's for a day,</squote> he said, <squote>because we know
it's only a month and then we'll be together for the rest of our
lives.</squote>
   <p><squote>A day,</squote> she repeated slowly, <squote>but even a day without you is
a lifetime.</squote>
   <p><squote>While I'm away ,</squote> he said, <squote>you must write to me every
single day and I'll write to you. You know I can't live without you
so promise me you will.</squote>
   <p>She didn't even bother to promise &mdash; it was so unnecessary.
   <p><squote>Don't come to the station,</squote> he begged her, <squote>I'll burst into
tears and make a fool of myself.</squote>
   <p>Nevertheless, she had gone and each tormented minute had been a
tiny stretch of happiness. He leaned from the carriage window and
clung to her, unaware of the selfish noise and activity of a
boat-train crowd and they &mdash; unaware of him. He begged her, made her
swear to go on loving him for ever and never to see, touch or talk to
another man. The whistle went and she brushed the tears from his eyes
with her hand.
   <p><squote>Keep one,</squote> he said smiling.
   <p><squote>I have my own,</squote> she replied.
   <p>The train shuddered, gathered speed and was gone.
   <p>The blurred heads of holiday-makers leaned out, waving and
kissing to the platform of spectators, to the litter of squash
cartons, ice-cream wrappers and separation. She walked away as in a
trance, walking always forward but always left behind. No one noticed
her. On a boat-train station, people look sad or happy &mdash; there is no
in between. She went home and looked at her face in the glass. It
was like a mask of granite which cannot melt, break or be crushed. It
seemed to have no reason for being there at all &mdash; simply a memento of
the past. She assured herself that in a month everything would begin
again as sweetly and smoothly as winding a clock. She wrote to him
every day for a week and every single day she waited for his answer.
There was no question of his letters becoming colder, wearier or less
affectionate. There were no letters &mdash; it was as simple as that. The
postman came to know her face quite well &mdash; it was white and drawn and
seemed scarcely to exist. He gave her gas bills, butcher bills and
canvassing pamphlets but her fingers sorted through them hungrily and
she closed the door and thanked him.
   <p>She made the lodgers' beds, went to work and returned at night to
wait for the morning. After a week, she stopped writing letters
altogether and after a month she sobbed herself to sticky sleep each
night and woke to the swollen-eyed dawn. From that time forth, she
lived in the past and three years' recollection offers a sort of
companionship although it has no future. She walked down the streets
where they had walked together, went to the same pubs and caf&eacute;s,
visited the same museums and cinemas and even took bus-rides into the
country where each blade of grass reminded her of him. She wondered
if he were ill, she wondered if he were dead and suddenly she realized
that she was the ill one, the dead one, the idiot and the possessed.
   <p>Her father was glad it had all ended; her mother was too busy to
comment. <squote>Find yourself a nice steady man,</squote> he told her, <squote>not a
choking, arty-crafty foreigner.</squote> And he returned to his evening
paper in justified and contented humour, pleased that he'd been right
all along and that his day was over.

<text id=LOBP23>
<quote>I felt sure that you would like her, Bill.</quote>
   <p><quote>We got on famously,</quote> he replied curtly, finding it next to
impossible to discuss Betty like this. <quote>But tell me more about your
mother, Kay. Is all need for anxiety at an end? You must have had a
very worrying time of it, poor old girl!</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, it's been anything but pleasant,</quote> she replied.
<quote>Naturally, I was very disappointed about not having this holiday
with you, Bill. I'd so looked forward to getting away with you alone.
As it is, we shall only have a few days to ourselves, for I suppose I
ought to get back to mother as soon as I possibly can. But never
mind, it won't be long before we shall be married, and then we shall
be together always!</quote>
   <p>It was the first time Kay had ever spoken to him in such a strain
about their approaching marriage, and, somehow the remark jarred on
herself almost as much as it did on Bill.
   <p>He said hastily &mdash;
   <p><quote>It's quite a long time to September, Kay.</quote>
   <p><quote>But the time will go so quickly, what with one thing and
another. Buying the furniture for one thing &mdash; won't it be exciting,
Bill, choosing just what we like? You can't imagine how happy and
excited I feel about it all.</quote>
   <p>Bill's heart smote him. Poor Kay! He had sinned against her,
unwillingly, it is true, but nevertheless he had sinned, and however
he looked at things, he saw pain for her in the future.
   <p>He said gently &mdash;
   <p><quote>It &mdash; it's awfully decent of you to care so much about me, Kay.
I'm not really worth it, you know. You're the sort of girl almost
any man would be glad and proud to marry.</quote>
   <p><quote>But, Bill, you are the only one I want to feel like that,</quote>
she said, squeezing his arm, and feeling more reassured. <quote>Let's sit
here for a few minutes, shall we? This boulder looks very
inviting.</quote>
   <p>It had to be the same boulder that he and Betty had sat upon so
often. Bill gave an inward groan. He felt that the situation was
getting beyond him.
   <p>
   <p>Meanwhile, Betty, feeling wretched and unsettled, had collected
her belongings and stowed them away in the suitcases she had packed so
gaily before setting out for this eventful holiday. This done, she
contemplated with dismay the solitary hours that lay before her, with
only miserable thoughts for company, and yet dreaded still more the
return of the other two.
   <p>In the end she went to one of the cinemas and tried to forget her
own problems by becoming absorbed in those of the people depicted on
the screen.
   <p>It was time for supper when she returned to the boarding-house,
and after one anxious glance at the faces of the two lovers, she
heaved a sigh of profound relief. It was obvious that Bill had been
behaving himself correctly and that Kay suspected nothing.
   <p>Betty forced herself to a display of high spirits and gaiety
which she was very far from feeling, and in which she was assisted by
Bill, who, by now, had reluctantly decided that Kay must be kept in
the dark as much as possible concerning the wrong they had done her.
   <p>Kay's unusual display of affection had touched his heart, even
while it had increased his sense of despair and hopelessness, for Bill
realised that all chances of making her a really good and loving
husband were forever dead.
   <p>After supper, they all three went on the pier to listen to the
band, and if the sweet, lilting music woke Betty's heart to fresh
agony, she gave no sign. It was only for a few hours longer that she
would have to wear her mask and act her role.
   <p>And afterwards? Shudderingly she acknowledged to herself that
she dared not face what lay before her. <quote>Sufficient to the day,</quote>
she told herself drearily, looking at the sea, upon which the magic
moonlight shone with the same radiant beauty it had displayed on the
previous night, when it had so thoroughly bewitched herself and Bill.
   <p>Oh, how gloriously happy she had been during those few fleeting
moments of time! They were engraved upon the tablets of her memory
for ever; they marked for her the pinnacle of life &mdash; throbbing,
emotion-packed moments, in which, for the first time in her life, she
had seemed to really live.
   <p>The contrast between that time and this was too sharp, too
poignant. She longed to plunge into that silvered sea and swim and
swim into forgetfulness!
   <p><quote>To-morrow I shall be thinking of all this,</quote> she said.
   <p><quote>Yes, Betty, and you'll be sorry you deserted us,</quote> Kay
replied. <quote>We shall have to come here for our holiday next year and
make it a proper one,</quote> she added, smiling wanly.
<head>CHAPTER 4</head>
<head>LOVE'S ORDEAL</head>
   <p>NEXT morning Betty bade them both good-bye and returned to
London.
   <p>For one long moment Bill held her hand and looked deep into her
glorious brown eyes which held his world, and there passed between
them that same irresistible electric thrill which had signalled the
avowal of their love.
   <p>Then he had stepped back, without uttering a word, and Kay had
raised her face and kissed her friend. A moment later, the guard's
whistle gave its shrill warning, and the train started on its way.
   <p>Betty felt a strange sensation as she looked out of the window
and watched the figures of Kay and Bill diminish, and then disappear
from view. She told herself that she would do her best never to see
either of them again. Yes, it was strange  a sad sensation,
and her eyes were misty as she sank back into her seat.
   <p>So it was over at last! All that now remained was for her to
face reality with as brave a heart as she could muster. A little
desperately Betty told herself that there must be other things in life
besides love. She had been happy and content enough before she had
fallen a victim to its magic spell &mdash; why shouldn't she be able to
recapture that old, gay, careless contentment which, up to now, had
been all she had asked of life?
   <p><quote>I'm glad that Kay will never know,</quote> she murmured to herself,
as she watched the beautiful summer landscape fly past the carriage
window.
   <p>And again, late that night, as she lay tossing restlessly in bed,
she murmured &mdash;
   <p><quote>Yes, I'm glad that Kay will never know!</quote>
   <p>Even that cause of thankfulness would have been denied her, had
she known of what was taking place at almost that selfsame moment
between Kay and Bill.
   <p>After supper, they had wandered, a little aimlessly, down to the
water's edge, where once again the moon spread that shining track of
silver light which seemed to lead to some far-away enchanted country.
When they reached a deserted stretch of beach, Kay pointed to a
nearby groyne.
   <p><quote>Let's sit down,</quote> she said, and even to Bill, preoccupied as
he was with his secret thoughts, her voice sounded strange. <quote>I &mdash; I
want to ask you something, Bill.</quote>
   <p>Somehow, he seemed to know, without being told, what she was
going to ask him. There had been a brooding look in Kay's eyes, and
an absent-mindedness in her manner which, subconsciously, must have
warned him, for he sensed at once that she discovered the truth.
   <p><quote>I think I can guess what you wish to ask me, Kay,</quote> he
stammered.
   <p><quote>Then &mdash; then it is true? You are in love with Betty, aren't
you, Bill?</quote>
   <p>It was impossible for him to deny it, for a moment or two, his
lips refused to frame the words. But at last he spoke.
   <p><quote>Please let us not speak of it, Kay,</quote> he said. <quote>It was
Betty's earnest wish that you should know nothing of it.</quote>
   <p><quote>No wonder &mdash; she's too ashamed, of course,</quote> Kay returned
hotly.
   <p><quote>That's not very charitable of you, Kay, in view of the fact
that Betty has left here solely for your sake. Don't you
understand? She voluntarily gave me up because of you.</quote>
   <p><quote>You were not hers to give up,</quote> Kay retorted.
   <p><quote>Anyway, she knew that my love was hers,</quote> Bill admitted, in a
low voice.
   <p>Kay closed her eyes. A sharp pang of pain shot through her at
his words.
   <p><quote>Bill &mdash; Bill, my darling, you are not going to give me up, are
you?</quote> she cried. <quote>Please &mdash; please don't, Bill! It's only an
infatuation. It cannot last &mdash; it can mean nothing to you in view of
the long and deep affection we have felt for each other. Bill dear,
my life will be completely ruined if you throw me over. Oh, I could
never face such a thing! You are my world, my all!
   <p><quote>This &mdash; this sudden infatuation you feel for Betty will pass.
It cannot possibly last, Bill. You have not known her long enough
for it to mean anything to you. Oh, Bill dear,</quote> Kay pleaded in a
broken voice, <quote>please don't throw me over after all this time, for
the sake of a girl you have hardly known for a week!</quote>
   <p>Such impassioned words, coming from the usually calm, reserved
Kay, went straight to Bill's heart. He could not bear to see her
humbled thus before him &mdash; this girl who had promised to be his wife
and to whom he owed fidelity and respect and love.
   <p><quote>Of course I'm not going to throw you over, Kay, dear,</quote> he
said quickly. <quote>Why, Betty wouldn't hear of such a thing. That's why
she has gone away, as I've already told you. She refuses to have
anything more to do with me. She has behaved very nobly, Kay.
Listen, my dear, I asked you to marry me, didn't I? And I'm going to
do my very best to make you happy.</quote>
   <p>Over her bent head, Bill's eyes were fixed in misery on a fast
vanishing hope of ultimate happiness. Betty was right. Kay must not
be forsaken; for decency's sake he must keep his pledged word to her.
   <p>The sound of Kay's quiet weeping came to him, and resolutely he
set himself to ease her injured feelings.
   <p><quote>Don't cry, darling,</quote> he said. <quote>You are right; all this
unhappiness will pass. It will seem like some vanished dream from
which we have awakened to reality once more. You will try to forgive
me, won't you, Kay dear? It all happened before I was really aware of
it. Believe me, Kay, I'm just as fond of you as ever I was &mdash; yes,
just as fond of you, my darling.</quote>
   <p>Kay longed, but did not dare, to ask him if he cared more for her
than he did for Betty, but she knew the desolate answer to that
question. Instead she said &mdash;
   <p><quote>Of course I shall forgive you, Bill, fully and freely. Betty
is a very attractive girl and no doubt she took advantage of the close
proximity into which you were thrown. Anyway, let us never speak of
it again, Bill &mdash; let it be buried and forgotten for ever.</quote>
   <p><quote>It shall be as you wish, Kay,</quote> he answered, but more coldly,
for he strongly resented the injustice she was doing to Betty.
<quote>Let's go somewhere and find a sherry, shall we?</quote> he added. <quote>It
may cheer us up a bit.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, and we'll drink to our future happiness, Bill!</quote> she
answered, raising her face to his for a kiss.
   <p>But of all this Betty knew nothing, of course. The days went by
slowly and wearily. She was longing for the time to come for her to
return to the office. Her parents had gone to Wales to visit an aged
aunt, and most of Betty's pals were equally inaccessible, so that for
a time solitude was her portion.
   <p>She had plenty of leisure to dwell upon those vanished days spent
with the man she loved &mdash; days of golden sunshine and music and utter
happiness.
   <p>The knowledge that she might never see Bill again was very bitter
to her, but it couldn't be helped.

<head>CONCLUDING Woman SERIAL by MARGARET SUMMERTON</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY WALTER WYLES</head>
<head>the Sea House</head>
<head>Out of violence and fear love could still flourish. For now love
was theirs</head>
   <p>A MOMENT after the kitchen dresser had swung to and left us
in the darkness of the secret passage, there was a sudden, blinding
light. Ivor had switched on a torch.
   <p>Esmond grunted: <quote>Bolt the door. It'll give us an extra half
hour while either Mark or Adkins gets hold of a crowbar. Then go
ahead, shine the light backwards.</quote>
   <p>There was the long, sustained whisper of oiled metal moving, and
then Ivor stumbled over my feet. My wrists, stinging with cramp, were
free from Esmond's grasp.
   <p><quote>Don't start making a fuss all over again Charlotte, there's a
good girl,</quote> Esmond said. <quote>Save your breath. You've got a long
climb. Follow Ivor. I'm right behind you.</quote>
   <p>The steps went on and on; sometimes steeply, sometimes on a wide,
low incline, and the depths of the treads varied.
   <p>After ten minutes, Ivor had gone so far ahead that it was dark.
My head struck rock, my feet misjudged the step and I fell with a
scream.
   <p>Esmond's arm came round my waist, but there was no resilience
left in me to help him.
   <p><quote>I can't breathe,</quote> I whispered. <quote>I'm choking.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, you're not. This is the worst patch. You've only about
another hundred yards to go. Come on.</quote> He heaved me upright, and
half carried me to a point where the steps ended.
   <p>
   <p>IVOR had set the lamp on the floor. He stood over it,
visible to his waist, the rest of him a formless shadow. We were in a
cave. As Esmond put me down, I lifted my arm. I could just touch the
roof.
   <p>The air was a little sweeter but it was still heavy and my breath
came in gasps. I would have given ten years of my life for sight of
the sky.
   <p>I began to beat my hands against the slime-covered walls. I
cried out one word repeatedly: it was Mark.
   <p><quote>Don't, Charlotte. You've got to stick it out for another few
minutes.</quote> With hands that had suddenly grown protective, Esmond
turned me round, pushed the hair from my forehead. <quote>You and Mark
have got the rest of your lives to fix yourselves up. But this small
piece of you belongs to me. If you don't stay with me until I get
into the open, I'm finished, Charlotte.</quote>
   <p><quote>You've no chance,</quote> I said, repeating Mark's words. <quote>There
isn't a yacht waiting for you...</quote>
   <p><quote>Probably not.</quote> He shrugged his shoulders. <quote>But if I can
get clear, make the beach, I'll find some sort of boat...</quote>
   <p>I glanced over my shoulder. Ivor had moved a little out of the
range of the light.
   <p><quote>Why did you come in here? If you're afraid of what he might
do?</quote> I asked Esmond.
   <p><quote>He wouldn't have given me a chance to do anything else. He'd
have shot us all down, made his own getaway alone.</quote>
   <p><quote>What's he doing?</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't panic. He's clearing the way ahead. Except for an air
passage, the way out of this cave is blocked with stones and old
rubbish. After that, there's a low tunnel, one last cave... From
there, out on the cliffs, the odds are against him, not me. I know
every foxhole a darned sight better than he does. I'll leave you
there, Charlotte, and you can double back to Mark. He'll have the
door down by then.</quote> He raised his voice that he had held to a
whisper. <quote>All clear, Ivor?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>AS he pushed me forward Ivor moved into the light. There
was a glint of metal in his right hand. Esmond laughed, and in the
same second pulled me back hard against him, a living shield between
him and the threat of the gun.
   <p><quote>Just as I thought,</quote> he said shortly. <quote>My insurance has paid
off.</quote>
   <p>I froze against him, as Ivor, giant-size in that low cavern,
moved one step, then another towards us. I felt Esmond's left hand
move down to grapple in his pocket.
   <p>Then he shouted: <quote>If you want to kill me, you've got to kill
her first.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're at the end of the line, Elliot,</quote> Ivor said in a voice
of steel.
   <p>Esmond screamed: <quote>You'll have to shoot her first. Lisa won't
be so keen to have a double murderer on her hands, you'll find.</quote>
   <p>Their voices overlapped and were trapped in the echo.
   <p><quote>Lisa's finished with you. You're a wastrel, a sponger,</quote> Ivor
hissed.
   <p><quote>You never meant me to get out of here alive... Webster... and
the boat, they were a pack of lies... Mark was right.</quote> Esmond was
now gasping for breath.
   <p><quote>Of course he was right... You're going to die, Elliot, and the
girl can go with you...</quote>
   <p>The gun in Esmond's hand spat. The light was gone. In the
sudden, blinding darkness I managed to wrench myself free of Esmond's
grasp and dive to the ground. There was a tumult of noise and the
spatter of fire. Something struck my arm. There was no pain after
the first searing blow, only numbness, and sticky warmth trickling
over my hand.
   <p>For a moment I crouched there, dazed, then I stood up and shouted
as loudly as the breath in my lungs would allow.
   <p>Almost immediately I heard the scraping of heavy, stumbling feet,
a voice choking in curses, a fall that sent stones tumbling. Then
silence again, and after timeless seconds, a long-drawn-out gasp.
   <p><quote>Esmond! Esmond!</quote> The echo mocked my cry. I fumbled
frantically in the darkness, bending double, brushing the wet, filthy
floor with my hands... Then I fell over the prone figure that was
still moaning and dropped to my knees.
   <p>I whispered: ~<quote>Esmond!</quote> not sure in the blackness whether it
was he or Ivor.
   <p>He breathed the first syllable of my name. I shifted his head to
my knee. It was heavy, and when I felt his face it was wet... or was
it my fingers that were coated with my own blood or slime from the
cave?
   <p>My hands on his shoulders moved down to his chest, and then
dropped away as he gave a terrible scream. I bent my head until my
face was over his mouth, trying to make words out of the senseless
mumble that followed the cry of agony. But they made no sense.
   <p>And then, behind me, I heard another sound: slow, dragging,
tortuous. I froze, my body bent over Esmond, my hand grasping the gun
that was, miraculously, lying on the ground beside my finger tips.
Ivor was moving.
   <p>
   <p>THEN he was on me, his foot tripping over my leg; my teeth
bit my lower lip to stem the scream, and my free hand covered Esmond's
mouth. Beneath the weight of his body I willed my limbs to stay stiff
and waited to feel the touch of his hand that would tell him Esmond
and I weren't dead. In that moment my finger found the trigger of the
gun.
   <p>Would I have pulled it? I don't know, because the weight
gradually heaved itself from me. Footsteps, scuffling, uncertain,
dragged themselves away, and finally, there was utter silence.
   <p>I lifted my shoulders, eased the burden on my knees, and
waited...
   <p>I fought hard not to wake up. Desperately I clung to the
remnants of unconsciousness, burrowing in the thinning layers, trying
to ignore the pain in my arm and a voice that called my name.
   <p>But the voice and the pain were winning. A hand on my shoulder
scattered the last fragments and I cried out.
   <p>The voice said: <quote>I'm sorry, but it's time you woke up,
Charlotte.</quote>
   <p>Odd, I thought, it sounded like Edwina's voice. I opened my
eyes. The room was full of daylight.
   <p><quote>There! You'll be perfectly all right know.</quote> Her voice was
relieved.
   <p>I pushed myself up on the pillows. <quote>What time is it?</quote> I
asked.
   <p><quote>Almost ten o'clock.</quote> She glanced at my arm. <quote>You're not to
worry about that. It was only a simple flesh wound. Dr. Farnes
stitched it up for you last night.</quote>
   <p>I was still only half awake.
   <p><quote>Could I have a cup of tea?</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>Ivy is bringing you your breakfast as soon as she can manage
it, but she's all behind this morning. Nothing has been done
properly. It's all extremely upsetting.</quote>
   <p>I stared at her. The memory of the afternoon and evening before
came faltering back to me, in patches. I could feel the dazzle of the
torches as Mark, Adkins and the others reached me in the cave.
   <p><quote>Are you hurt, Charlotte?</quote> Mark had gently eased me upright,
away from Esmond.
   <p>Adkins had bent over the body that I had guarded, and a whole
world of tortured waiting passed before Adkins said: <quote>I'm afraid
there's nothing else we can do for him. Mr. Halliwell, I suggest
you help Miss Elliot back to the house. I'll follow you.</quote>
   <p>Even now, I could hear my own voice crying out, and Mark saying:
<quote>Hush, darling. He's dead. I've got to get you out of here.</quote>
   <p>I could remember nothing after that but a close-up of Dr.
Farnes's face as he bent over me, and his cheerful voice saying:
<quote>Now don't worry, young lady. This isn't going to hurt you. You're
going to have a nice, long sleep.</quote>
   <p>I twisted round, so that I could look fully at Edwina. Her face
was grey and pinched, but from the light in her eye I could tell she
was on the brink of reading me a lecture.
   <p>I cried out accusingly: <quote>Esmond need never have died if you
hadn't given him away. You came straight back here yesterday
afternoon and telephoned Inspector Adkins. How could you be so
cruel?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>SHE shook her head at me, patiently admonishing, as if I
were a child. <quote>If you commit murder, Charlotte, you must be
punished.</quote>
   <p>I said: <quote>Why did you play that horrible cat and mouse game if
you knew Esmond was there?</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't know he was there until I saw the way that dog
behaved, that the dresser hinges had been mended and oiled, and the
attic was bolted. When that meddlesome policeman forced himself on me
in the morning with his story of Esmond being alive, I didn't believe
him.</quote>
   <p>She leaned forward, said fiercely: <quote>And do you know why I
didn't believe him?</quote>
   <p>I shook my head.
   <p><quote>Because if he were speaking the truth it meant that all of you,
and you in particular, Charlotte, had wilfully deceived me. Do you
think it's pleasant to learn that a granddaughter to whom you've given
nothing but kindness, whom you've tried to love, is sheltering the
murderer of...</quote>
   <p>She broke off, as if Danny's name was too precious to be spoken
before me. For a moment her eyes closed and then she recovered
herself. <quote>I'd never have believed you were capable of such deceit.
However, it is Mark I blame for the way you behaved. I shall never
forgive him. He's to leave this house...</quote>
   <p>I broke in on her tirade. <quote>That's not how it happened at all.
I found Esmond. Mark wanted to go to the police. I wouldn't let
him.</quote>
   <p><quote>Let him! Let him!</quote> she burst out. <quote>A grown man should be
the keeper of his own conscience, not at the mercy of a silly,
sentimental girl. And a fine help he was to you! You might have been
killed.</quote>
   <p><quote>Where is he now?</quote> I asked.
   <p><quote>Where you'd expect him to be! Explaining his conduct to the
police.</quote>
   <p>There was a fumbling at the door, and Ivy came in, breathless,
awkward.
   <p>When she'd gone, Edwina bent over me. <quote>You've got an egg. I
gave orders for it. And there's some honey. That'll do you good.</quote>
   <p><quote>I just want the tea,</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>Oh, no,</quote> she protested. <quote>You must eat a good breakfast. I
can't promise you what the rest of the meals will be like today.
Mrs. West has left, you know.
<QUOTE>

<text id=LOBP25>
Mrs. Crichton smiled at Tandy.
   <p><quote>Come into the drawing-room, dear, and talk to us.</quote> And, as
Tandy followed her into the room, and Mr. Crichton got up to greet
her, Mrs. Crichton added: <quote>If this visit is what we think, Tandy,
I hope you're as pleased about it as we are.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm delighted,</quote> she said. <quote>Marion's such a darling.</quote>
   <p><quote>And your brother is the first young man I've ever encountered
that I'd trust my girl to,</quote> said Mr. Crichton.
   <p>Ten minutes or so later, and looking like a girl who had been
very thoroughly kissed, Marion came into the room, Jock's hand in her
own.
   <p><quote>Mummy &mdash; Daddy &mdash; we &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Gently, smiling, Jock interposed. <quote>Marion, my love, I have an
idea that if my sister has had anything to do with this, they won't
need telling. But, just for the record, we're engaged!</quote>
   <p>After that, everyone seemed to be kissing everyone else!
   <p>Intermingled with her pleasure for them, Tandy felt a private
little glow of happiness. For so long, now, she'd felt responsible
for Jock, whether or not he would have wanted it. And now &mdash; he had a
grand girl like Marion to look after him, and she herself would be
free.
   <p>Free... to let her love for Granville rule her life for ever.
Long after she and Jock had got back to the flat, she lay awake
thinking of Granville.
   <p>She'd see him again tomorrow, but not till tomorrow night. That
meant the whole of a long day to live through first. I'm wishing my
whole life away, she thought, and smiled gently to herself. It was
worth living through hours of tedium, for those precious hours with
Granville in the evening.
   <p>Next morning at breakfast, Jock said: <quote>Don't do anything about
supper for me tonight, Tandy. Marion and I want to go out to
celebrate our engagement. We shan't be buying the ring until the
weekend, but tonight I want to take her out to the best dinner I can
find!</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, Jock.</quote> For a moment, Tandy felt sad, thinking that many
of the pleasures most engaged couples shared would be missing for Jock
and Marion. Dances, theatres, cinemas. She herself had never worried
about any of them, but then she hadn't grown up in a city as Marion
had. Would Marion mind? Yes, sometimes. But reassurance came to
Tandy in the knowledge that Marion adored Jock. Being with him was
what would matter most to her in life, now and always.
   <p><quote>I'm beginning to feel a bit conscience-stricken about you,
Tandy,</quote> Jock said suddenly. <quote>I'm a selfish devil. When you're
happy as I am, you're apt to forget &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Forget what, Jock?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well &mdash; if we get married &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Listen, Jock dear, when you get married, if you want this flat
I'll move out. It's as simple as that. I can go into a hostel, or
get digs with one of the other girls at the college. Or &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He didn't even hear the other word as it trembled softly as a
whisper. She didn't finish the sentence. She just couldn't &mdash; yet.
But, she thought, as she started on her way to the college &mdash; maybe
Jock wasn't the only member of the family to have exciting news this
week. Only, until Granville really told her, she could say nothing to
Jock at all.
   <p>The sun was shining and Tandy's heart was singing as she crossed
George Street that evening and made her way down to Princes Street for
the bus to the studio.
   <p><quote>You're late!</quote> Granville said almost accusingly, as she walked
into the studio.
   <p><quote>Sorry &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>So you should be, my sweet. Don't you know I've been counting
the minutes, all day, till you came!</quote>
   <p>He moved to her and took her into his arms, and the wonder of his
kiss blotted out everything.
   <p><quote>Granville &mdash;</quote> she said at last, shakily.
   <p><quote>Yes, my love! That's just to keep you quiet till I finish the
picture! With any luck we'll be through with it tonight!</quote>
   <p>She didn't bother to change. He'd finished the painting of the
dress last night and it was only work on her face and arms that was
left. She took up the familiar pose with a kind of sadness in her
heart because it was the last time.
   <p>Yet it was stupid to be sad. The picture meant something;
certainly. It had brought them together. It would, she thought, be a
symbol...
   <p>As she stood, feeling the familiar fatigue creep over her,
Granville suddenly threw down his brushes.
   <p><quote>Well, Tandy? I didn't let you see it properly before. What do
you think?</quote>
   <p>Tandy walked over to the easel and then stopped, frowning.
<quote>She &mdash; she's prettier than I am, Granville,</quote> she said at last.
   <p><quote>Nonsense. Your trouble is that you don't know how damned
attractive you are.</quote> She could see she'd annoyed him, even with the
implied criticism, and she didn't know what to do to put things right.
But it was true. The picture was of a very pretty girl in a white,
full-skirted evening dress. But &mdash; it wasn't her. She couldn't have
said where it failed, except that the eyes staring out of the canvas
had a boldness which was quite alien to Tandy.
   <p><quote>It's &mdash; very nice,</quote> she managed to say at last.
   <p><quote>Nice! That's a stupid word. I tell you it's my best ever.
I'm going to submit it for the next Exhibition in London.</quote>
   <p>She smiled. Seeing his pleasure in the picture she forgot the
doubts in her own mind.
   <p><quote>And now,</quote> Granville said, <quote>we'll go down and have a drink
and then perhaps go out for some food.</quote>
   <p>He went through to the bathroom to remove the paint from his
hands, and she sat quietly on the settee, wondering why it was that
she felt strangely flat and disappointed.
   <p>Perhaps she was tired; she hadn't slept much last night. But,
perhaps, a little of it was reaction, because the picture that had
kept them together all this time was finished &mdash; and she didn't like it
as much as she'd thought she would.
   <p><quote>Ready, my love?</quote> Granville came through and pulled on his
jacket. He took her hand as they walked to the door, and just as they
reached it, he took her into his arms again.
   <p><quote>Sweet Tandy,</quote> he said, huskily, <quote>beloved Tandy. Oh, Tandy,
I'm crazy about you, my love.</quote> They stood locked together in an
embrace which made Tandy's head swim and then they slipped down the
staircase and along the road to the hotel.
   <p><quote>A quick drink,</quote> Granville had said, <quote>and then we're going a
bit farther afield.</quote>
   <p>His car was in the garage and Tandy waited for him in the hotel
lounge till he'd collected it, feeling, as she always did, out of
place among the smart people who invariably patronised this favourite
bar of Granville's. As she saw Granville coming back, she rose to go.
A voice, just a little louder than perhaps was intended, floated
towards her.
   <p><quote>Yes, that's Granville's latest. Cradle-snatching, isn't he?</quote>
   <p>She felt the blood rush to her head. Granville's latest! Just
as if she was some girl he'd picked up and would drop again when he
was tired of her! It wasn't like that, she thought fiercely, it just
wasn't. Granville loved her.
   <p>Granville saw her expression and frowned. <quote>What's the matter,
my sweet?</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothing &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He didn't persist as, irrationally enough, she'd wanted him to.
He just said: <quote>If one of the lads has been making cracks, I'll deal
with him. But any young woman who goes around with me is apt to get
some, Tandy. That's fair warning, my girl &mdash;</quote>
   <p>His tone was light.
   <p><quote>Where are we going,</quote> she asked as they got into the car.
   <p><quote>On a tour of inspection. There's a place I particularly want
you to see by moonlight... It's there, complete, even to the wishing
well, my love.</quote>
   <p><quote>You mean?</quote>
   <p><quote>Our small hotel,</quote> he quoted softly. <quote>You'll fall in love
with it the way I have, when you see it, Tandy.</quote>
   <p>
   <p><quote>Here we are,</quote> said Granville.
   <p>Tandy took a quick breath. It was perfect. Hardly an hotel at
all really: just a long, low-thatched building, its white-washed walls
stark in the moonlight. Lit up with fairy-lights, it looked like
something out of a dream.
   <p>He slipped his arm round her. <quote>I knew you'd love it, poppet.</quote>
   <p>She went on staring, utterly bewitched. He'd been right. There
was a well, a wishing well, in the front garden. As she watched
she could see a couple standing there, hand in hand, oblivious to
everything but themselves.
   <p><quote>Oh, Granville, it's just what I dreamed of,</quote> Tandy said in a
whisper.
   <p>Granville smiled gently. This was the way to do it...
   <p><quote>That's what you call a preview, Tandy darling.</quote> He backed
the car out again and drove back swiftly in the direction of the city.
He could see the way she kept glancing at him, and he knew exactly
what was in her mind. She wanted him to stop the car, to make love to
her. He turned down a small lane, and slowed to a stop.
   <p><quote>You're very silent, Tandy,</quote> he said lightly.
   <p><quote>Am I?</quote>
   <p><quote>You are. And I'm glad. I hate women who chatter the whole
time.</quote>
   <p><quote>Granville &mdash; Granville darling &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He put his arm round her, drew her towards him. <quote>I love
you...</quote>
   <p><quote>And I love you, Granville, I love you.</quote> The words came out
with a fire that almost frightened her. Her very feelings were
frightening her now. She'd had no idea, until this moment, just how
desperately disturbing love could be...
   <p>His lips came down hard on hers and she clung to him.
   <p><quote>Granville &mdash; darling &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>My love &mdash;</quote>
   <p>At last, she struggled free from his arms.
   <p><quote>Well, Tandy,</quote> he said, <quote>you've seen our hotel. You know
it's waiting for us. When is it to be?</quote>
   <p><quote>Granville!</quote> Suddenly now everything was right and wonderful
and not a bit frightening any more. <quote>Granville darling, not just for
a little while. I mean, you see, I must wait until Jock and Marion
are married. I don't think that'll be long now. They've found each
other and they want to be together always. But &mdash; but once they're
married, then you and I. Oh, Granville, say it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Say what, my sweet?</quote>
   <p><quote>Say &mdash; I love you, Tandy. I want you to marry me &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Abruptly he drew his arm from her shoulders. Abruptly he
switched on the car ignition. <quote>Another of them!</quote>
   <p>His tone was like a lash. But what had she done?
   <p><quote>Another of what?</quote>
   <p>Over the purr of the car engine, his voice came to her: <quote>You're
like the rest of them, Tandy! I just can't believe that.</quote> He put
the car into gear, put his foot down. In silence they drove back into
the city. He said no more until they had stopped right outside the
flat.
   <p><quote>Well, Tandy?</quote>
   <p><quote>You're angry with me, Granville. Why? What have I done?</quote>
   <p><quote>Done? Nothing I suppose. It's just that I'm disappointed. I
thought you were different. Like me. Honest. Straight.</quote>
   <p><quote>What on earth do you mean?</quote>
   <p><quote>How I hate and despise the kind of woman who will only settle
for a wedding ring, Tandy. Marriage is something foisted on us by
people who like the idea of living in cages because they're too scared
of freedom.</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't understand,</quote> her voice trembled. <quote>Loving people,
Granville, means you want to be with them always &mdash; and that's why
people get married, surely, so that they can be together always.</quote>
   <p><quote>And you think a few mumbled words in front of the Registrar and

<head>SHORT STORY by MARTIN MAYCOCK</head>
<head>He wondered throughout the long dark hours he spent...</head>
<head>WAITING FOR STEPHEN</head>
<head>...what had come between him and his son</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY MONICA GILL</head>
   <p>THAT Saturday, Stephen was due home from the church hall
before five. His father, who was hard at work at his desk, didn't
notice the time passing and it was well past six when he looked at the
clock.
   <p>He thumped his papers into a tidy shape, lit his last cigarette,
and went out on to the landing.
   <p><quote>Stephen. Are you back, Stephen?</quote> His voice sounded through
the house. But there was no reply.
   <p>Alan was puzzled. He came down the stairs rather quickly, looked
into the living-room and the dining-room, and then walked out through
the kitchen into the garden. There was no one there, but Alan stood,
for a moment, on the edge of the lawn, enjoying the warm evening.
There was no wind; the oak tree on the allotments behind the house
was standing absolutely still. It was perfect for cricket. If
Stephen had been back from the rehearsal on time they could have had a
spot of practice...
   <p>
   <p>ALAN mooned across the grass, feeling vaguely let down. If
Mary had been home, they would have been going to the Swansons' dinner
party. That was out, and now no cricket. Alan went inside again and
stood by the bay window in the front room. Except for George Sheriff,
clipping his hedge, the road was empty. Alan stood there, looking
out, his fingers drumming lightly on the sill.
   <p>His fingers stopped drumming. A small boy in a blue blazer was
walking along the pavement. He came about a quarter of the way along
the road, and then turned in at a white gate.
   <p>Alan went out by the front door, hurrying towards the white gate.
The boy in the blazer answered the door when he knocked. Alan knew
him; he was in Stephen's class.
   <p><quote>Gerald,</quote> he said. <quote>Stephen's not home yet from the
rehearsal. What time did you finish?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not till five. I've been around at John Purdy's since.</quote>
   <p>Alan looked at his watch. It was now ten past seven. He said:
<quote>I suppose you didn't see who Stephen left with?</quote>
   <p>Gerald shook his head doubtfully. <quote>I didn't see him go.</quote> He
paused. <quote>I think he left earlier.</quote> He started swinging the front
door nervously.
   <p><quote>Why did he leave earlier, Gerald?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>GERALD was silent for a moment, then, still swinging the
door, he said: <quote>He thought they were laughing at him.</quote>
   <p><quote>Laughing at him?</quote>
   <p><quote>When he recited his poem they were laughing at the back because
Anderson tore his trousers on a nail. Stephen stopped saying his
poem. Mr. Field told him to go on, but he just stood there. And
then he walked off the stage. He went out by the side door and I
didn't see him again.</quote>
   <p><quote>Any idea where I might find him?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, no... not unless he's round at Cobbold's.</quote>
   <p><quote>Cobbold's.</quote> Alan repeated the name. He said nothing. Then:
<quote>Where does he live?</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm not sure. Somewhere the other side of the church.</quote>
   <p>It took Alan some time to get across to the church. He walked
round to the porch and pushed through the inner door. There was no
one inside, but the vestry door was open. Alan crossed the nave,
knocked on the open door and looked in. Field was working at some
papers. He was old for a curate. Fortyish. Alan's age.
   <p>Alan explained about Stephen being late and Field said he hadn't
realised that Stephen had left before the others.
   <p><quote>He muffed some of his lines this afternoon, Mr. Deane. That
probably upset him a bit. But don't worry. <quote>He'll be back for
supper.</quote>
   <p><quote>I hope so,</quote> Alan said. <quote>Mary's visiting her sister. If
Stephen's not home when she gets back I just don't know what she'll
do.</quote>
   <p>For a while it was quiet in the room. Then Alan asked Field if
he knew where a boy named Cobbold lived. Field delved into a card
index and came up with the address.
   <p>
   <p>HE wrote it on a slip of paper. <quote>Is young Cobbold a
friend of your lad then?</quote>
   <p>Alan shrugged. <quote>If it's the boy I'm thinking of, Stephen
brought him round once. Just the once. I had to put my foot down
there.</quote> He turned to go. <quote>Mr. Deane.</quote>
   <p>Alan turned.
   <p><quote>Mr. Deane, why did Stephen decide to take part in the
concert? He doesn't really like that sort of thing, you know.</quote>
   <p>Alan did not reply at once. At last he said: <quote>Some people
leave it to others, Mr. Field. And some people get down to the job
themselves. I've always buckled down to it.</quote>
   <p><quote>And Stephen, he feels the same?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>ALAN nodded. <quote>I believe in training,</quote> he said, and
moved away across the nave. He was back at the porch when he heard a
step behind him. It was Field again.
   <p><quote>You go down to this Cobbold boy,</quote> he said. <quote>I'll make a few
calls, and meet you back at your house. If I find Stephen, I'll bring
him straight home.</quote>
   <p>There was no front gate to Cobbold's house. A small van, rather
dilapidated, stood on the grassy gravel drive. Cobbold's mother
answered the door. She smiled at Alan rather vaguely and sent him
round to the back. Cobbold was there, feeding some small animals in a
hutch.
   <p>He was the boy Alan remembered: thick glasses, and rather weedy.
None too clean. He had wanted to drag Stephen off somewhere with his
elder brother after dark. To photograph bats, or something equally
ludicrous. Quite an unsuitable type of boy.
   <p>Alan didn't refer to their previous meeting. <quote>I'm Stephen
Deane's father,</quote> he said. <quote>Do you happen to know where he is?</quote>
   <p>The boy shook his head. <quote>He hasn't been round today, Mr.
Deane. Isn't there a concert or something up at St. Mary's?</quote>
   <p>Alan nodded.
   <p>Cobbold seemed to find it difficult to express himself clearly.
<quote>Is Stephen lost then?</quote> he said. <quote>Do you want me to find him for
you?</quote>
   <p><quote>No. No, thank you,</quote> Alan said rather sharply. <quote>If he
should call in, tell him to go home at once, will you?</quote>
   <p>Stephen still wasn't back when he got home. It was dark now
indoors. Alan switched on the light in the hall. Then he switched on
the kitchen light, filled the kettle and set it on the gas. He walked
into the dining-room and switched the light on there, too.
   <p>Out in the hall someone was tapping the door-knocker softly.
Alan went to see who it was. It was Field.
   <p><quote>Home yet?</quote> Field asked.
   <p>Alan shook his head.
   <p><quote>Well, I've no news of him, I'm afraid,</quote> Field said. <quote>No
news is good news, of course. I called at the police station.
They've had no accidents reported.</quote>
   <p><quote>Would you like a cup of tea?</quote> Alan asked. They went into the
kitchen.
   <p><quote>I insisted that he should take part in the concert,</quote> Alan
said.
   <p>Field looked at him across the rim of his teacup.
   <p><quote>Shouldn't I have?</quote> Alan asked. <quote>I want him to pull his
weight. The concert's for the parish development fund.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a good cause,</quote> Field said briefly.
   <p>
   <p>THEY finished the tea and then Alan started ringing people
up. At half-past nine, in an interval between calls, the telephone
rang. It was the police station. A voice wanted to know if Stephen
was home yet. When Alan said he wasn't, the voice said a car was
coming round.
   <p>The police car seemed to arrive almost at once. When Alan went
to the door there were two men on his step, both in plain clothes.
Alan took them into the living-room; he felt suddenly cold and
switched on the electric fire. The older man, who was a sergeant, sat
down on the sofa. Alan told him how Stephen was said to have walked
out of the concert rehearsal and hadn't been seen since. He explained
that his wife was away visiting her sister.
   <p>The sergeant had a notebook on his knee. He asked for the full
name of the boy. Stephen Roger Kearsley Deane. Age? Ten
years. Description? The sergeant's notes soon filled a page of his
book. He turned over on to a clean page, and asked for the names of
boys that Stephen knew. When Alan thought about it, it seemed that
Stephen had no very close friends. <quote>He's rather a shy boy, you
see,</quote> he said.
   <p>The sergeant finished writing. He looked up. <quote>You've not told
your wife yet?</quote> He gestured at the phone.
   <p><quote>Not yet.</quote>
   <p><quote>Are things normally a little difficult between you and the boy?
Don't mind me asking this, Mr. Deane. It might help us. From
what's been said I gather that he wasn't very keen on being in this
concert at all. Do you often have rows over things like this?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>HE stared at the sergeant. <quote>There was no row. There are
never any rows. We don't brawl in this house.</quote>
   <p><quote>Trouble between you and your wife?</quote> There was no shade of
expression on the sergeant's heavy face. <quote>Anything that might worry
the boy?</quote>
   <p>There was a momentary pause.
   <p><quote>No. Nothing.</quote>
   <p>Field left about ten minutes after the two detectives. Alan went
with him to the gate. As Field drew away on his motorcycle Alan
noticed a knot of men under the street lamp across the road. One of
the men broke away and came over to Alan. It was Roy Fox, father of
the boy, Gerald.
   <p><quote>We are going out round the streets,</quote> Fox said. <quote>They're
parcelling them out now. We're going in twos.</quote>
   <p><quote>I ought to come with you,</quote> Alan said. <quote>But the police said
to stay here for Mary.</quote>
   <p>Fox was a tall, thin man with a big ginger R.A.F. moustache.
He gripped Alan's hand. Then he went back to the group under the
lamppost.
   <p>Alan went indoors. Upstairs in his bedroom he put on a thick
blue jersey under his sports coat. In the kitchen again, he looked
for his torch but could not find it.
   <p>Mary arrived home by taxi.
   <p><quote>Stephen's not come home,</quote> Alan said, pushing the door closed
behind her.
   <p>Mary sat down on the stairs. <quote>Where is he then?</quote> she said.
Her face seemed very pale in the weak light of the hall. Alan told
her how things were.
   <p><quote>Who have you checked with? The Bruces? The Smails? The
Willoughbys? The Cartwrights?</quote>
   <p>At each name Alan nodded. <quote>I phoned them. And the police are
going round.</quote> He explained about the detectives.
   <p><quote>David Forrest's mother?</quote>
   <p><quote>Field saw her. Field from the church. But none of them would
have kept him until now.</quote>
   <p>Still in her coat, Mary stood up and went into the living-room to
the telephone. Most of the people she rang had been checked already
but Alan let her do it. At last she put the phone down, went over to
the sofa and sat there hugging her coat around her.
   <p><quote>Would you like a cup of tea?</quote> Alan asked.
   <p>Mary said nothing.
   <p><quote>They seem to think he was upset at being in the concert,</quote>
Alan said. <quote>Perhaps I shouldn't have put him in for it. But he's
got to learn to mix and to do his whack.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why?</quote> Mary said. <quote>I'm not a good mixer. Some people
aren't.</quote> She had been looking intently at her hands. Now she
raised her head and looked into Alan's eyes. <quote>Sometimes you are
disappointed in me, aren't you &mdash; because I don't join in with this and
that? I think you love me, but sometimes you are disappointed.
   <p><quote>And what you don't like to say to me, you say to Stephen, don't
you? You're worried in case he grows up like his mother.</quote>
   <p>Alan said: <quote>I want to do my best for the boy.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's not good enough. Your best doesn't matter. It's
his best that is important. He has to be himself, Alan. Make his
own choices. Look how he wanted a kitten for his birthday, and you
gave him football boots.

<head>The Doctor's Daughters</head>
<head>by ANNE WEALE</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY DENIS ALFORD</head>
   <p>It was like a pebble thrown into a quiet, still pool when
Daniel Elliot met the doctor's daughters!
<head>THE STORY SO FAR</head>
   <p>For three years after the death of Sir Robert Elliot, Branford
Hall lay empty and the overgrown grounds became a favourite haunt of
RACHEL BURNEY, eldest of the local doctor's three daughters.
Rachel had kept house for her widowed father, her younger sisters,
CAROLA and SUZY, and their fluttery aunt, RACHEL BURNEY,
ever since leaving art school some years previously.
   <p>One sunny May morning Rachel woke from a daydream in the Branford
orchard &mdash; she had been wondering whether she would ever marry EDWARD
FORRESTER whom she had known since childhood &mdash; to find herself being
scrutinised by a tall, bronzed man. In her consternation and not
realising he was Sir Robert's Canadian grandson, DANIEL ELLIOT,
she accused him of trespassing!
   <p>Later, listening to the Canadian's sarcastic comments as she
accompanied him through the dusty, neglected rooms of the Hall, Rachel
became convinced he was the most provoking, arrogant man she had ever
met...
   <p>At tea she was filled with dismay when DOCTOR BURNEY suddenly
announced that he had invited the new owner of the Hall to dinner that
evening.
   <p>Twenty-year-old Carola, the beauty of the family, returned home
delighted because she had been appointed house model of the store
where she worked. Tubby, fourteen-year-old Suzy was frankly envious.
   <p>Promptly at six-thirty there was a knock on the front door.
Rachel opened it &mdash; and was struck dumb. Gone was the casually
dressed Canadian she had thought a <quote>backwoodsman</quote> &mdash; this Daniel
Elliot was immaculately tailored...
   <p>The story now continues
   <p>
   <p>ALTHOUGH Rachel had spent most of her life in a
neighbourhood where even rich people wore ancient tweeds and faded
raincoats, she could not fail to recognise the faultless cut of the
lounge suit which now replaced the disreputable slacks Daniel Elliot
had worn earlier that day. She knew, too, that the immaculate cream
silk shirt and olive green gum-twill tie must have been bought at some
very expensive shirtmakers.
   <p>Perching on the edge of the sofa, she tried vainly to think of
something to say and was relieved when the visitor broke the silence
by asking permission to smoke.
   <p><quote>Oh, yes, please do,</quote> she said hastily, looking about for the
ivory cigarette box that her father &mdash; himself a pipe-smoker &mdash; kept for
guests.
   <p>But before she could discover where it had been moved, Elliot
produced a slim silver case and offered it.
   <p><quote>N-no, thank you.</quote> The foolish stammer made her even more
self-conscious. <quote>My father says you are staying at the Saracen,
Mr. Elliot. Is it comfortable? The couple who run it now have only
been there a short time. The hotel side is quite new.</quote>
   <p>He was flicking his black enamelled lighter and she noticed that
his hands, mahogany dark against the pale cream cuffs of his shirt,
were clinically clean, the nails pared short at the tips of his long
lean fingers. His cuff-links were plain gold rectangles and he did
not wear a signet ring.
   <p><quote>Yes, extremely comfortable, thanks,</quote> he answered quietly.
<quote>My room overlooks the village green. I am told that the stream
running through the centre of it has quite a history.</quote>
   <p><quote>The Goose Beck? Yes, it has. People used to do all their
washing in it years ago. It widens into a pool up near the church.
That's where they ducked witches in the Middle Ages.</quote>
   <p>He drank some sherry, his eyes disconcertingly keen as he watched
her.
   <p><quote>I imagine you were not very pleased to hear I was coming
tonight,</quote> he remarked bluntly.
   <p>Rachel swallowed, unable to meet his glance.
   <p><quote>I think I should apologise for saying what I did to you this
morning,</quote> she said, flushing. <quote>It was very rude of me.</quote>
   <p><quote>On the contrary, I found it refreshingly frank. You look very
attractive when you are angry,</quote> he added, with a hint of mockery.
Then, glancing round the room: <quote>Where is the Hound of the
Baskervilles tonight?</quote>
   <p>She stiffened.
   <p><quote>Bolster is in the garden,</quote> she said coolly, furious that the
lazy, almost caressing note in his voice had succeeded in heightening
her colour.
   <p><quote>You know, I am beginning &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He broke off, rising to his feet as Miss Burney and Suzy entered.
   <p>Rachel made the introductions and left her aunt to take over the
conversation. She was pouring a sherry for Aunt Florence when the
door swung open and Carola made one of her grand entrances.
   <p>After contributing a couple of pounds to the family exchequer &mdash;
some of which she invariably borrowed back before the end of the
week &mdash; Carola spent all her earnings on clothes and cosmetics. Every
Friday saw some addition to her wardrobe. If no dress, shoes, or
handbag had appealed to her, then she would buy jewellery, make-up or
nylons. To be up to the minute was as essential to Carola as eating
or sleeping. She pored over fashion magazines with the same
professional absorption that her father gave to his medical journals
or Miss Burney to horoscopes.
   <p>Tonight she was wearing her latest acquisition, a dress of misty
blue-green chiffon with a sleeveless bloused bodice and a flurry of
pleats from the waist. Her eyelids shimmered with silvery aquamarine
shadow and her lipstick was a subtle amber-rose. She looked willowy
and fragile and a delicious scent wafted from her as she moved.
   <p>
   <p>ELLIOT stood up, his eyebrows tilting appreciatively.
   <p>A little put out by the interruption, Miss Burney said:
   <p><quote>This is Carola, my second niece, Mr. Elliot.</quote>
   <p>Carola smiled and held out a small cool hand, her silver
bracelets tinkling.
   <p><quote>How do you do? Welcome to England, Mr. Elliot,</quote> she said
charmingly. Then, with mischievous candour: <quote>I must say you are not
a bit what we expected.</quote>
   <p>He laughed.
   <p><quote>What did you expect?</quote>
   <p>Carola sank gracefully into a chair and crossed her legs,
revealing so much knee that Aunt Florence, who disapproved of recent
fashion trends, made anxious signals to her to pull her skirt down.
   <p><quote>We weren't really expecting anyone at all after so long,</quote>
Carola said, ignoring the signs. <quote>But you are not at all like your
grandfather. He used to stump round the village with an enormous
stick and growl at people through his moustache.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm sure he never growled at you.</quote>
   <p>Daniel looked amused.
   <p><quote>Oh, yes, he did. I was terrified of him.</quote>
   <p>She gave a reminiscent shiver. Then, twirling imaginary
whiskers, she did a very creditable imitation of Sir Robert's deep
bass voice.
   <p><quote>Really, Carola! I am surprised at you!</quote> Miss Burney
protested indignantly, her long thin nose turning pink with
mortification at this irreverent piece of mimicry. She looked
apologetically at their guest. <quote>Your grandfather was a most charming
old gentleman, Mr. Elliot, and greatly respected,</quote> she assured him
earnestly.
   <p><quote>I dare say he was milder than he looked,</quote> he said carelessly.
<quote>I believe he made several attempts to patch things up with my
father but none of them was successful.</quote>
   <p><quote>What did they have a row about?</quote> Carola asked. <quote>Everyone
knows there was a colossal bust-up, but no one knows why.</quote>
   <p>Before Elliot could reply, Doctor Burney came in and Rachel
slipped away to put the finishing touches to the supper table. She
took little part in the conversation during the meal, in the course of
which it emerged that Daniel Elliot could pilot a plane, had travelled
all over the world and had an informed taste in art, literature and
music.
   <p>By the time they had reached the coffee stage, it was sickeningly
clear to Rachel that, far from being an uncouth product of the
backwoods as she had supposed &mdash; and perhaps indicated by her manner to
him &mdash; Daniel Elliot knew ten times more of the world than anyone she
had met.
   <p><quote>May I give you a hand with the washing up?</quote> he asked her, as
they rose to return to the sitting-room.
   <p><quote>Thank you, but I would really rather do it myself,</quote> she said
politely.
   <p><quote>Rachel is the madly domesticated type. You would probably put
everything back in the wrong place and then she would have to
re-organise them. You hate things to be out of order, don't you,
sweetie?</quote> Carola said teasingly.
   <p>Rachel smiled, wondering why a passion for tidiness always
sounded such a petty, old-maidish foible.
   <p><quote>I do a bit,</quote> she admitted evenly. <quote>I'll make some more
coffee. I won't be long.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>SHE had just dried the last plate and was setting clean
coffee cups on a tray, when a dark-haired, spectacled young man put
his head through the kitchen window.
   <p><quote>Coming for a walk, Rachel?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>Oh, hello, Edward! No, I can't tonight,</quote> she said
regretfully. <quote>We have a visitor. Come in and pay your respects to
the new lord of the manor. He is in the sitting-room with the
others.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I heard the prodigal grandson had finally turned up.</quote>
Edward came into the kitchen. <quote>It's all over the village. What is
he like?</quote>
   <p><quote>Quite pleasant,</quote> Rachel said evasively, going to the pantry
for more milk.
   <p>Edward leaned against the dresser, watching her. He was tall and
lanky, with a thin, clever face and slightly stooped shoulders. As a
small boy he had never fitted into the rowdy gang of village lads and
later, when he went to Branford Grammar School and walked away with
most of the academic laurels, his friends had been similarly quiet and
studious. Oddly, Rachel, then a pigtailed tomboy, had liked him
better than the more boisterous youths.
   <p><quote>I say, Rachel &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He broke off, fiddling with the strap of his wristwatch.
   <p><quote>Mm, what?</quote> she asked, wishing the kettle would hurry up and
boil.
   <p><quote>I rather wanted to see you tonight.</quote>
   <p><quote>You sound very mysterious. What's up?</quote>
   <p>He hesitated.
   <p><quote>Well, for one thing, I've been promoted.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, Edward, how lovely! Congratulations!</quote>
   <p>He flushed.
   <p><quote>It is pretty encouraging and, of course, my income will
improve considerably. That is why I wanted you to be the first to
know.</quote>
   <p>Rachel smiled at him.
   <p><quote>I always knew you would do great things,</quote> she said
affectionately.
   <p>And then, because it seemed the appropriate gesture and because
she had known him for so long, she laid her hands lightly on his
shoulders and reached up to kiss his cheek.
   <p>Edward's reaction was to clasp her eagerly round the waist and
return the kiss so heartily that she was too much taken aback to do
anything but submit. When, after a moment, he released her, she was
too breathless and shaken to free herself and could only stand dazedly
in the circle of his arms, trying to decide whether she had liked it.
   <p><quote>Oh, Rachel, don't you see, I can ask you to marry me now,</quote> he
said huskily. <quote>You do care for me, dearest? You will say
<squote>yes</squote>?</quote>
   <p>Rachel stared at him blankly. She had known for years that
Edward was fond of her and that everyone assumed they would eventually
marry. In a vague, wait-till-it-happens way, she had assumed it
herself. But now that he had actually proposed, she discovered that
she had no notion how to answer him. Although she was twenty-four,
she still thought of marriage as something in the future.
   <p><quote>I don't know, Edward,</quote> she answered lamely. <quote>I'm not sure.
It's all so &mdash; so sudden.</quote>
   <p>And then, as she searched for words to explain that she was
touched and flattered, but that it wasn't a question which could be
settled in a split second, a movement in the doorway caught her eye
and she turned her head, a wave of furious and embarrassed colour
suffusing her face and throat.
   <p>Calmly, his mouth twitching, his eyes brilliant with undisguised
amusement, Daniel Elliot strolled forward.
   <p><quote>I came to carry the tray for you,</quote> he said politely. <quote>I
seem to have chosen an inopportune moment.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>FOR what seemed an eternity, but was actually about fifteen
seconds, there was a strained silence.
   <p>Anyone with a skin thinner than a rhinoceros hide would have
muttered an apology and hastily retreated, Rachel thought furiously.

<text id=LOBP28>
<head>Across the Square</head>
<head>HILTON FRIARS</head>
   <p>TOMMY BLANEY'S nose was pressed flat against the shop window,
his blue eyes gazing seriously through a wisp of fair hair which would
keep falling across his eyes. He pushed his lower lip forward and
blew the strands away again and, at the same time, stood back from the
window and rubbed his hands together happily.
   <p>His sister Margaret would look beautiful in that dress, he
thought wistfully, just like he imagined an angel would look. His
eyes lit up with excitement as he dug his hands deep into the pockets
of his duffle coat. He would buy it for her.
   <p>And then, as the feel of the twopence halfpenny which his fingers
closed upon revealed the cold result of his financial position, his
happy expression faded. He gave a manly little shrug and turned
slowly away.
   <p>How much was it, anyway, he asked himself miserably. A lot more
than he had in his money box. He sidled back to the window and looked
for the price. Fifteen guineas it said, plain as anything &mdash; that was
paper money that was. He stood thoughtfully looking at the dress from
the doorway of the shop.
   <p>
   <p>ON the other side of the square, Michael Price paused in
his dictating and stared absently down through the window of his
office on the first floor of Bank Buildings. Behind him, Stella
Travis, a discontented-looking girl with a notebook balanced on her
lap above shapely crossed legs, looked casually at her long
silver-lacquered finger nails. She was fast coming to the conclusion
that she was wasting her charms on this new boss of hers, who seemed
to look upon her as a mere dictating machine.
   <p>If he didn't get on with this letter she would be late for her
lunch date, and what's more she'd tell him so shortly.
   <p>Michael watched the little figure standing in front of the shop
window and wondered what could possibly be attracting a small boy so
much in a window displaying outfits for a bride and wedding guests.
He remembered that in his own childhood he spent hours looking into a
shop that sold meccano sets, but ladies' shops never had any appeal
for him.
   <p>The child's attitude intrigued him until he just couldn't contain
his curiosity any longer. He turned suddenly. <quote>That's all now, Miss
Travis, thank you &mdash; we'll leave the rest till after lunch,</quote> and
quickly gathering up his hat and gloves, he left the office.
   <p><quote>What's got him?</quote> Miss Travis wondered, her curiosity taking
her to the window. She saw Michael cross the square and stop in front
of the shop window that had attracted Tommy, who had just disappeared
round the corner.
   <p>Michael scrutinised the window display in the hope of discovering
what had so held the child's attention. Surely it couldn't have been
the dresses. What a lovely creation in lace that was in the centre.
He supposed it would be accompanying some lucky fellow down the
church aisle soon.
   <p>A little disappointed at not having his curiosity satisfied, he
turned away and almost collided with Stella Travis.
   <p><quote>Pretty, isn't it?</quote> she purred, as he raised his hat in some
embarrassment. <quote>Some lucky girl,</quote> she pouted, and looked at him
coyly.
   <p><quote>Er-er-yes. I was just admiring the lace &mdash; quite a change
from the usual woollens we see at the office,</quote> he stammered
clumsily. Why did Miss Travis always make him feel such an idiot &mdash;
she was so poised and self-assured.
   <p>She made no attempt to move away and he said firmly, <quote>Well, I
mustn't keep you from your lunch,</quote> and quickly left her. Stella
Travis was, however, far too thick-skinned to take that as a rebuff.
   <p>
   <p>THE next day as Michael sat in his office his mind wandered
to that earnest little boy he had seen across the square the previous
day. The ordeal of dictation with Miss Travis was over for the
morning, thank goodness. Yesterday's encounter outside the shop
seemed to have given her ideas and she had been casting coy glances at
him all the morning.
   <p>It was no good. He would have to get her transferred. She was
far too much of an embarrassment for him. He would speak to the
secretary about it.
   <p>He went to the window and immediately forgot his problem typist
when he saw the little boy outside the shop again.
   <p>Tommy bent to take a ruler from the top of his stocking, held it
at arm's length and surveyed the length of it. Then, with one eye
closed, he tried to measure how many times it would go into the length
of the bride's dress. He did this several times, much to the
amusement of passers by, of whom Tommy was quite oblivious.
   <p>Michael's eyes softened as he recalled his own childhood. He had
good reason to be grateful to St. Edward's Orphanage for the
opportunities which they had made available to him and which
consequently led to the good position he now held in his firm. Little
boys, therefore, always had a very special interest for him. He was
out of his office and across the road at Tommy's side in next to no
time at all.
   <p>
   <p>TOMMY was far too busy with his measuring to notice
Michael, who couldn't help smiling at his serious little face.
   <p>He put an arm gently on Tommy's shoulder. <quote>Who's the lucky
girl?</quote> he asked seriously.
   <p>Tommy answered excitedly, <quote>My sister Margaret... I've
measured &mdash; it's just right for her &mdash; it's as long as her nighty</quote>.
Michael stifled a laugh and adopted a man-to-man attitude.
   <p><quote>Does your sister want that dress?</quote>
   <p><quote>She'd look beautiful in it,</squote> Tommy said dreamily.
   <p>Michael tried again. <quote>Is she getting married?</quote>
   <p><quote>She will be soon, and I want her to have that lovely dress.
It's just like the one she told my little sister and me about in a
story where the prince came from far, far away on a big ship.
Margaret said she would like a dress like that when she married her
prince. My sister's the best sister in the world,</quote> he finished
proudly, putting the ruler back in his stocking.
   <p><quote>Have you any money?</quote> Michael asked him.
   <p><quote>How much is fifteen guineas really? I've got 12s. 7 1/2d.
in my money box and I've got a super butterfly collection I could
sell. My dad said it was worth a lot of money.</quote>
   <p><quote>Wouldn't your dad buy the dress for Margaret?</quote> Michael asked
helpfully.
   <p><quote>We haven't got a dad &mdash; or a mum, now, mister. They got burned
when our house caught fire,</quote> he said, almost without expression.
<quote>That's why I want to get the dress for Margaret &mdash; she looks after
Tina and me, and she's beautiful and kind</quote>.
   <p>Tommy looked at the clock in the nearby church. <quote>Ooh, it's
late &mdash; I'll have to be going home for my dinner or I'll be late back
for school</quote>.
   <p>
   <p>MICHAEL was too interested now to leave Tommy. <quote>I'm going
your way</quote>. He took Tommy's direction. <quote>I'll see you across the
road... Where is your school?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>In Bridge Street</quote>. Tommy indicated the direction with a nod.
<quote>Just behind the station</quote>. Michael remembered seeing a small
school near several rows of houses. He supposed it was probably the
only school in the centre of the city.
   <p>Tommy pointed to a tall, important-looking building rising high
above the other blocks of buildings. <quote>See right at the top, mister,
where the curtains are &mdash; that's where we live. My Grandpa is the
caretaker and Margaret and Tina and me came to live there after our
house got burned. Margaret helps Grandpa now 'cos Grandma's ill but
she's going to get a job soon</quote>.
   <p>He paused to consider and then chatted on. <quote>It's nice living
high up &mdash; you can see all over the town, and we can hear the big burr
of the Town Hall clock when it's going to strike</quote>. He burred
several times in demonstration.
   <p>Michael thought how quiet and lonely it must be at night living
at the top of one of these buildings, when all the office workers had
left the city and were spending their leisure hours at home in the
suburbs.
   <p><quote>How does it feel going to bed so high up?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, it's nice...</quote> Tommy smiled up at Michael. <quote>Every night
Tina and me sit by the window looking down on all the twinkling lights
while Margaret tells us a story. It's quiet and beautiful, Mister</quote>.
   <p><quote>Just like being on a ship at night, I expect,</quote> Michael said,
<quote>with the twinkling stars to light up the dark sky</quote>.
   <p>Tommy's eyes shone. <quote>Have you been on a ship then?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I sailed back from South Africa a few months ago</quote>.
Tommy showed his admiration.
   <p><quote>You would love to see the animals in the Game Preserve there, I
know</quote>.
   <p><quote>Sounds smashing</quote>.
   <p>They turned a corner and Tommy pointed to an imposing looking
entrance across the road. <quote>That's where we live,</quote> he said, and
turned to wave goodbye as he crossed into the roadway.
   <p>There was a screeching of brakes and a shout and Michael was just
in time to snatch a white-faced Tommy back on to the pavement, the car
just grazing his leg.
   <p><quote>Are you all right?</quote> Michael's face was full of anxiety for
the frightened child. The colour had drained from his face. Michael
gently steered him across the road. <quote>I'll take you home,</quote> he
comforted.
   <p>Tommy had obviously had a nasty shock and Michael was just
wondering what to do with him when a young girl came hurrying down the
steps, her face flushed and her fair curls bobbing as she ran.
   <p>Tenderly she placed her arms round Tommy. <quote>Oh, poor Tommy, are
you hurt, are you hurt?</quote> she cried. <quote>You didn't look both ways
before crossing the road like you promised. I saw you through the
window</quote>.
   <p>All her thoughts were for Tommy as she looked him over for hurts,
and comforted him with loving words. <quote>Oh, Tommy, nothing must happen
to you,</quote> she whispered as she clutched him to her, quite oblivious
of Michael.
   <p>She's little more than a child herself, Michael thought, and
couldn't help staring. Her dark eyelashes lay damp and shining on her
cheeks. She smiled then and opened her eyes &mdash; blue as the sea on a
cloudless day. <quote>Come along, Tommy,</quote> she said, <quote>Come and show
Grandpa you're all right.</quote>
   <p>It was then that she noticed Michael. <quote>Oh, I'm so rude. I
thought only of Tommy. Thank you for saving him from a nasty
accident,</quote> she said shyly, her eyes full of gratitude. Her arm
round Tommy, they went up the steps together. Michael stood for a
moment feeling useless and very much the passer-by.
   <p>The warmth and affection showered on young Tommy by the girl, who
was obviously sister Margaret, brought home to Michael the absence of
family affection in his childhood. He thoughtfully walked away.
   <p>
   <p>MICHAEL looked out of his office window very often after
that and wondered whether he would see Tommy again, but several days
went by without even a glimpse of him. Miss Travis constantly
followed Michael's gaze and once she asked him if he was looking for
anyone special.
   <p>She knew now that she was being moved to another department, and
as she did not seem to be making any headway personally with Michael
she didn't mind, in fact the sooner the better and more luck next time
was her motto. She had been told she would not be transferred until
they got someone to take her place.
   <p><quote>I see that dress has gone from the window over the way,</quote> she
remarked pointedly, <quote>the lace wedding gown, I mean... the one you
were looking at a few days ago...</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh that &mdash; I expect you'll be thinking of having one like
that,</quote> he said, with an attempt at laughing it off. He found it
easier to evade her advances now that he knew that she was being
transferred. <quote>One of your many young men will be sweeping you off
your feet, one of these days,</quote> he went on provocatively, <quote>Better
mind your step</quote>.

<text id=LOBP29>
<head>A GIRL ON HER OWN</head>
   <p><quote>QUEEN STREET at last,</quote> sighed the plump woman as the
train slackened speed. <quote>What a time it's taken to reach Glasgow!</quote>
   <p>Morag Baxter gave her a surprised smile. She had not found the
journey from Oban long or tedious. There had been so much to see. So
much to think about. She had scarcely glanced at the magazines she
had bought.
   <p>Morag looked eagerly out of the window as the train drew into the
station. She was excited but tried not to show it. After ten years,
nearly half her lifetime, she was back in Glasgow. In a way she was
returning home.
   <p>No one would ever have taken Morag Baxter for a Glaswegian.
There was a fresh country bloom in her cheeks and she spoke with an
attractive Highland lilt. But for all that she felt she truly
belonged to this great sprawling city.
   <p>As an orphaned ward of Glasgow Corporation, she had spent the
first eleven years of her life in the city. But Beechwood Children's
Home, which had run on oiled wheels under Miss Simpson's motherly
guidance, seemed like a dream now.
   <p>Infinitely more real were the years she had spent in the north,
eight of them boarding out on the Robertsons' farm and the last two
living in digs in Oban.
   <p>Morag's eyes clouded as she thought about these past two years.
Nothing had been the same since Mrs Robertson died. Though time
had softened Morag's grief, it had not helped her overcome the strange
emptiness in her heart. It was as if her roots had been cut off.
   <p>Although she had a good job, she felt Oban held nothing for her.
It wasn't long before she began to think about Glasgow with a certain
longing. After all, that was where she really belonged.
   <p>So this year she had decided to spend her fortnight's holiday in
the city.
   <p>Miss Simpson, now retired from her post at Beechwood Home, had
fixed up accommodation and promised to meet her at the station when
she arrived. Everything was arranged.
   <p>As the train jerked to a halt and she joined the throng of
passengers on the platform, Morag felt a thrill of anticipation. She
had saved up for a long time for this holiday and she meant to enjoy
every minute of it.
   <p><quote>Morag, my dear!</quote> Miss Simpson, white-haired now and trim in
silver-grey, met her at the barrier. <quote>How nice you're looking! And
so grown-up!</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a while since you saw me last,</quote> the girl reminded her
smilingly.
   <p><quote>Almost two years.</quote> Miss Simpson laid her hand lightly on
Morag's arm to guide her from the station. <quote>Come along and we'll
have a cup of tea before I take you to Grove House and hand you over
to Miss Whelan.</quote>
   <p><quote>Hand me over?</quote> Morag was faintly alarmed. <quote>Is it a
hostel?</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course not!</quote> The older woman's eyes were twinkling.
<quote>Grove House is an excellent hotel for young business women. Miss
Whelan's an old friend of mine, so I've asked her to keep an eye on
you.</quote> She sighed as they paused at the kerb. <quote>If only you could
have come earlier I could have put you up at my flat. As it is, the
removal men are coming on Monday and my sister expects me at
Girvan.</quote>
   <p>Over tea in Fuller's Morag talked gaily about her plans. Miss
Simpson smiled at her enthusiasm. It was a pleasure to meet her
one-time charge again. She was only sorry she would not see more of
her on this visit.
   <p>Time passed so quickly. She could hardly believe it was
twenty-one years since Morag had been placed in her charge at
Beechwood Home. Only five months old, and tragically bereft of both
parents. Although extensive inquiries were made at the time no trace
was found of any relatives.
   <p>Miss Simpson had taken the child to her heart. She had watched
her grow into a likeable, happy little girl. It had been like losing
someone of her own when the Welfare Committee decided to board Morag
out with foster-parents in the north.
   <p>It had all been for the best, of course. A home where she could
become one of the family was better than the best institution.
   <p>Mrs Robertson already had two orphaned children in her care at
Balamore Farm, near Oban, and Morag made a welcome addition to the
family. She had settled down happily at the farm. Her schooling
over, she found a job in an Oban shop.
   <p>Later, when Mrs Robertson felt less able to cope with three
charges, Alison and Johnny Pedon returned to Glasgow. But Morag chose
to remain in the north.
   <p>She was nineteen when Mrs Robertson died. Miss Simpson had
travelled from Glasgow to talk over her future with Mr Robertson and
the local Welfare Officer. Agreeing that Morag should stay in Oban,
they had found suitable lodgings for her in the town. Mr Robertson
himself was giving up the farm and retiring to a cottage he had bought
in Gairloch.
   <p>It had seemed a wise decision at the time. Morag, bewildered and
unhappy by this sudden change in the even tenor of her life, had
raised no objections. But within the past year Miss Simpson fancied
she detected a restless note in her letters.
   <p>Now Morag had come to Glasgow for a holiday.
   <p>Miss Simpson studied the girl seated across the table from her in
the busy tea room. In the years since they had last met she had grown
into a charming young woman, with attractive, auburn hair and wide,
gold-flecked grey eyes.
   <p><quote>I wish I weren't leaving you here on your own, my dear.</quote>
Miss Simpson sounded anxious. <quote>Won't you be lonely?</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't think so,</quote> Morag replied. <quote>Not more than anywhere
else,</quote> she added after a moment's pause.
   <p>Miss Simpson glanced shrewdly at the girl. So she had been
right. Morag was unhappy in Oban.
   <p><quote>I wrote to Mrs Hendry and she's asked me out to Mosspark,</quote>
Morag went on, clearly trying to change the subject. <quote>Isn't it kind
of her? I &mdash; I'll never forget all she did for me long ago. Then I'd
like to go to all the theatres and look round the shops. I've got
enough money for a completely new outfit and &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>You will need a full purse!</quote> Miss Simpson laughed. <quote>Have a
good time then, dear. If you feel at a loose end after this week, you
can always spend a few days with us at Girvan.</quote>
   <p>It was nearly five o'clock when they arrived at Grove House. It
was a large, rambling building on a corner site in Queen's Drive,
overlooking the park.
   <p>Miss Whelan was a tall, fresh-complexioned woman. There was a
glint of humour in her eyes that seemed to belie her rather forbidding
manner.
   <p><quote>Just in time for tea, Miss Baxter,</quote> she remarked. <quote>We have
it early on Saturdays because the girls are always in a hurry to go
out. Would you like to take your case to your room right away?</quote>
   <p>Morag gave Miss Simpson a parting hug and promised to have lunch
with her at her flat next day. Then she followed the maid upstairs.
   <p>She was delighted with her room, eyeing with approval the
built-in cupboards and the small wash basin that stood in one corner.
The carpet was a delicate shade of blue, and the flowered curtains
matched the bedspread.
   <p>The tea-bell rang before Morag had time to change. She ran a
comb through her hair, applied some fresh lipstick, and went
downstairs. Miss Whelan took her along to the dining-room and
introduced her to a slim, dark-haired girl at a corner table.
   <p><quote>Miss Johnston has been here more than a year now,</quote> she
explained. <quote>She'll soon make you feel at home.</quote>
   <p>Morag smiled hesitantly as she sat down, searching her mind for
some way of starting a conversation. She need not have worried, for
Kathy Johnston was refreshingly free from shyness.
   <p>Within minutes she found out Morag was on holiday and went on to
suggest what she should do and see in town. She broke off as they
were joined by a slightly older girl with fluffy fairish hair and
winged glasses that gave her an attractive, fawn-like appearance.
   <p><quote>This is Jean MacLean,</quote> said Kathy by way of introduction.
<quote>Morag Baxter comes from Oban, Jean. She's only here for a
fortnight and &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Give the poor girl a chance to get a word in!</quote> Jean laughed.
<quote>Hullo, Morag! Nice to meet you!</quote>
   <p>Morag enjoyed the company of these two pleasant, friendly girls.
She learned that Jean worked in a lawyer's office and was engaged to
a young doctor doing his final year in hospital. Kathy Johnston was
training as a junior buyer in Sturrock's, a large department store,
and cheerfully admitted to having several boy friends.
   <p>Both girls belonged out of town and only managed to visit their
families occasionally at week-ends.
   <p>Morag found her own reserve crumbling. Before the meal ended she
had told her new friends a good deal about herself. Kathy's eyes
widened sympathetically and she exchanged a glance with Jean.
   <p><quote>Oban's a lovely place, of course,</quote> she said slowly. <quote>But
don't you find it a bit lonely &mdash; especially in the winter?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I didn't until just lately,</quote> Morag replied, colouring a
little. <quote>And I don't have to stay there, you know.</quote>
   <p>Kathy gave her a questioning glance, but made no comment.
Presently she and Jean took Morag into the lounge and told her about
Grove House.
   <p><quote>It's better than coping on your own in some flatlet,</quote> Jean
said emphatically. <quote>You get decent meals and there are no dishes to
wash afterwards. All you've got to do is pay your dues, keep your
room tidy, and be back indoors at a reasonable hour. I reckon it's
worth it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Miss Whelan's a dear too,</quote> Kathy put in. <quote>Even if she does
like to see all your boy friends!</quote>
   <p>The door opened just then and some of the other residents came
into the lounge. Morag glanced casually at them, then her gaze was
riveted on the last one to enter &mdash; a tall, blonde girl in a black
tailored suit.
   <p>She stared uncertainly for a moment, then almost unbelievingly as
recognition dawned in her eyes.
   <p><quote>Alison!</quote>
   <p>Her exclamation made the other girl turn sharply.
   <p><quote>I &mdash; I've wondered so often if we'd ever meet again,</quote> Morag
went on.
   <p><quote>That's more than I ever did!</quote> Alison Pedon told her,
colouring guiltily as she spoke.
   <p><quote>Do you two know each other?</quote> Kathy asked.
   <p><quote>Oh, yes.</quote> Alison pulled herself together and managed a cool
smile. <quote>We met several years ago when I was staying in Oban. What
on earth are you doing here, Morag?</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm on holiday.</quote>
   <p>Morag was puzzled. Staying in Oban? Why, Alison and her younger
brother, John, had lived with her at the Robertsons' farm for over six
years!
   <p><quote>I see.</quote> Alison shrugged indifferently. <quote>Well, I hope you
enjoy yourself. Now you must excuse me. I'm expecting a phone
call.</quote>
   <p>She turned on her heel and left the room.
   <p>Somewhat disturbed Morag sat down. It was painfully obvious that
her former companion was anything but pleased to see her.
   <p><quote>Strange you should know Alison,</quote> Kathy remarked, breaking the
awkward silence. <quote>I suppose you met her at her folk's hotel in
Oban?</quote>
   <p>Morag swallowed uneasily. Whatever had Alison been telling
everyone? Fortunately Jean hailed a friend at that moment and she was
not called upon to answer Kathy. Then someone switched on the
television and she took the chance to go upstairs to unpack.
   <p>She had only been in her room a few moments when there was a
knock on the door. It was Alison Pedon, her fine eyebrows drawn and
her eyes fixed on Morag accusingly.
   <p><quote>Why did you come here?</quote> she demanded as she brushed past
Morag and came into the room. <quote>To Grove House of all places!</quote>
<head>Bridging The Years</head>
   <p>MORAG shut the door. She had been embarrassed by Alison's
rudeness a short time ago.

<text id=LOBR01>
   <p>Jones, it need hardly be said, stopped that off at once.
   <p>The days have gone when foreigners copied the British.
   <p>With Jones in power, the British are encouraged to copy the
foreigner.
   <p>The foreign-made muck, which British quality goods were supposed
to be pushing out of the market, is now being pushed out of the market
by British-made muck.
   <p>Jones does not believe in quality. He believes in low prices.
He is not interested in the old slogan, ~<quote>British is Best</quote>. He is
interested in the new slogan, ~<quote>Jones is Best</quote>, and the fact that
Jones is British will, he believes, reflect prestige upon Britain. He
is not interested in goods that last a lifetime, a tradition started
by snobbish manufacturers who wanted their children and their
children's children to reap the benefit of their impeccable trading
probity. Jones wishes to reap the benefit himself, in his own
lifetime, and let his brats and brats' brats fend for themselves. To
this end, he is interested in goods that do not last a lifetime, but
which require large replacement orders to be made every five years.
<head>Foreign contacts</head>
   <p>When Jones goes abroad, he does not go as a member of any
group, delegation or coach-party. He goes alone.
   <p>Jones goes alone, secure in the knowledge that wherever he goes,
his arrival will not go unannounced or his stay unnoticed.
   <p>At the hotel, in a capital that he has never visited in his life
before, he will meet an old American friend whom he last met in Paris,
God, it must be years ago, and soon that old American friend is
introducing him to the local Joneses right, left and centre.
   <p>At Harry's Bar, in any foreign city, it turns out that the
particular Harry of the joint used to be the barman of a little club
in London that Jones used to use in the days when Joneses still used
little clubs, and this same Harry gives him the lowdown on where the
native Joneses are currently eating and drinking.
   <p>At the American Express, which is a very Jones place in which to
cash your travellers' cheques, Jones just happens to run into an old
army pal who has now got this amusing job of showing the yobbos around
the night-clubs. The old army pal takes Jones to a number of
night-clubs, most of them specialising in one sexual eccentricity or
another, to which the yobbos would not be admitted, whether with or
without paper hats.
   <p>From the fact that Jones never fails to meet contacts such as
these on his foreign travels, it is obvious that there must be an
International Jones Organisation (Interjones), whose agents disguise
themselves as barmen, old army pals and roving Americans.
   <p>However Interjones may be organised, it is certainly a powerful
and influential body.
   <p>Thanks to Interjones, it is now possible for Jones to travel
throughout the world without losing any of his status, modifying his
standard of living, or, out of sheer loneliness, being compelled to
sit in the reading-room of the British Embassy doing the crossword in
the air-mail edition of The Times.
   <p>Thanks to Interjones, it is possible to cross the Equator
either way without leaving air-conditioning behind. Chains of new
hotels, indistinguishable from one another, have sprung up in the
capitals of the world, and &mdash; without actually being called the
Jones-Plaza or the Jones-Carlton &mdash; they are Jones all right, because
look at the showers, look at the swimming-pool, look at the arcade of
shops, look at the express elevators, look at the six or seven
restaurants, one of them on the roof from which it is possible to get
a panoramic view of London, Beirut, Madrid, Bonn, New Delhi or
Copenhagen, as the case may be.
   <p>Thanks to Interjones, Jones in any foreign city can hire a car,
use a credit card, send a transfer-charge cable, or get a ringside
seat for the student riot in the course of which the British Council
building is burned to the ground.
   <p>Thanks to Interjones, Jones can now travel from airport to
airport, from hotel to hotel, from Harry's Bar to Harry's Bar,
without ever setting foot outside the Jones country.
   <p>Jones ideas are now so firmly established abroad that as
primitive states develop, it is not the Old Country on which they
model themselves, but the New Jones.
   <p>In Africa, Jones hotels spring up even as the Prime Minister
elect is being let out of prison. In the Middle East, oil royalties
are turned into Jones amenities, such as ice, big cars, and
night-clubs that would not be out of place on Miami Beach. In Brazil,
an entirely new capital has been hacked out of the jungle as a living
monument to Jones and all he stands for.
<head>Foreign visitors</head>
   <p>Interjones naturally works on a reciprocal basis, and when
Monsieur Jones, Herr Jones, Signor Jones, Jones Pasha or Don Jones
arrive at the Westbury, whom should they meet in the lobby but
Jones, only this minute back in London himself.
   <p>In this context it is worth noting that, although Interjones
maintains branches in all countries, some nations do not appear to be
signatories to the Interjones Treaty. There are nations which are
exclusively Robinson nations, such as the Dutch, the Bulgarians, and
the Burmese.
   <p>The French are essentially a Jones nation, but like to be
governed by Robinsons. The Germans are essentially a Robinson nation,
but like to be governed by Joneses. The Italians are Jones when
abroad, but Robinson when at home. The Swedes are the Jones-nation
among the Scandinavians, and the Norwegians are the Robinsons.
   <p>England, which bred the first Joneses, is Jones. Wales, from
which the Joneses took their name, is Robinson. Southern Ireland is
Jones. Northern Ireland is Robinson. Scotland is Jones to come south
from, but Robinson to remain in. The Isle of Wight is a compound of
Robinsons.
   <p>Extremely small countries, such as Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, San
Marino, etc., are Robinson to be born in, but Jones to be a foreign
resident of. (This applies particularly to the Channel Islands.)
   <p>The Russians are ideologically Robinson, but throw up
Jones-deviates from time to time. All Iron Curtain countries, except
Czechoslovakia, are statutorily Robinson.
   <p>Iceland is not only Robinson to be born in, Robinson to live in,
Robinson even to have correspondence with, it is also the only country
outside the tourist belt that it is Robinson, and not Jones, to visit.
   <p>Spain is unique, inasmuch as there it is Jones to be a
monarchist, the reason being is that Jones is always on the side of
the future. Portugal is entirely Robinson.
   <p>Switzerland is Robinson to visit, but Jones to bank with. Egypt
is Robinson, but is studying to be Jones. India fought to become
Jones, but did not succeed. South Africa is fighting to remain
Robinson. Australia revels in being Robinson.
   <p>By a trick of light, Canada is Jones when seen from London, but
Robinson when seen from the United States. Within the United States,
it is Robinson to appear like a Jones. In Latin America, Jones and
Robinson live in a constant state of revolt against each other; it is
always possible to know when Jones is revolting against Robinson,
because then we hear about trams being overturned, and Jones detests
trams.
   <p>China, with superhuman effort and against all odds, remains
Robinson. Japan, despite all those paper flowers that blossom in a
jam-jar is becoming Jones.
   <p>The North Pole is Jones. The South Pole is Robinson.
<head>CHAPTER FIVE</head>
<head>TO JONES ACCORDING TO HIS NEEDS</head>
   <p>THE political pundits, the literary weeklies, the more
telegenic Members of Parliament, the leader-writers and the
public-opinion polls &mdash; to say nothing of various summer schools,
conferences, congresses and other centres of political group-therapy &mdash;
have devoted some attention to the question of who will rule Britain
in the future.
   <p>Jones may occasionally join in these discussions if the beer is
good. But for him there is no question to be argued. Jones will rule
Britain in the future.
   <p>Whether Labour or Conservative, the next Government &mdash; or it may
be the next but one &mdash; will be a Government of Joneses.
   <p>What are the facts behind this political reshuffle?
   <p>There is only one fact, and that is that Jones feels unable to
lend his allegiance to any one political party.
   <p>Tory Jones likes the idea of free enterprise, but can't stand the
idea of class privilege.
   <p>Labour Jones likes the idea of equality, but can't stand the idea
of regimentation.
   <p>The Labour Party, as we know, is in decline. What we may not
know is that the Tory Party is also in decline. The Jones Party is
slowly emerging, composed of the Jones-elements from both these
declining bodies.
   <p>Already Jones has established his position in both camps.
There are Labour Joneses and there are Tory Joneses in power today.
(There are no Liberal or Communist Joneses, since Jones is not
interested in causes but in politics.) The Labour Joneses write for
Tory papers. The Tory Joneses write for Socialist papers. The two
Joneses, Labour and Tory, appear on the same television programmes and
unite against trade union Robinsons from the Left Wing and backwoods
Robinsons from the Right Wing.
   <p>Between them, Labour Jones and Tory Jones are forging a new
policy. And that policy will be the Jones Policy for Britain.
<head>Why you should vote for Jones</head>
   <p>At present, Robinson has a clear majority in the House of
Commons. Robinson M.P.s go about on buses, hold dreary clinics
in their constituencies, ask dreary questions about peat, and go on
dreary fact-finding missions to dreary countries on either side of the
Iron Curtain.
   <p>What, in contrast to this, has Jones got to offer? Why will
Jones make a better Member of Parliament than Robinson?
   <p>(a) Jones does not waste time on dreary routine. Everything
he touches he makes exciting, and he is able to create enthusiasm,
which helps the electorate no end.
   <p>(b) Jones is in touch. Where other politicians have to
consult polls, statistics, graphs, fortune-tellers, to find out what
people think, Jones trusts his instinct and is always right.
   <p>(c) Jones lives in the present. He will cheerfully agree
that his party has a shocking record, for his party's past history is
of not the slightest interest to him. Neither does he make sweeping
promises for the vague future. If Jones says he is going to do
something, he means tomorrow.
   <p>(d) Jones has the gift of the gab.
   <p>(e) Jones is a good mixer. It is only on the Jones level
that Tories and Socialists can mix as equals, and consequently he is
able to avoid all those unprofitable stalemates that politicians are
always running into.
   <p>(f) Jones is very good on television.
   <p>(g) Jones is always positive. He would rather be a supporter
than an opposer, and he will always endorse good ideas, whichever side
they come from.
   <p>(h) Jones knows all about images, and in fact invented them.
   <p>(i) Jones is always ready to re-think.
   <p>(j) Jones is very good at inventing slogans. And the slogan
of the Jones Party might well be:
<head>WHAT'S GOOD FOR JONES IS GOOD FOR BRITAIN</head>
<head>The Future Jones Offers You</head>
   <p>The Joneses, Socialist and Tory alike, believe in an
egalitarian society (within the limits of the Jones Practical
Democracy, outlined on pp. 83-87), where the best brains (i.e.
Jones) rise to the top, but where there is wealth and opportunity for
all.
   <p>Jones has no wish for Britain to be a major power, so long as she
can hold first place in the markets of the world.
   <p>He is all for co-existence, peace in our lifetime, and anything
that might come under the heading of progress.
   <p>He is against outmoded traditions, gunboat-diplomacy, and
monopolies.
   <p>He would take the tax off coloured refrigerators.
   <p>Let us examine in detail some of the Jones Policies for Britain:
<head>1. THE JONES FISCAL POLICY</head>
   <p>There will be no significant fall in income tax, since Jones
does not, in fact, object to paying income tax.

<text id=LOBR02>
He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions drawn between
ordinary wage-earners and those self-employed. By the time his
monthly salary arrived, the Inland Revenue had already taken their
share, and there were precious few reductions in tax save for wives,
children, life-insurances or any of the other normal encumbrances
which Cecil had so far avoided. He read the film star's sorry story
and frowned at the provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only
allowed her to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases, but also
postponed demanding the tax until her financial year was ended,
audited and agreed by the Inspector. The process could, and often did
take several years. At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake had
claimed tax relief on the purchase of several mink coats which, it
seemed, were necessary to further her career. Alternatively, it was
reported, she tearfully claimed that the warm coats were heating
appliances and therefore susceptible to a depreciation tax allowance
as plant and machinery. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue wisely
refrained from asking how she paid for the mink coats but demanded a
receipt instead. Between all the interested parties, the final
agreement had been delayed long enough for Miss Cheesecake to spend
all the money which by rights should have been reserved for her tax.
Discounting one chinchilla jacket, a Rolls-Royce and a Sussex manor
house, all three of which were in her husband's name, she now declared
herself bankrupt.
   <p>The train drew into another station and Cecil, with a further six
stops to go, was left almost alone in the coach. He fumed as he
recollected the long correspondence he had had with the Inland Revenue
in an effort to obtain tax relief for a jacket used solely in the
office. <squote>If the jacket is a condition of your employment,</squote> the
Inspector had written, <squote>it may qualify for relief.</squote> Cecil snorted
aloud. So long as he did his job satisfactorily, Frask and Kitsell
Ltd could hardly have cared less if he wore even a bikini in the
office. In fact, the previous summer, his girl comptometer operator
had done so. It led to no end of a muddle with the figures.
   <p>Then there was that long wrangle with the Inland Revenue over
travelling expenses. The journey from Bank to Norbiton took a large
slice out of Cecil's surplus spending power. He had tried to obtain
tax relief for that too, only to be told that journeys from home to
work did not qualify for relief. So Cecil had pursued the matter on
the grounds that he took his work home and, for a week or more, he
took a bundle of record-cards each night in the hope that a passing
Inspector might see it. The final word, as always, came from the
Inland Revenue who fell back once more upon the <squote>condition of
employment</squote> clause.
   <p>Again Cecil glared at Miss Cheesecake who was not only allowed
travelling expenses but was also allowed to buy herself a Rolls-Royce
<squote>on the Tax</squote>. No wonder she could not pay up; one half of her
money seemed to have gone into purchases designed to defray the tax
incurred by the other half which was, in any case, earmarked for
normal living expenses such as publicity parties, beauty treatment and
frequent foreign holidays to the right places.
   <p>The train drew to a halt. Cecil's sole companion, the
parcel-laden housewife, staggered to the door and prepared to alight.
<squote>Madam!</squote> he called after her. <squote>You've left your briefcase.</squote>
His public duty performed, he pointed at the seat opposite without
making any effort to hand it to her.
   <p>The housewife turned a baleful eye and gazed at him over a large
hat-box which, to judge from the Bond Street label, had taken a large
bite out of her husband's taxable income. <squote>It's not mine. I wasn't
sitting there.</squote> She blinked disdainfully at him and stepped out.
   <p>It was a new briefcase, and as the train jogged along the shiny
clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil. He wondered what it contained.
Probably the remains of someone's lunch or a few secret files. He
smiled at his own joke. Of course, it might be holding wads of five
pound notes earned on the black market, if there was still such a
thing as a black market. It might be a shady cash deal though,
specially designed to avoid passing through the books. Perhaps the
case belonged to one of those fellows who were organising those girls
who operated from cars. There could be a lot of money in the
call-girl racket, and not many expenses either, just a telephone, some
wear and tear on the girls and a change of address from time to time.
The briefcase must be crammed with money.
   <p>Cecil realised that four minutes of solitary running time
separated him from the next stop, his home station and, after an
unnecessary glance around, he stepped across the car and tried to open
the briefcase. It was locked. Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
when he shook the case there was a rustling thud of wads of paper.
<squote>Cor!</squote> he muttered aloud, <squote>there's five thousand at least.</squote>
   <p>He felt in his jacket pocket and pulled out a key ring. In
succession he tried his own briefcase key, a suitcase key and a device
designed to lock typewriters. Cecil searched in his pockets once more
and came up with two paper-clips. After a few seconds of twisting, he
roughly thrust a bent wire loop into the lock and waggled it around
vigorously. There was a click and the briefcase opened.
   <p>Cecil thrust an eager hand inside, his fingers groping after wads
of five pound notes. They closed on a single bundle and, fumbling
with nervous excitement, he pulled it out. His eye rested on a wad of
stiff white paper printed on one side. <squote>Old fashioned fivers!</squote> he
muttered again, and tried to recall if they were still legal tender.
Surely the Gov<hi>r</hi>. and Comp<hi>a</hi>. of the Bank of England
would never break their promise to pay on rude demand, let alone on
polite request. Cecil frowned in disappointment as he focussed upon
the printing to find no Gov<hi>r</hi>., no Comp<hi>a</hi>., in fact no
five pound notes at all. He was holding a paper booklet, the top
sheet of which bore, in large Baskerville type, the words
   <p>METROPOLITAN MONOTECHNIC INSTITUTE
   <p>ADVANCED ACCOUNTANCY
   <p>COURSE NO. 3.
   <p>He ruffled the sheets irritably and glowered at his own breach
of social morality. There are few people who would not jump at an
opportunity to rationalise away the theft of a briefcase full of
illicit fivers, but to sell one's soul for a handful of lecture notes
presented quite a different kettle of metaphysics.
   <p>The train slowed down for Norbiton station and Cecil hastily
repacked the briefcase. There was a hiss of opening doors and Cecil
carried his conscience out upon the platform. He climbed the stairs,
eager to unload the guilt-symbol upon the ticket-collector and then to
emerge carrying his shame unseen, but burning, into the night.
   <p>He reached the barrier and fumbled for his contract before
thrusting the briefcase at the ticket-collector with the firm
intention of playing the dutiful citizen retrieving lost property.
Before he could open his mouth, the collector stretched out a hand.
<squote>Watch your step there, sir! Your briefcase is hanging open.
You'll have someone shoving their hot little hands inside. Here,
I'll do it.</squote> The collector pressed the twinkling catch home with a
click.
   <p>Cecil, irretrievably laden with both briefcase and conscience,
stumbled away into the darkness.
<head>2</head>
   <p><squote>HELLO, CECIL. HAD a busy day?</squote> His mother came into the
hall as he opened the front door. He nodded irritably and, turning
his back to her, contrived to slide the briefcase into hiding between
the do-it-yourself cupboard and the polished brass fourteen-pounder
shell-case which served respectively as coat cupboard and umbrella
stand.
   <p><squote>You're later than usual, aren't you?</squote> His mother tidied her
grey hair in the hall-mirror they had once obtained as a free gift in
exchange for the labels from half a hundredweight of Trunk and Greppes
Tannin-free Tea. Cecil shook his head and hung up his raincoat and
hat inside the cupboard. <squote>Aren't you going to say hello?</squote> His
mother stood and faced him with a smile. <squote>I've got some lamb chops
for you this evening.</squote>
   <p><squote>Hello, mother.</squote> He kissed her cheek perfunctorily. <squote>Lamb
chops, indeed. Any letters come?</squote>
   <p>She grimaced. <squote>Only the electric bill. It's up again. We'll
have to go easy on the immersion heater next quarter.</squote>
   <p>Cecil gritted his teeth and glowered at the inequity of Miss
Cheesecake well-nigh bathing in tax-free champagne whilst he had to go
easy on the immersion heater. <squote>What is it, Cecil? Don't you feel
well?</squote> his mother asked solicitously. <squote>You do look tired. Go and
get yourself a drink.</squote>
   <p><squote>Don't fuss, mother! I'm quite well and no more tired than
usual, and we finished the gin last week, you know that.</squote> Cecil
stepped towards the dining room.
   <p><squote>I'm sure you must be tired,</squote> his mother insisted. <squote>You're
very irritable, anyway.</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm NOT tired and I'm NOT irritable.</squote>
   <p><squote>Very well then.</squote> His mother nodded with understanding.
   <p><squote>You're not tired. Nobody's tired. Now just you run along
upstairs and wash your hands whilst I get dinner ready.</squote> Cecil
wriggled irritably under the misplaced management of a mother who had
failed to realise that a son who is nearly bald is no longer a baby.
He started to climb the stairs, stamping with unnecessary vigour upon
the treads. <squote>And don't wipe the dirt off on the towel like you did
yesterday. Your Auntie Edie's coming in for a cup of tea later and
you know how she has a good look round everywhere.</squote>
   <p>There was a tinkle and a thud from beside the coat cupboard.
Cecil's mother turned around in time to see the briefcase collapse
against the brass umbrella stand. <squote>Well now!</squote> She hurried towards
it and picked it up. <squote>What have we here? A new briefcase! So
THAT'S what it's all about.</squote>
   <p>Cecil halted in mid-step near the top of the stairs and clenched
his fists. <squote>So that's what WHAT'S all about?</squote> he hissed
without turning round.
   <p>She pointed to the briefcase. <squote>So that's why you are so
irritable. You thought that I'd think you'd been extravagant.</squote>
   <p><squote>But I'm NOT irritable!</squote> He rushed down the stairs and,
snatching the case, ran back upstairs with it. <squote>And I've NOT
been extravagant.</squote>
   <p><quote>Naughty!</squote> she called after him. <squote>Mother knows her boy
better than he does himself.</squote> She smiled at herself in the mirror
and reflected how mothers always know their dear impulsive boys better
than anyone &mdash; especially better than not so dear, not so impulsive
daughters-in-law. Her smile faded at the thought of female
competition, but brightened again in the belief that her son was not
cut out for that sort of nonsense. Widowed mothers often expect their
only sons to be very lone rangers.
   <p>Dinner was taken as usual before the television. Cecil's mother
had arranged the receiver to face two armchairs by the fire. They sat
uncomfortably hunched in mutual inclination, and ate at arm's length
from a common occasional table placed opposite their adjacent knees.
In the days when he had still a liking for cigarettes, Cecil had
well-nigh proved the statistical relationship between them and lung
cancer in an effort to obtain the table free by smoking his way into a
collection of six hundred gift tokens. The flush of achievement had
long passed and as Cecil sat, eyes on the television screen, not even
the napkin tucked into his neck could prevent lamb-chop gravy from
carelessly bespattering the table he had risked so much to obtain.
   <p>Mother and son gazed in fascination at the story, unfolding
before their eyes, of corn cultivation in Capokoland. <squote>What time's
the Olde Tyme Dancing on?</squote> she asked absently. <squote>My goodness,
look at those women planting things, isn't it primitive?</squote>
   <p><squote>About ten-o'clock, I suppose, the Olde Tyme stuff.</squote>

<text id=LOBR03>
He did, however, give her the name and address of a very good
lawyer who had got him an injunction to restrain a firm from
publishing a book until the author had removed a passage attacking him
for some slander which had been, in fact, a case of Privilege.
   <p>
   <p>In spite of all the transferred maternity she was endowed with by
her patients, poor Serena was an infant-in-arms as a buyer of
property. No, not even an infant-in-arms but a new-born babe, a
premature piece of frailty in an oxygen-tent of utter innocence.
   <p>The complexity of that innocence was colossal. It had layer
after layer of illusion to be peeled off and replaced with sad
knowledgeability. It was a nakedness of nai"vety to be clothed leaf
by leaf with the disappointment of experience.
   <p>Her first illusion consisted in the belief that all she need do
was to go to an agent, visit half a dozen houses in one day, choose
one, make an offer, put it in the hands of a lawyer and go away on her
holiday while the whole transaction was put through. At the worst,
she could postpone their holiday, if she didn't find anything she
liked at once. August would after all be a little hot for Greece.
All that mattered was moving. For quite suddenly she couldn't stand
their flat any more. She must come back to something new, even if it
meant shortening their trip abroad or taking an extra week off to get
settled in.
   <p>She soon found that Tom Stevens was right about the prices,
whatever their cause. The market, moreover, seemed more like one of
her graph representations of a psychotic's dream world than a rational
state of affairs carefully calculated by a handful of wicked
speculators, though she supposed that these latter might well be the
chosen instruments of the city's collective unconscious. For the
prices of houses bore no relation whatsoever to their size, beauty, or
convenience, only to some lunatic hierarchy of districts by which any
area, however traffic-ridden, that could by any considerable wrench of
the imagination be called a Village, was also the most plutocratic in
its price-range; that is, any piece of town with one pretty street,
square, corner, stretch of river, bit of heath, common or park, round
which lesser, uglier streets clustered hopefully, borrowing the same
name for themselves as crescents, gardens, garden-crescents, rises,
hills, hill-rises, ways and ends, mewses, lanes, groves and vales,
could aspire to and perhaps eventually earn the name of Village. Slum
terraces and workers' cottages would be bought up, sometimes by
enterprising individuals but more often by the wicked speculators for
a profitable sale to less enterprising individuals, and one by one the
black brick houses would turn white, or pink or blue, with bright
yellow doors and flower-boxes in the windows. <quote>This street,</quote> the
agents would say, <quote>hasn't quite come.</quote> When it did so, and several
more around it, the area would at last receive by way of final
decoration and of course price-promotion, the name of Village.
   <p>Second to Villages were the Best Residential Areas, where the
affluent middle class had always lived, but they were, after all,
limited and unexpandable, and now that practically everyone was
affluent middle-class, the Best Residential Areas were so much in
demand that prices shot up well beyond the range of the affluent
middle-class, and only the milk-bar millionaires lived there,
expense-account experts, some of the more successful comedians, the
odd reckless film-star, and of course the speculators themselves.
Fortunately, however, the fashion for Victorian architecture which
Mr. John Betjeman had started several decades before had caught on
at last and therefore saved the situation for the affluent
middle-class, who now had plenty of lovely-ugly to be coldly elegant
in.
   <p>All this Serena discovered, and more, but in stages. For the
first thing she did was to make an offer on a small pink terraced
cottage, two beds, two inter-comm. rec., mod. k. and b.,
sep. W.C. small back yard, newly dec., near shops and tube in
up-and-coming Camden Town Village, &pound;6,000 Freehold.
   <p>The next thing that Serena discovered was that she could not
afford to buy a house at all. And this in spite of having at last
managed to save the ten percent needed. Or so she thought, being then
in possession of what seemed to her the princely sum of six hundred
pounds.
   <p>The lawyer said:
   <p><quote>Of course you must count about two hundred for legal charges
and stamp duties, maybe less, depending on the price of the house, and
whether it has been registered. I take it you have a mortgage lined
up, then, Mrs. &mdash; er &mdash; Buttery?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not yet, but the bank would give me a loan, I'm sure.</quote>
   <p><quote>Er, yes. You have some securities, then?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, no. Just my work. And my husband's.</quote>
   <p><quote>No ... life insurance?</quote>
   <p>Serena had more in common with Stella than she realised, for the
word security had meant little to her until now, when she felt this
sudden urge to buy property, paying off a mortgage like rent for
twenty years and then living free of expense, she thought, when they
were <quote>old and grey and full of sleep</quote> &mdash; though she hoped she would
never be as psychologically asleep as all that. All she had ever
bothered to insure was her conscious self against just such a
submerging sleep.
   <p>She shook her head at Mr. Clacton, who seemed asleep enough
himself, both in her terms and his, for it was a hot day and his
office was stuffed to its low ceiling with undisturbed books,
undisturbed files and dust from probably Dickensian times. His aspect
was as dusty as his office, with scurf from dusty hair on the dusty
shoulders of his black suit, cigarette ash down the front, an ashen
face and yellow sleepy dust in the corners of his pale grey eyes. His
finger-nails were dirty, though he tried to make up for it by
constantly paring them with the finger-nail of the opposite hand. His
voice was like his black and pin-stripe, a grey superimposition of
respectability over the original colour of his own natural vowels, the
result being somehow as ineffective, not just dusty-grey but muddy,
slimy even. His digressions too, seemed to have no other purpose than
the throwing of dust in his client's eyes, the dust of fake security,
of the fake friend of the family, like the puffs from his Gauloises,
which said ~<squote>Don't you worry your fluffy little head about that, just
lull back in the layers of my experience,</squote> as he told her how he had
saved one of his clients from buying a house in which he somehow owned
all the bricks and mortar but not the joists, which had been omitted
from the Deeds, and how he had learnt from another client who was a
greengrocer that all greengrocers cheat the income-tax by a
complicated system of unrecorded purchases which has become the norm
at Covent Garden.
   <p><quote>Yes, well....</quote> He judged that she had been sufficiently
dazzled and gave a long raucous cough. <quote>Only cigarettes worth
smoking, these. Most unhealthy, English ones. Well, now, let me see.
I think I can put you onto some people who might, I say might, let
you have a mortgage on this property....</quote>
   <p><quote>But, they're safe, are they? I mean, they're not &mdash;
money-lenders?</quote>
   <p><quote>Mrs. &mdash; er &mdash; Buttery, all mortgage companies are money-lenders.
That's rather the point, isn't it?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, but I mean &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>I know what you mean. You may trust me, Mrs. Buttery. I
think, however, that you might have to revise your ideas about &mdash; er &mdash;
the type of property you intend to purchase.</quote>
   <p>She revised them.
   <p>The little man from the Inter-Insular (British Archipelago)
Insurance Company soon saw to that. He was bald and bouncy, jumping
up from her sofa with each explanation, whether because of the sherry
she offered him or from a passionate interest in his work she couldn't
tell. When he had jumped up some twenty times, talked of premiums,
policies, tax exemptions and survey fees, worked out sums rapidly on
Inter-Insular Insurance Company sheets of paper which he produced from
a shiny black brief-case, asked many questions about Rupert's age,
health and income, even his salesman's patter failed to smooth over
the traumatic experience undergone by Serena's relatively sheltered
psyche that afternoon.
   <p>Poor Serena. In spite of the good marks she had brought home
from school she had never grasped the implications or practical
application of compound interest. She used to solve all the problems
set of course, but her conscious mind must have refused to accept the
moral shock of it all, so that even now at the age of forty and eleven
months, she still assumed that if one borrowed six thousand pounds at
six per cent, one paid back, in the end, six thousand plus six per
cent of six thousand, that is, six thousand three hundred and sixty
pounds. The meaning of the words <quote>per annum</quote> had somehow got
lost with the years.
   <p>Her second shock was the mortgage rating.
   <p><quote>You see, Mrs. Buttery,</quote> said the little man rather sadly
now, but very fast, like a comic spouting gags, <quote>the value of the
policy would be worked out entirely according to your husband's
earnings. I'm afraid we can't take yours into account at all. It's a
rule of I.I.I. You see, you might stop work to have &mdash; well,
for all sorts of reasons, or you might leave him.</quote>
   <p><quote>But how utterly extraordinary,</quote> said Serena angrily, <quote>you
must be living in the nineteenth century.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, but it's a very general rule, Mrs. Buttery, you'll find
that no insurance companies, or building societies, for that matter,
will allow for the wife's earnings. Our lawyers &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Who are your lawyers?</quote>
   <p><quote>Clacton's.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I'm damned.</quote>
   <p><quote>Now, let me see, you say your husband earns about ... yes, that
would come to ... three, carry seven, six nines are fifty four &mdash; of
course we'd have to have some sort of proof, you know, it's very
difficult with self-employed persons, carry two. Yes. I'm afraid we
couldn't raise this loan to more than three thousand three fifty at
the most. Now you could get quite a nice little semi-detached house
in Grimstead for three thousand, that's where I live, just before the
green belt, lovely and modern, you know. I forgot to tell you, we
don't usually lend any house built earlier than 1918.</quote>
   <p>But Serena was not easily discouraged. She had, moreover, a
reasonable endowment of intelligence and enough analytical training,
specialised though it was, to get to grips with the more megalomaniac
vagaries of an unfamiliar world. Within three days she had worked it
all out. It was all quite clear. Houses were too expensive, at any
rate for poor self-employed individualists like themselves, who
nevertheless hankered for respectability and membership of the new and
widespread, property-owning, affluent middle-class. Therefore they
would buy part of a house. The market was flooded with long-lease
flats for sale, on one and sometimes two floors of vast Victorian
mansions, bought up by speculators and converted with more paint than
architecture, a glass door here and there, a vine-leaf or cabbage-rose
paper on one of the walls, a stainless steel kitchen-sink with perhaps
a &pound;45 waste-disposal unit to send the price up by a couple of hundred
more.
   <p><quote>You see,</quote> she propounded to Rupert after her last patient had
gone, <quote>we can get three thousand three fifty, perhaps a little more
if we can cheat your earnings a bit. I'm sure you could raise the
rest from one of your publishers, get two books commissioned and write
them later. I've got a bit owing too. Now, I saw some flats in
Hendon for four thou, and some in West Hampstead for four two fifty,
two beds, two reception, k. and b., just think, our own bathroom.
Much more spacious than that poky little cottage, which wasn't a bit
practical really, the reception room was too small when divided and
too big when not.

<head>My Work for the Russian Secret Service</head>
<head>By BERNARD HOLLOWOOD, in an interview with Barry Normanton</head>
   <p>I HAD been working at the Council of Industrial Design, in
Petty France, for about three months when it happened. One day my
secretary announced that <quote>a foreign-looking gentleman</quote> wished to
see me about a new plastic fabric he had invented.
   <p><quote>Plastics, schmastics!</quote> I said. <quote>Tell him I'm not ...</quote>
And at that moment Mr. Rudi Smith announced himself and strode into
the office.
   <p><quote>Please, see,</quote> he said, holding up a square of shiny material,
<quote>it don't creasing, it don't shrinking, it don't ripping. I
show.</quote> He tugged at the plastic which immediately and noiselessly
split down the middle. Mr. Smith laughed. <quote>Ah,</quote> he said, <quote>I
notice you having sense of humour.</quote>
   <p>Over lunch I got to know him better.
   <p>We arranged to meet again in Toni's Caf&eacute; off Bread Street.
For recognition purposes I was to carry a small hammer in one hand, a
tiny sickle in the other, and the password was to be <quote>Herbert
Read.</quote> Fifteen years ago I was pretty innocent. You will have to
believe me when I tell you that my suspicions were not yet aroused.
   <p>Over coffee and pretzels we talked. I complimented him on the
improvement in his English. <quote>It is nothing,</quote> he said. <quote>I
perfected my speech in order to know you better.</quote>
   <p>And then he launched into a long, exciting history of the birth
of Communism, giving credit punctiliously to the work in England of
Marx and Engels, and touching briefly on such matters as dialectical
materialism, the marginal utility of land, and Ernest Bevin.
   <p><quote>You too are for freedom, comrade,</quote> he said.
   <p>I nodded my agreement.
   <p><quote>It is a new technique, evolved in the Kiev University Faculty
of Psychological Warfare. It is called brain-washing.</quote>
   <p>What Mr. Smith wanted me to do &mdash; and he was of course prepared
to pay handsomely, in pounds, dollars, ration books, anything &mdash; was to
deal him the details, plans and prototypes of the goods being
collected together for the great <quote>Britain Can Make It</quote> exhibition.
He seemed particularly interested in Wedgwood beakers, a Decca
record-player and Cooper's Oxford Marmalade.
   <p><quote>But if you think British industrial design is so hot,</quote> I
said, <quote>why don't you go ahead and copy it, like the Japanese?</quote>
   <p><quote>That would be unethical,</quote> he said, shaking his head.
<quote>Besides we haven't the manpower available for such work.</quote>
   <p>Every month for two years we met, never of course at the same
place twice. Usually it was in the stand at a football match, in some
billiards saloon or strip show. Then we would repair, separately and
by different routes, to his rooms on the eighth floor of the Sudbury
Hotel in Chiswick, where he kept a small radio transmitter and all the
other paraphernalia of his nefarious craft.
   <p><quote>To think,</quote> I said to him one day, <quote>that in a few moments
these microfilmed working drawings of Mappin's improved percolator
will be in Moscow!</quote>
   <p><quote>Alas,</quote> he said, <quote>the radius of transmission is small. The
information will be picked up by our receiver in Reigate and from
there smuggled out of the country by pigeon &mdash; first to Dinard, then to
Ko"ln, and from there by fast car to Moscow.</quote>
   <p>The first break in our arrangement occurred after about eighteen
months. He had been complaining about the slow rate at which I was
feeding him the designs of British consumer goods. <quote>Moscow,</quote> he
said, <quote>is furious. The second five-year plan is nearly up and all we
have so far are the drawings for a new cut-glass decanter, an improved
aluminium percolator, a trouser-press and a pen that writes wet with
dry ink. The economy of the USSR is becoming lop-sided.
Beyond the Urals 350,000 men and women sit idle at the giant
refrigerator plant waiting for plans. Our department store is
overflowing with pens. Stalin is livid.</quote>
   <p>And then he told me about Russia's long-term struggle to wage
economic war on the West. <quote>The bomb means military stalemate,</quote> he
said. <quote>From now on we fight for economic supremacy in the world's
markets, in the uncommitted nations. We Russians have no experience
of consumer goods. You British are renowned as the world's
shopkeepers, so &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Some people,</quote> I interrupted, <quote>would say that the Americans
now have the lead in industrial design.</quote>
   <p><quote>American design is vulgar. No character. The British have
dignity and taste and quality. Please, comrade, will you not
co-operate in the interests of world Communism?</quote>
   <p>After this I visited Mr. Smith very seldom, and if my memory
serves me correctly, the only additional secrets I handed over were
plans for a new-style cardigan, a patent cycle hub-cap, a beer-engine
and some air-line cutlery. Our m&eacute;salliance slowly collapsed and
until last week I had almost succeeded in forgetting all about it.
   <p>What brought it back were the recorded impressions made by
BBC reporters of their May Day visit to Moscow. Several of
them visited the great department store, Gum, and were surprised to
find that many of the goods on sale bore a striking resemblance to
their counterparts in British shops &mdash; particularly the ball-point
pens, cardigans and cut-glass decanters.
   <p>Needless to say, I was not surprised.
<head>GWYN THOMAS</head>
<head>Growing up in Meadow Prospect</head>
<head>6 Reluctant Trouper</head>
   <p>MOST of us come through the years flanked by actors
manqu&eacute;s who placate the virus by getting hold of us from time to
time, plastering paint on our faces and pushing us into any strong
light that happens to be handy.
   <p>My own Svengali was a teacher called Howie. Over the whole
period of my youth he kept after me. I don't know exactly what kind
of a dog Francis Thompson's Hound of Heaven was but if it was
surer-footed than Howie I would be surprised. I am not sure what the
Hound wanted of Thompson but what Howie required of me was very
simple. He wanted me to act.
   <p>The relationship began in the Primary School. I was about ten.
Howie was a graduate who had failed to get a Grammar School post. He
was disgruntled, idle and apparently mad. He had a dark, dissolute
face and his main tactic was to lean against a window ledge, looking
at us from between his fingers, as if, for sanity's sake, he was
rationing the sight of us. The school's curriculum was narrow and
Howie, by the use of a silent inertia, brought it to the point of
vanishing. He was convinced that we were all perfectly able to write,
spell and figure, but that we were making a show of being misinformed
to bring Howie a daily inch nearer his last seizure. At any show of
idiocy he would shout: <quote>Nature bleeds, but I didn't go to University
to be a first-aid man. Wound it some more.</quote>
   <p>Howie was a Welsh nationalist. He swam like a duck around the
tank of tears that is fixed firmly in any Celtic past. He wrote
patriotic playlets. Howie had stared at me for a long time and he
said I had the true truculent face of an embattled Celt, the sort of
features that had looked down at the Saxons through the fogs of
Snowdon, thickening them. I tried to explain to Howie that my scowl
had nothing to do with my being Welsh or a bristling insurgent. I
looked the way I did because I was in the first stage of nicotine
poisoning, genuinely foxed in my attempts to find any hint of promise
or logic in my environment, and subject to some terrible ventral
upsets brought on by an unwise excess of lentils in the Meadow
Prospect diet.
   <p>But I played along with Howie. The play cycle he had written had
two wheels: anguish and insurrection, and I was the boy who did the
major pedalling. My first appearance in each case was as a captive
and in this Howie left nothing to the fancy. I would walk on to the
stage bowed down by chains. These were very real chains and they
slowed me down considerably. Most of the first act was taken up with
me moving from the wings to the middle of the stage, clanking and
enraged, to be told by some king or chieftain to get used to these
trimmings because they were to be on me for life. I hated those
chains. They had been left in the Memorial Hall by some escapologist
with a leaking memory who forgot not only the essential details of
trickery that would have him sailing out of boxes and sacks, but also
left his equipment behind him. In the Memorial Hall he had had
himself chained up and enclosed in a sealed barrel from which he
proposed to make his escape in four minutes. The darkness must have
put him off his stroke, or the chains were of too honest a brand. It
took two coopers or hoopers to get him out.
   <p>The play on which Howie expended the most labour was one which
showed St. David founding his cathedral on the cliffs of
Pembrokeshire where a couple of his shin bones can still be seen.
There was some talk of my taking the part of the saint and I worked
my face into a whole new set of patterns to be able to present a
picture of gentle innocence. I thought that this might possibly mark
the opening of a new phase of more tractable and nourishing
relationships with my fellows, and I could shed that iron top-coat.
But Howie was dubious. The sight of me fettered and revolted had
become one of his drawing cards, and it seemed to pull a satisfying
bristle of excitement over the dry skin of his psyche.
   <p>He enquired of a few local hagiologists as to whether St. David
had ever gone around in chains. They said no, all agreeing that David
had been a fairly limber intriguer with a way of keeping on the right
side of the gyves. Then Howie had the idea of casting me as the
sullen landlord, a pagan bully, who takes pleasure in saying that he
would much prefer to put David over the cliff than let him have the
land required for building the cathedral. But Howie could see no way
of having this landlord appear in chains. The whole point of the play
was that from the beginning to the end where he is struck down by a
miracle this landlord is a puissant and overbearing man. But Howie
worked me in after a lot of hard thinking. In the last scene the
landowner is raising a club to St. David and the saint just stands
there smiling, not even lifting his pastoral crook. In the original
version the landlord gets his quittance by some bit of intercession
from on high. Howie had favoured a bolt but this would have been hard
to stage, so he fell back on a stroke. Then he got an even sharper
idea. As the argument between the landowner and the saint is warming
up a very fierce-looking felon, chained, is brought on by an escort of
gaolers on his way to the gibbet. That was me, back to base. I ask
my captors for a few minutes' pause. The gibbet is a fair way from
the gaol and the chains are heavy. I stare at the saint. I am trying
to remember something. The memory gets through. Years before, in the
middle of some bit of delinquency I had been caught and led before the
saint. He had fed me and advised me to go straight. He had even
given me an address to which I could go and apply for some sort of
honest work. But I had been making too much of a noise with my eating
to catch the last part of the address, and in any case I was stupid
with youth and flushed with confidence. The food had merely given me
fresh strength to move more briskly towards some new bit of
crookedness.

<head>The Ghostess</head>
<head>by BETTY JAMES</head>
   <p><squote>AND,</squote> added my teenage son, <squote>we shall also need a
Necking Room.</squote>
   <p>Coming as it did upon previous requests for beer and cigarettes,
this caused me violently to wish that I had never agreed to a party at
all, in spite of the fact that my son had filled me with pride by
undertaking a paper-round to pay for it.
   <p>Catching me in a busy moment, he had asked me if I would mind
lending the sitting-room for a dance for his friends; and I &mdash; my
sanity clouded with visions of launching my boy handsomely into a
reciprocal round of innocent entertainment &mdash; had foolhardily agreed to
roll up the carpet one night and to go and do my typing elsewhere.
   <p>Owing to my son's easy-going disposition and preference for the
exotic and the modern, it suddenly dawned upon me that I was about to
meet a posse of embryo beatniks and, as the date of the party
approached and the needs of the occasion became more and more
horrifying, I began to doubt the wisdom of my agreeing. Patently, the
party was due to last all night. I telephoned a few of my more
off-beat friends and was indulgently advised to give the kids what
they wanted unless I wished my son to be socially ostracised &mdash; and to
go out and leave them to it. This, however, I firmly refused to do.
To come back to the home I had built with the sweat of my brow,
typing my fingers down to the knuckles, and to find it full of drunken
children and irate parents beating at the door of the Necking Room was
more than I could stomach. I decided secretly to buy some ginger-ale
and to creep around like Banquo &mdash; popping it into the beer.
   <p>And so... Dawn having finally flung her most ominous Stone, I
went to work in aweful prescience and came back ready to do my son
proud if it killed me.
   <p>To my amazement, I found three children already there, working
away like blacks. Or &mdash; I should say &mdash; two of them were working like
blacks and one of them (my son) was directing operations in a masterly
fashion. The carpet had already been taken into the bathroom; a
charming boy was polishing the floor of the sitting room; and an
adorable little girl, who was introduced to me as <squote>Marblehead,</squote> was
making sandwiches in the kitchen.
   <p>Apart from being touched to my very soul I was also sickened to
my stomach to think that these innocent little darlings were about to
turn into hideous, beer-swilling, chain-smoking, Necking monsters in a
very short time. At an age and time of day when, in my own youth,
Christopher Robin was Saying His Prayers, the pink and healthy chip
off my own block was probably about to sprout horns and a tail.
   <p>
   <p>OUR flat consists of a sitting room and two bedrooms.
Feeling it less of a condonation of the corybantic diableries about
to be performed by the invited jeunesse dor&eacute;, I had
allotted my own bedroom for Necking, prudently removing both the bed
and the key, and taken both myself and my typewriter into my son's
bedroom.
   <p>At intervals between 6 and 7 p.m. bunches of children
arrived and, to my surprise, I was hauled out with each new invasion
to be introduced by my son with what seemed to be a certain amount of
inexplicable pride. Inexplicable, because our guests looked at me
doubtfully, possibly due to the fact that I had not dressed to meet
anybody, since I had expected to be kept well out of sight. I was
wrapped in my usual working costume of huge and somewhat grubby red
flannel dressing-gown, I had omitted to don a face and &mdash; another
normal concession to work &mdash; had twined curlers in my hair in order to
deter my fingers from plunging wildly through my new hair-do in
moments of creative stress.
   <p>Finally, to my dismay, three boys arrived bearing musical
instruments and the festivities got under way.
   <p>I had placed the beer in a strategic position on the hall chest
outside my son's door so that I could listen for the moment when
childish thirst overcame caution and the time arrived for the ginger
ale to be wielded as a defensive weapon. For an hour nothing
happened, nobody came near the beer, and I typed away with my other
ear attuned to my bedroom door &mdash; which remained firmly closed.
   <p>The noise from the sitting-room was deafening but tuneful. The
boy prodigies might play loudly &mdash; but they were obviously able to play
in tune.
   <p>
   <p>AFTER another hour of this I heard footsteps approaching and
dashed for my deterrents. Whether in drink or deflowerment I was
obviously about to have to defend to the death the innocence of some
defenceless girl. All very well for my friends to tell me that my son
was doomed to a lonely and celibate life if I interfered. That was
before I had laid eyes on all those Bright Young Things. All right,
go on and tell me that they are nothing but disburgeoned delinquents &mdash;
they didn't look like that to me.
   <p>My door opened and a child of about fifteen put her head round
it. She looked at me for a second, wide-eyed, and then asked, <squote>Am I
interrupting you?</squote> I assured her that her visit was welcome and,
encouraged, she added, <squote>Are we making too much noise?</squote> I thanked
her for her thoughtfulness and explained that, since this was my son's
party, I did not feel entitled to complain. She then asked me why I
didn't come and join the party.
   <p>This undoubted compliment took me by surprise. I thanked her
very much and told her that I was quite happy and felt that my
interference at this stage would not only be unsuitable, but would
also make her unpopular with her contemporaries.
   <p>After I had explained what I meant she seemed flattered and
pleased but emphatically denied that parents were necessarily squares
and thus geometrically unsuited to teenage coruscations.
   <p>In fact, we had an enlightening conversation &mdash; on both our parts.
   <p><squote>Angus told me that you write,</squote> she stated, as if this fact
whilst inarguably forever condemning me to the ranks of tepid
Bohemianism &mdash; nevertheless earned for me the right of entry into any
company, even theirs.
   <p>After this she, and a couple of friends she had called to the
rescue, helped me to a pair of leopard-skin tights and a black sweater
from my depleted wardrobe and I was hustled into the sitting-room and
taught the rock n' roll , the cha-cha and other gay, if
labyrinthine, mystiques. Five of the elder boys (including the
instrumentalists, who deserved it) drank four bottles of beer apiece;
the others fell with delighted cries on the ginger-ale. The
sandwiches were devoured, and one small girl fell asleep in the
Necking Room. At 9.30 the lights were turned out and dancing
continued in the dark. I returned to my work and the little girl in
the Necking Room slept undisturbed.
   <p>Nine of the children left at 10.45 obviously with appreciable
respect for the instructions of stern, but just parents. Three boys
(one the brother of the sleeping child) stayed overnight &mdash; after
phoning for permission &mdash; to help restore order in the morning.
   <p>
   <p>AMONGST my so-called grown-up acquaintances where shall I
ever find gathered together such a charming, friendly, unspoilt and
generous cross-section of humanity as graced our home on the night of
my son's party?
   <p>Where are the profligate little terrors I hear about? Not
necessarily (as some would have it) amongst the members of
co-educational schools. These young people seem to have acquired a
healthier slant on life than have some of their more conventional
contemporaries and, if they are a sample of youth today, the
psychiatrists' couches of the future should creak much less frequently
as they get ready to bear the burden of yet another pathological
despair.

that he was a medical practitioner, a doctor replied: <squote>Yes, sir. I
am a medical practitioner &mdash; in fact, one of the best in the

   <p>Ribbed afterwards by a colleague for immodesty and unprofessional
conduct, the M.D. replied: <squote>Alas! What else could I say?
After all, I was on oath.</squote>
<head>Castle Wanted</head>
<head>by JOHN HAMMOND</head>
<head><squote>Being a Top Person, it would appear, is not so much a question
of balance as a state of mind....</squote></head>
   <p>THE British character is not quite dead. That is what I am
able, and delighted, to report after devoting twelve months to reading
the personal column of The Times &mdash; that daily barometer of the
hopes, the fears, and the dreams of the nation's Top People. Even in
the 1960s, it seems, there are still among us independent spirits who
refuse to allow their horizons to be limited by the 8.15 and the
goggle-box; who will go anywhere and do anything, fight a duel, hire a
parachutist (<squote>either sex</squote>) for a special assignment, and are in the
market for anything, from a rocking horse, <squote>traditional</squote>, to a
chastity belt, <squote>metal overlaid with velvet</squote>.
   <p>Reduced to their baser elements the motives that drive anyone to
invest in a few lines of Times type are not so greatly different
from those of advertisers in lesser journals: the desire to acquire
something you have not got yourself, including money; the
complementary urge to sell someone else something you have yourself
but would sooner be without.
   <p>What distinguishes a Times Personal Column ad. is its
careless, well-bred panache. For example, lots of people in
this sad, overcrowded little world of ours suffer from a housing
problem but how different from the pathetic appeal in the local
newsagent's window is ~<squote>I am urgently seeking an enormous country
house anywhere in England...</squote>, or ~<squote>Castle wanted as permanent home
by young couple....</squote>
   <p>There is, however, a hint of well-bred panic in ~<squote>Agonized
family (5) aesthetic and practical ambitions, urgently require
Georgian (or similar) house... derelict castle, unmanageable mansion
or anything...</squote>; and perhaps an appeal to the esprit de corps
which, one imagines, exists among our Top People, in ~<squote>My husband
and I, Nanny and the children will be homeless next January unless you
sell or let us that six bedroomed Georgian country house on the
Herts-Essex borders that we have sought sorrowfully these last
two years....</squote>
   <p>Nor should one assume that money is no object with every
advertiser. Being a Top Person, it would appear, is not so much a
question of bank balance as a state of mind, and sprinkled among the
demands for ancestral homes are to be found requests like the one from
<squote>Impoverished, very junior executive</squote> in need of living space.
Naturally though, it has to be within walking distance of Mayfair,
but, apart from that, an attic with only a shower and a gas ring will
suffice.
   <p>Practitioners of the arts are to be found at both ends of the
financial scale, from the quiet-seeking writer wishing to rent a wing
of a <squote>too-large castle</squote> or mansion in the Scottish Highlands (<squote>a
library, music room, or private chapel would be much appreciated</squote>)
to the <squote>very poor novelist</squote> in search of shelter for himself and
some furniture in London, <squote>charitable offers only, please.</squote>
   <p>
   <p>THE possession of a four-footed friend is a problem to all
seekers after a roof and puts the experienced advertiser on his
mettle. The bravura of ~<squote>Accommodation for amiable bloodhound,
grand piano and architect owner sought; old vicarage? ~Disused wing?
~Help!</squote> has already been celebrated by a leading article in the
journal in which it appeared; but equally moving, in a more restrained
key, is ~<squote>Old English Sheepdog pup and Canadian Gentleman desire to
be paying guests at Farm or Country House....</squote>
   <p>However, even if the worst happens, the Top Person's dogs &mdash;
provided they are few and small &mdash; may be <squote>boarded out en
famille</squote>, in another advertiser's country residence. And their
felines, you will be relieved to know, may find accommodation suited
to their station at the <squote>Cat-a-Guest House</squote>, with <squote>expert care;
cuisine a speciality.</squote>

   <p>Vence is a sober spot, half way between small town and village,
pigeon grey, sly with arches, and linked by a whispering plot of
fountains. In the main tree-heavy square you can sit in the autumn
sunshine, still burning like a half-cooled iron, sip \pastis and
read the local newspapers. One called La Patriote is
Communist, and at the time of our arrival it was throwing huge
over-ripe verbal tomatoes at General \de Gaulle.
   <p>One side of this square is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's
Bar. For one day, with the help of the Syndicat \d'Initiative, we had
been hunting for furnished rooms, and had given up, when an elderly
lady, the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest, had firmly
closed the door in our noses. <squote>It is a pity,</squote> said Mart, <squote>because
it would have been a good address.</squote> Now, after a woman's radar
look, she decided Pierre would solve our problems.
   <p>This was true, Pierre was a true Proven&ccedil;al, thin and yellow as
lemon peel, wrestling with some gnawing rat of an illness, man of all
trades, married to a commanding lady who loved small talk and the
discreet accumulation of money. We went in. There were a few people
in the bar, elderly, well-off, artistic, who, you felt, had made a
hard bargain for giving up.
   <p><squote>I have furnished rooms,</squote> said Pierre, <squote>and all mod
cons.</squote> The price was 16,000 francs a month.
   <p><squote>Yes,</squote> we said immediately, even before viewing. We were
shown around by Pierre. The flat was on the third floor; two rooms;
soft Proven&ccedil;al view; good intimate furnishing and colour; running
hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up, basin and bidet;
own private, modern lavatory.
   <p>The first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence. We
were woken up twice about dawn by a soft eruption of turtle-doves.
This was strange, even magic, because the owner's name was Pierre
Tortorolo which, in Nicoison Italian means <squote>turtledove</squote>. Pierre
Turtledove. When we woke up properly it was raining, an even more
hopeless rain than London, and we looked out of the windows at the
weeping trees and the curling white breath of the mountains. The land
looked like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her shame.
There they were, in fact, below us, eight of them. Four of them were
flattened on the window sills, two immolated on a nearby roof top, the
other pair copulating.
   <p>We had a morning at Pierre's. He talked about people. Marc
Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named Lawrence. He was
here, near the railway station, three or four years. During this
period he wrote a book, The Lover of Lady Chatterly. No, he hadn't
read it; Madame did all the reading. Lawrence died in this very
place. He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and again. No, he
couldn't really remember him, he was one of the crowd.
   <p>The sun came out; Mart went shopping; I sat in the square reading
the \Patriote. There was a front-page rear-attack on \de Gaulle,
and the rest of the paper was given up to murders, apart for 
an outcry against a proposal to drop radio-active material into the
Mediterranean between Corsica and St Raphael. All the murders were
well documented and had the air of being written by an ingenious, but
mad film director of the Thirties. They mostly occurred in lonely
farm-houses.
   <p>Monsieur H, for instance, had been clubbed and throttled to
death by his wife, children and father-in-law, after muddling up some
sheep while the worse for drink. The family group then sat down for a
late lunch before the father-in-law telephoned the police. Then
again, Monsieur V, owing to family troubles, had written to the
local paper and the superintendent of police, informing them that he
was on the point of committing suicide, and gratefully leaving his
house appurtenances and utensils to the superintendent. Monsieur
V's house was immediately surrounded by firemen and other officials,
but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned a few minutes later from
a nearby village, apologising for the trouble, but explaining that the
walls were porous and the gas had escaped.
   <p>General relief was expressed, but Monsieur V (this was actually
reported in the next issue) returned home and shot himself, leaving a
note which again left his household goods to the superintendent. Some
grim comic relief was provided by an elderly farm labourer out for a
shoot who hid himself in a bush and imitated a blackbird.
Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver was after this very bird and
shot the farm-labourer in the face. All, however, ended well,
reported the paper, since the pellets were easily removed and the
labourer was able to return to work the same afternoon.
   <p>We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta. You can free-wheel
down a quarter of the way. In the middle of the journey is a valley
with a sea of vines and olives and beaches of earth pricked to blood
by the hoe. Rising from the flecked sea are islands tapering to
shipwrecked castles and towns, grey, rose-headed mariners clinging
like limpets to the rock. There is a curd of morning smoke and a
muffled bell taps the sky. Here we stopped, as in fine weather we
always stopped.
   <p>Down below is the village of Cagnes, but between are pockets of
heat and cold like the hands of friends or strangers, and a flurry of
early smells, the dark bosoms of beech and the thin pine fingers
kissed by the sun.
   <p>Then here was Nice, and the old holiday sea, blue as a new school
exercise book. The same old Nice, creamy, vulgar, out of time,
bitter-sweet with the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
prostitutes, edging past grubby grandeur to the old sleeping port.
This, and Paris, were my ruined pavilions, and I could catch the
taste of dead dreams on my tongue like spray.
   <p>We parked the Lambretta opposite the Negresco, and went to the
beach to have a swim. Amazing bedlam rocked in our eyes. The sea
boiled with waves, they galloped to the walls and spumed over the
Promenade \des Anglais. A huge crowd had collected. There were
firemen and policemen and ambulances, and the eyes of the spectators
were hard with disaster. They all had that neat look of Mediterranean
people to whom nothing could ever happen, the chosen sane, the
uncuckolded, unrobbed, sheltered from disease and accident by doctors,
God and the municipality. Yet, at any time now, the bell would ring
for them &mdash; the gilded love house, the mad grandmother or the bloody
child at the crossroads. Mart, too, was sucked into the crowd, not
because she felt immune from horror, but because for her the world was
always ending, except in bed. I joined her. Far out at sea we could
see a circular rubber object with a body on it. The body was the
colour of rotten marble.
   <p><squote>It's a woman,</squote> said Mart. A boat was approaching it, and
someone in oilskins leant over the boat and fell in. It was
accidental, but nobody in the crowd made a sound. It was as if the
visible world were an infamous church. Then two men grappled on to
the marble body and slowly dragged it up on to the boat.
   <p>It was growing cold. We left the crowd and drove back to Vence.
The cool evening perfumes stood beckoning at the corners of the
roads. Mart is unable to smell (her sense organs were impaired years
ago), and I had to explain the low, sharp and sweet signals in the
air. When we got back home we felt exhausted. London sickness (a
sense of guilt, mingled with the memory of sandwiches and incestuous
Soho pubs) still numbed our brains and bodies. We went straight to
bed and slept until the turtle-doves drummed up the sun.
   <p>The next morning, in the square opposite Pierre's, I read about
the Nice beach catastrophe in the \Patriote. Mart had been right,
the body had been a woman's. It belonged to a Madame N. Enquiries
had been made in the neighbourhood, and it transpired that Madame
N's husband had made an arrangement with the dead lady's sister to
launch her into the strong sea and there be left to perish. The
sister, able to swim, had returned to the shore, but instead of
returning to her brother-in-law (with whom she had an illicit
relationship), she went to her fianc&eacute;'s house and confessed
everything. Her fianc&eacute; reported her to the police, and then jumped
off a cliff near Monte Carlo.
<head>Homage for Isaac Babel</head>
<head>DORIS LESSING</head>
   <p>The day I promised to take Catherine down to visit my young
friend Philip at his school in the country, we were to leave at
eleven, but she arrived at nine. Her blue dress was new, and so were
her fashionable shoes. Her hair had just been done. She looked more
than ever like a pink and gold Renoir girl who expects everything from
life.
   <p>Catherine lives in a white house overlooking the sweeping brown
tides of the river. She helped me clean up my flat with a devotion
which said that she felt small flats were altogether more romantic
than large houses. We drank tea, and talked mainly about Philip, who,
being 15, has pure stern tastes in everything from food to music.
Catherine looked at the books lying around his room, and asked if she
might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel to read on the train.
Catherine is 13. I suggested she might find them difficult, but she
said, <squote>Philip reads them, doesn't he?</squote>
   <p>During the journey I read newspapers and watched her pretty
frowning face as she turned the pages of Babel, for she was determined
to let nothing get between her and her ambition to be worthy of
Philip.
   <p>At the school, which is charming, civilised and expensive, the
two children walked together across green fields, and I followed,
seeing how the sun gilded their bright friendly heads turned towards
each other as they talked. In Catherine's left hand she carried the
stories of Isaac Babel.
   <p>After lunch we went to the pictures. Philip allowed it to be
seen that he thought going to the pictures just for the fun of it was
not worthy of intelligent people, but he made the concession, for our
sakes. For his sake we chose the more serious of the two films that
were showing in the little town. It was about a good priest who
helped criminals in New York. His goodness, however, was not enough
to prevent one of them from being sent to the gas chamber; and Philip
and I waited with Catherine in the dark until she had stopped crying
and could face the light of a golden evening.
   <p>At the entrance of the cinema the doorman was lying in wait for
anyone who had red eyes. Grasping Catherine by her suffering arm, he
said bitterly: <squote>Yes, why are you crying, he had to be punished for
his crime, didn't he?</squote> Catherine stared at him, incredulous.
Philip rescued her by saying with disdain: <squote>Some people don't know
right from wrong even when its  demonstrated to them.</squote>
The doorman turned his attention to the next red-eyed emerger from
the dark; and we went on together to the station, the children silent
because of the cruelty of the world.
   <p>Finally Catherine said, her eyes wet again: <squote>I think its
 all absolutely beastly, and I can't bear to think about
it.</squote> And Philip said: <squote>But we've got to think about it, don't you
see, because if we don't it'll just go on and on, don't you
see?</squote>
   <p>In the train going back to London I sat beside Catherine. She
had the stories open in front of her, but she said: <squote>Philip's
awfully lucky. I wish I went to that school. Did you notice that
girl who said hullo to him in the garden?

<head>Stopping and Mowing</head>
<head>(Instructions that should have come with my motor mower)</head>
   <p>WE WELCOME you to the ranks of satisfied owners of Motor
Mowers. Well, <squote>ranks</squote> is hardly the word, you think you're an
officer now you've got one of these, don't you, ha ha! Just because
your lawn is a bit bigger than the average suburban size, you see
yourself gently ambling behind this thing, painting a swathe of
perfect greensward as you go...
   <p>Who do you think you are? This is the cheapest model we make,
all gaudily painted to attract people like you. You must know that
proper lawns, belonging to stately homes or golf clubs, are made with
proper, dark green mowers, that the man sits on in a shiny steel
saddle; old mowers, that we made fifty years ago, efficient, heavy,
inherited by their owners, long before these modern notions of
egalitarianism and an expanding economy compelled us to turn out these
fiddling little things for people like you, to keep our factory going
in off periods, when we are not servicing these proper, old mowers for
our titled clients. However, since you've bought it, and much good
may it do you, here are a few hints.
<head>STARTING (a) From cold:</head>
   <p>1. Take the plug out. Watch that little tin thing sticking up;
it catches your knuckles when the spanner suddenly gives. We've given
you a set of spanners, made of lead.
   <p>2. Clean the plug, if possible. It will be smothered in oil,
because you have to put the oil in the petrol; there is no separate
lubrication system. You probably think the oil is ignited with the
petrol vapour in the cylinder, so how can you lubricate an engine with
smoke? Well, as you can see, it isn't ignited. It just wets the
plug.
   <p>3. Undo the nut at the bottom of the cylinder, and a lot more oil
will dribble out &mdash; well, you shouldn't have it on the grass yet.
Put the nut back &mdash; steady, not too tight, the bottom of the cylinder
is made of lead, too. Well, now you've broken the thread, just make
it as tight as you can.
   <p>3a. You've left the washer off that nut. That's why you broke
the thread. No garage will have a washer that size, you'd better
start looking for it in the grass.
   <p>4. Put plug back, and watch out for your other knuckles. Aah,
sorry! The same knuckles. Not too tight, you won't get away with
doing this just once, you'll only make it hard to undo again.
   <p>5. Kick starter (or pull rope, if it's one of those). Again.
Full choke. Again, again, again. Full throttle. Again twenty-seven
times, with every possible combination of throttle and choke. Again,
with half thrott &mdash;
   <p>6. Switch the petrol on, you fool.
   <p>7. Repeat (5). Then repeat (1-4), plug will be wetter than when
you started by now.
   <p>8. Repeat (5) again. Go and lie down for a bit.
   <p>9. Run like hell with it in gear.
<head>STARTING (b) From hot:</head>
   <p>It is impossible to start this engine from hot. It is something
to do with that oil vapour. Once you let it stop, you've had it,
you'll have to wait for it to get stone-cold and start from the
beginning. Just don't leave it for a second, and keep it roaring.
<head>ADJUSTMENT OF BLADES:</head>
   <p>There is a hairbreadth adjustment on this machine, between the
position where it just brushes the top of the grass and the one where
it digs great gashes in the earth. Practice with a new electric light
switch. If you can find a position where the light just flickers
between <squote>on</squote> and <squote>off</squote> you'll be able to wangle these blades.
Remember that they are finely, not to say neurotically adjusted.
Quite a small pebble will wrench the blades out of shape. You will
know when this has happened when they either make a frightful clanging
noise or won't go round at all. The people for whom we make our
proper mowers do not have pebbles on their lawns, let alone the small
metal fire engines, dolls' boots, plastic alphabets, nails and spoons
that litter yours.
<head>OPERATION:</head>
   <p>It is only possible to operate this machine at a steady trot.
At ordinary walking pace it will stall. And remember, the clutch is
not a gradual affair like the one on a car. The instant you engage it
the machine will rush away, with or without you. So it's no good
trying to cut round those silly little circular rosebeds you have.
This machine only mows in a dead straight line, any curves and you'll
dig into the earth. What do you expect for the price you paid, a
differential axle?
<head>MAINTENANCE:</head>
   <p>You will find a number of little contraptions with spring caps,
for putting the oil in. They won't leave room for the spout of any
oilcan, however thin; you'll just have to squirt away, making an oozy
mess, and hope some of it's getting in. Soon the spring caps will
come off, anyway; then there'll just be these little holes blocked
with oily grass.
   <p>Finally, three golden rules:
   <p>1. Keep a magnet for finding washers, spring caps, nuts, etc.
   <p>2. NEVER LET IT STOP.
   <p>3. Don't give your hand-mower away.
<head>Official Deceiver</head>
   <p>AS ANY typist knows, the typewriter reveals the subconscious
of the machine age mainly by three simple devices (or decives); the
confusion of c with v, of k with l, and the interchange of vowels
(e.g. paino for piano) or vonsonants. Much more
linguistic research has been devoted to these three <squote>major</squote>
substitutions than to the two <squote>minor</squote> ones &mdash; the appearance of the
figure 8 in place of the apostrophe and of m for the comma. This last
always seems to me like a self-deprecatory clearing of the throat, a
rudimentary ahem, as if to suggest that all man8s thought is
improvisedm and should not be taken too seriously.
   <p>Of all the words thrown up by my typewriter I have yet to see one
more real and significant than bunkrapt. Everybody knows what
ordinary bankruptcy is, and the gloomier vommentators often speak of
<squote>the bankruptcy of our civilisation</squote>. Now vivilization can never
really be bankrupt; the very word suggests that vivilized man is
vivified, alive &mdash; and as long as he8s alice there8s hope. It is
mere defeatism to say that our vicilization is bankrupt; but once,
by means of the typewriterm we have isolated this voncept of
bunkraptcy, we are like Bright and Hodgkinm isolating and naming
those diseases which bear their names. We are half-way, if not to
curing, at least to vuring it.
   <p>For what is bunkraptcy but the state of being rapt by bunk,
entranced by rubbish, absorbed by frovilous unreality? A bunkrapt
is, surely, a man who sits for hours staring at TC, or reading
newspapers filled with gissop volumns retailing the acticities
(too often extramartial) of worthless nenontities such as acrots
and catresses, film srats and coroners. There is an invurable
fricolity about a bunkrapt, a refusal to face up to reality; the
full stature of man is diminished in him. After all it's no good
pretending the world isn8t real. It's only too lear.
   <p>But in our vicilization any man who faves up to the real
world is pat to be dubbed <squote>square</squote>. There is real danger to the
civilization of the Wets here. It is no good simply sneering at the
Russians for being <squote>puranitical</squote> when actually they are simply
more teun with the lear facts of life than we are. Unless we
pukk up our socks the Russiansm the <squote>squares</squote>, will have the
kast kaugh; and very unpleasant it wikk sound.
   <p>What is to be done, then? I would suggest, now we have found the
word for what is wrong with us, that there is a way out without being
purinatical or <squote>quares</squote>. Why do we not treat bunkraptcy
precisely as we treat bankruptcy? Let us have a Bunkraptcy Vourt,
before which persons who had gone bunkrapt would have to appear.
But the proceedings would be medical as well as legal. Bunkraptcy
is a disease as well as a crime, and would have to be treated partly
as crime was terated in Samuel Butler's Nowhere &mdash; i.e.
medivally.
   <p>It should not be difficult to work out a set of standard tests
for determining a man's Reality Quotient (RQ), analogous to the
IQ tests. After all, many psychoolgists spend their whole
lives working out tests named after themselves. The tests should take
into account a man8s whole being, not just his tastes in
entertainment. A baker, let us saym would score so many points for
doing a real job that for him to read or view bunk would not be nearly
so serious as for a stockbroker, engaged in a job that is
fundamentally unlear, nothing to do with making or fashioning
anything except money. A stockbroker would lose heavily for reading
fricolous newspapers. Anyone with children reasonably well brought
up would have a head start. But a serious person who read no bunk at
all wouldn8t come off too well; the thing is not to be rapt by
it.
   <p>The legal side of the Bunkraptcy Vourt would consist in the
fact that a person with a RQ below the statuotry mimunim
would be registered as an induscharged bunkrapt, not allowed to
take any part in public life until, after attendance at a
Herabilitation Centre, he had upgraded his RQ.
   <p>
   <p>Some may think that this would be starting from the wrong end,
that personal Bunkraptcy is an inevitable, unblameable response to
living in an over-complex, fractured society in which even the
creative ratists who set the tone of our cicikization are no
longer all-round totally real men like Shakespeare; they are men who
exclusively, intensely mebody one snigle facet of life, such as
dismebodied intellect (Shaw), misonygy (Stringberd), historical
pattern (Tonybee), sexaul feredom (Lawrence. Only a bunkrapt
vicilization could have made such an extraordinary cause
v&egrave;lebre of Lady Chattelrey's Lover). This may be so. But if
writers hace changed the worldm may not typewriters change it
also? M?
<head>The Obliviscents</head>
   <p>HOW CURIOUS England will be in fifty years' time, when every
fair-sized town has a university, doubtless interconnected by
motorways, and everyone under twenty-five is a student, belonging
to that Union (ideally the motorways would have a special lane for
dons &mdash; a tutorway &mdash; so as to make these increasingly scarce men
rapidly available to several universities). People like me, who spend
their whole lives trying not merely to keep the facts within a subject
separate (answer quickly now, what are a full cadence, a half-cadence,
a plagal cadence, a false cadence?) but to prevent the subjects
themselves from merging into a comfortable academic dreamland, nothing
to do with actual life, will be even worse off than we are now. How
shall we possibly hold up our heads among all these students, on whom
these universities will have acted like hypo, fixing for ever the
clear photographic images, bright, separate, distinct, that we all had
at the height of our powers, when we were sixteen? (Hypo what?
Hypochloride. Hyposulphate? Hypocrite? You see what I mean.)
   <p>There ought to be a word for us: obliviscents, people who forget.
Of course, everyone forgets; but obliviscents are people who try not
to, who worry about it. The other day the word Mardonius popped
into my head from nowhere. I couldn't for the life of me remember
whether he was Greek or Persian, although I could remember writing
an essay about him at school. But surely it isn't all or nothing,
must we admit that all that effort is as if it had never been? Was it
not something, at least, to know he was B.C., and not, for
instance, a Roman? So I clung to this shadowy Mardonius,
simultaneously a hard, noble Greek soldier and a soft, curling-lipped
Persian tyrant; bearded and clean-shaven; on both sides at once, a
faint ghost-Mardonius in the sky; a potentiality, only half-real.

<head>16</head>
<head>CHINESE GEESE</head>
   <p>EARLY in our occupation of Pond Cottage, when it was yet
scarcely homely, I heard another and uglier noise. It was the voices
of two geese, and they were to plague us for many a month. Looking
out of my bedroom window in the early light I observed these lovely
birds floating lightly on the water's surface and giving off at
intervals a colourable imitation of a klaxon-horn. Inquiry revealed
that they were the property of one of my neighbours, whose custom it
was to give them the freedom of the water at frequent intervals. They
were of the kind called Chinese geese but they were far from
inscrutable. They were vile in temper, dreadful bullies and cowards,
noisy in and out of season, and, as I have said, really beautiful. It
seemed surprising to me that so much that was objectionable should
reside in such a lovely source.
   <p>An inquiry of their owner, a calm man who seemed unmoved by their
clamour, as parents enjoy the crying of their children, revealed the
excellent news that, though he had hoped for better things, they were
both females and unlikely on that account to produce young of their
kind. I realized that I had had a fortunate escape when he also added
that they were the only two survivors of a brood of eight. <squote>Terribly
delicate, they are, as chicks</squote>, he said, and it was, I dare say, too
much to hope that this delicacy would persist into adult life. It was
perhaps evidence of their unabatable vitality that during the two
years I knew them they produced, and brooded upon, infertile eggs of
very large size in considerable numbers, one of which the owner
presented to me <squote>for my breakfast</squote>.
   <p>Now either I had to live with them, a nearly impossible
proposition, since every time I put my head over the hedge they
produced a series of loud metallic cries, or I had to get rid of them.
Actually the latter was my only course since they had already decided
either to attack or hoot at all comers. Their technique was to rush
at you, and they were not small birds, heads lowered and outstretched,
and uttering their offensive cries so loudly that they could be (and
in fact they were) heard a mile off. If you stood your ground they
came to a stop and sidled off in another direction.
   <p>How could I dispose of them? I had to do it without offence to
their owner &mdash; who, as I say, was a peaceable, decent chap &mdash; but I had
also another hurdle to jump. Just along the road lived a local animal
lover, who had already eyed me suspiciously when I had moved on the
several cats who, in various degrees of decrepitude, were mothered by
her. I began my campaign by the usual shooing process. This merely
amused the geese. They appeared to look elsewhere, indeed, until I
realized afresh, as you have to, that all birds look at you from the
sides of their heads. They might sail a couple of yards away, drawing
themselves up to the highest points of their dignity, but they would
immediately and in unison, as if from a radio signal, veer around and
make back to the place from which their manoeuvre had begun. Arm
waving produced no results except to incite them to guttural grunts of
derision.
   <p>I must admit that I thought of many desperate measures: of going
out at night with an airgun; of throwing poisoned bread upon the
waters (which would have been useless since, unlike moorhens, they did
not take to bread, and appeared to subsist on a diet of grass). My
alarm was increased by my reference to a book on pet keeping which
confirmed my worst fears about Chinese geese. It actually warned pet
keepers against the wisdom of attempting to keep both Chinese geese
and friendly neighbours. I presented the book to their owner but if
he read that passage it did not affect his behaviour.
   <p>In fairness to myself I must add that I had no wish to hurt the
geese. It had to be psychological warfare, mental cruelty. In the
end I decided that a process of steady discouragement was the only
policy. Whenever they appeared on the pond, and I was present, I
threw a sprinkle of small grit around them. At first they exhibited
no emotion apart from comical surprise. I persisted in this
sprinkling campaign for nearly a whole winter, not without success.
As spring approached they appeared less and less, and indeed on
seeing me they would, without undue haste, turn around and retreat to
whence they came.
   <p>For a time an intermittent peace reigned on the pond. If other
terrors arising from the pond population came and went (as, for
instance, the day my wife saw a large rat walk slowly across our
bridge towards the front door, or the sudden surprise of beady
shrew-eyes from the pond's grass banks), at least we had seemingly rid
ourselves, without offending anyone openly, of our Chinese geese.
Between whiles a charming bevy of about a dozen white (and more or
less silent) geese occasionally trooped down the village street,
fluttered and splashed in the pond for a while and then, in solemn
dignified file, returned to their drier quarters. They should have
been grateful to me, for when the Chinese geese were about they had no
difficulty in hounding off these peaceful creatures.
   <p>If this chapter reads like a successful rout, I am sorry to have
given you the wrong impression. Those Chinese geese finally fooled me
and everyone else. In May, in our second Pond Cottage summer, these
two geese returned, and with them, unaccountably, there shuffled to
the water's edge a clutch of six chicks, faintly yet assuredly
resembling their parents. That was one of the turning points of my
life as a pond-dweller.
<head>17</head>
<head>PARISH PUMP</head>
   <p>RUMOUR had had it for some years past that water &mdash; a parish
supply as it is called &mdash; was on its way to Wilborough. The supply of
water to remote villages and hamlets is one of the beneficent
functions performed in this rather deplorable century. In villages it
marks the end of water as a precious liquid, to be dispensed frugally,
weighed out drop by drop.
   <p>Living at Pond Cottage I had been able to appreciate my own ample
supplies while viewing the bucket-dipping villagers from my window.
There were periods when I was amazed at the rareness of their visits
to the spring &mdash; yet it could not be denied that the villagers were
clean people, even shining clean. Those who had lived in the heart of
the countryside will know that, in the sense of grubbiness, as opposed
to good, clean dirt, it is not easy to get dirty. When we first lived
in the country my wife worried as to who would clean our windows. We
searched around for a window-cleaner, but she need not have worried.
When we left that cottage two years later the windows, though never
touched, were as clean as when we came in.
   <p>If the country air is good for complexions and windows it must
also be marvellously disinfectant. The amount of waste of one kind
and another that has to be destroyed or concealed in any village has
to be thought about to be believed. In villages &mdash; of the thatched
variety &mdash; it is not safe to light a bonfire to burn rubbish. In most
cases it is consigned to the kindly, effacing earth; in others
chickens and birds are the agents of disposal. Where the material is
indestructible, well, every village has its dumping ground, its
ancient pits &mdash; and now and again, as we know, there is luckily a pond
or stream.
   <p>One day the surveyors arrived. They paused long outside Pond
Cottage to decide the line of pipes, and they eyed the pond itself
with glances made up equally of anxiety and animosity. This was their
lowest point, and after the spanning of our little valley they could
once more rise. The village was full of depressing rumours. They
would drain the pond; they would run pipes across the arches of the
little bridge; and so on. Fortunately the plans of the water
engineers lay elsewhere. With a mechanical digging monster, eating up
earth and rocks with equal ease, they dug a deep trench on the side of
the road furthest from the pond's edge.
   <p>To the barely suppressed satisfaction of most of us the
excavation immediately filled with water, and thereafter the scene
became a morass: ditch, ruts, mud, grey-brown hillocks of earth, large
stones, untidy clods of grass, with a few pieces of newspaper and some
old cement bags thrown in for good measure. It remained thus for a
whole summer.
   <p>An attempted laying of pipes began. A small pump arrived and
cleared the trench of water long enough for the pipes to be set in
position. Then the water once more resumed its engulfing sway. So
that the ditch could be cleared sufficiently of water for sealing the
joints, a more delicate job, the little petrol pump was again conjured
to work valiantly &mdash; but it proved unequal to its task. The trench
remained obstinately full; the water seeped in as fast as it was
pumped away. For some weeks the matter remained thus, while the
supervisors, who occasionally arrived in shining saloon cars,
scratched their heads over the problem.
   <p>The impasse was finally broken one rainy Saturday. A man-sized
pump arrived borne upon the platform of a lorry. It was this pump
which was to prove the major enemy, and not the water. Anyone who has
ever had to deal with a Diesel or petrol engine will know the
possibilities of trouble here. They are bad enough on a hot afternoon
with a lawn-mower. These men went through all the known processes to
the point of exhaustion. The engine started, stopped, started,
stopped again, always for no apparent reason. The four men concerned
explored all possibilities and experienced every feeling from hope to
despair. They cajoled, wheedled, entreated, tinkered. Eventually
they knocked off for a smoke and a cup of tea.
   <p>This campaign proceeded for an entire morning. I was amazed at
the workmen's stolid patience. Then as we were all giving up in
despair, for I shared their experience from my window, the pump
started and continued genially as if it too had had enough and wanted
to perform its task and get home for the day. Once going, the job was
tidied up, the trench filled, in less than an hour; and the landscape
settled into the condition of quiet waiting which had been its role
through the ages. Soon the grass would grow again over the trench and
over the piped water of the twentieth century.
   <p>About a month later a number of workmen came through the village
and, with the active co-operation of the villagers, made little
right-angled connections with the main pipe to each front door taking
the water. This was a job soon dispatched although fraught with small
obstacles in the way of trickles of springs beneath the road surface.
It remained then for the villagers to take the water indoors. On a
fine spring morning came the news by post from the rural district
council that water would be put into pipes on a particular date, and
that supplies could then be delivered. On that day a villager in a
cottage turned a tap &mdash; and the utility of Wilborough Pond was, after a
thousand years, ended. Thereafter it became a piece of the landscape.
   <p>I had a sign written, taking the first Saxon mention of the
village. I hung it on our gate: THIS POND, FOR A THOUSAND YEARS,
PROVIDED WATER TO THE VILLAGERS OF THIS HAMLET A.D. 888-1957.
<head>18</head>
<head>CHAIN OF LIFE</head>
   <p>STEADY effort for nearly two years, punctuated by bursts of
great energy, had been put to the end of making the pond and its
cottage a piece of landscape such as you read about or see in a film:
a veritable picture.

   <p>All new equipment takes a bit of getting used to. It was some
time before one's spoon became a weapon of relative precision and the
pudding finished up in one's mouth instead of in one's right ear or on
the wall behind one. Gloves, hairbrushes, lavatories &mdash; pretty well
all the accessories of everyday life &mdash; were unmanageable to begin
with; but in that distant era one received patient and elaborate
coaching in their use.
   <p>Middle age has no mentors; nobody says, <quote>No, not like that,
dear. Like this.</quote> I defy anyone who puts on a pair of
spectacles for the first time not to feel that he has done it in a
slightly ridiculous way. And so, in all probability, he has, as,
grasping the fragile contraption in both hands, he fastens it
uncertainly on his face like a man putting on a false beard at some
ghastly rout. Not since &mdash; in something of the same surreptitious,
apprehensive manner &mdash; he smoked his first cigarette has he been so
unexpectedly reminded that there is a right way and a wrong way of
doing things.
   <p>
   <p>Once having lodged upon his nose what he used scornfully to call
gig-lamps, he makes a long, searching scrutiny of his reflection in
the mirror. There can be no doubt that he looks extremely odd. Life
has played a practical joke on him, but it is an obscure rather than
an unkind practical joke. Although he still regards spectacles as
per se faintly ridiculous (why else do we say bespectacled &mdash;
cf. begrimed, bedizened and besotted &mdash; and not betrousered or even
bebearded?), he persuades himself that he looks no sillier than
he looked before. Rather, indeed, the reverse. A certain \gravitas
has been added. He finds himself for the first time wondering
whether he might not have had a considerable future as a dentist, or
in the Treasury.
   <p>But he has still to present this new persona to the world,
and face the world's reactions. Way back, when similar ordeals were
undergone, no pains were spared to allay his misgivings and boost his
morale. <quote>But, darling, you look so nice in it! Doesn't he, Nanny?
It's awfully becoming. All the other little boys at the party
will be wearing &mdash; well, the same sort of thing only I expect not so
nice. I promise you they will.</quote> None of this nonsense now.
   <p>He knows what he will get from his children. The spectacles
confer, in his view, a patriarchal air; they delicately underline the
eventual need for petits soins; he can almost feel the rug
round his knees, smell the aroma of the cocoa simmering on the hob.
(The blacksmith should be able to knock up a hob.) But he knows what
he will get from his children, and he gets it.
   <p><quote>Daddy!</quote> they scream, convulsed with laughter. <quote>What are
you up to? Why are you wearing spectacles? You do look
funny!</quote>
   <p>A rat caught in a gin-trap by one leg will often gnaw the leg
off. To disembarrass your face of spectacles involves a simpler, far
less drastic process; but if you have never done it before it is
difficult to do it as though to the manner born. You cannot lay your
ears back; you do not show the whites of your obsolescent eyes. But
your face, emerging from between the shafts, inevitably reflects the
part-rebellious, part-apprehensive, part-apologetic expression of an
old saddle-horse which has not previously worn harness. Once you have
expunged from their minds the idea that you are dressing up in order
to amuse them, your new gimmick can be explained to your children; but
it cannot be airily explained, any more than it can to your
over-facetious or over-solicitous contemporaries.
   <p>I had hardly obtained a pair of spectacles when I ceased to need
them, my eyes suddenly getting a second wind. This reprieve (which
for all I know is a common occurrence) began soon after one of my
aunts recommended yeast to me as a cure for failing memory. My memory
is appalling. I shovelled down the unexpired portion of my aunt's
yeast-ration &mdash; this was at the breakfast-table &mdash; and continued for a
time to eat the stuff. Post, I suspect, rather than
propter hoc I threw away my reading glasses; my memory
continued to deteriorate.
   <p>Two or three years later a minor military campaign in Arabia
strengthened the delusion that for me spectacles were a thing of the
past. So refulgent was the sun, and so few the place-names on our
unreliable maps, that I snapped my fingers at Salisbury Plain and the
deep misgivings aroused upon it.
   <p>But now &mdash; grateful for a reprieve none the worse for a dummy
run &mdash; I am once more, when I read, bespectacled.
<head>THE MAN WE KILLED</head>
   <p>One of us is a Cabinet Minister. One of us died of drink last
month. One of us is an earl. One committed suicide many years ago.
One, I think, is an expert on Russia. One is an admiral. Some I
have forgotten altogether. Several others must be dead.
   <p>The man we killed was called Mr Jackson. He was a master at
our private school towards the end of the First War. I do not
remember him as clearly as I should; one reason for this is that he
did not last long.
   <p>I suppose he was about twenty-five. He had reddish hair which
stood up over his forehead in a quiff. He wore spectacles with metal
rims and a blazer with a crest on the breast pocket. He was very
short-sighted and we believed him to make matters worse by not
cleaning his spectacles. He had a plaintive, rather common voice and
a lolloping gait. He took the Sixth Form in (I think) Greek; I am
ashamed that I cannot remember his subject with certainty.
   <p>Mr Jackson was, I suppose, fairly typical of the sort of
material with which headmasters have to make up their staffs in the
closing stages of a major war. All I can recall about his previous
career is that it had taken him to Singapore, where, he told us, the
natives played football with bare feet. He had served as a special
constable during disturbances in the city, and was easily encouraged
to relate his memories of those stirring times. They were not
sensational; once Mr Jackson had been on duty all night and it had
rained without stopping.
   <p>It would be interesting to know how many hours or days or weeks
in the school year are lost to learning by boys inducing masters to
embark on martial or other reminiscences. In my time at Eton there
was a French master &mdash; and he really looked like a French master &mdash;
called M. Larsonnier, who had served with the French contingent
which helped to sack Peking after the Boxer Rebellion. If you could
only get him started, he had a splendid set-piece. <quote>Who was ze
first into ze Forbidden City? It was I! Who was ze first into
ze Winter Palace? It was I! Who was ze first into ze Empress
Dowager's bedroom? It was I!</quote> <quote>And who</quote> (we would wittily chime
in) <quote>was ze first into ze Empress Dowager's bed?</quote> I
imagine that less time is wasted in this way at girls' schools.
   <p>Mr Jackson never had a chance. It was not merely that he had
no authority and was easily gulled; school-masters of this more or
less helpless kind generally arouse in their tormentors a sort of
mercy or tolerance, based perhaps on the feeling that if they are
handled too barbarously they will be replaced by some sterner fellow
and there will be no more cakes and ale.
   <p>But for some reason we actively disliked Mr Jackson, who had a
cocksure manner and a grating personality, and we gave him the full
treatment. Our school was near the coast, and soon after he arrived,
Mr. Jackson, jaded no doubt by the enervating climate of the
tropics, was heard to speak in appreciative terms of the sea-breezes
which stole into his bedroom. We took the first opportunity of
wedging a bloater under the springs of his mattress.
   <p><quote>Good morning, sir. Lovely fresh breeze this morning, isn't
there? You'd never think we were a mile from the sea, would you,
sir?</quote>
   <p>Mr. Jackson would concur in a baffled way.
   <p>At length masters with adjacent bedrooms were impelled to
investigate, and the putrescent bloater was removed.
   <p><quote>Good morning, sir. Did you see that perfectly beastly case in
the paper, sir? No, sir, not that one; after all, there's nothing
specially unpatriotic about murder. We meant the case where the
man was fined for hoarding food. I do think that sort of thing is
absolutely rotten when there's a war on, don't you, sir?
Apparently he used to hide it in his bedroom&hellip; . </quote>
   <p>And so on. Our worst excesses are lost in oblivion, but my
recollection is that we kept up a relentless pressure and that Mr.
Jackson ceased to be cocksure and became jumpy, irritable and
maladjusted.
   <p>
   <p>In the only incident I remember clearly, indeed vividly, I played
the leading part. Mr. Jackson was the sort of master who impels
boys, once they have established an ascendancy over him, to see how
much further they can go, and one day I decided to take a grass-snake
into his class.
   <p>We wore, in the summer, grey sweaters and grey flannel shorts. I
put the grass-snake, which was about three feet long but used to being
handled, in my pocket and kept my hand over it as a precaution. It
had had a feed a few days before and at first observed a perfect
decorum.
   <p>After a bit I became over-confident and relaxed my vigilance.
The snake got its head up my sleeve and began to climb up my arm.
Readers who have been in this particular situation will know that,
once a serpent has started climbing up your arm under your sleeve, it
matters little how much of the serpent is left in your pocket; you
cannot get it back into the pocket by using the arm it is climbing up,
and you cannot bring your other hand into play against it without
taking your sweater off, which &mdash; leaving snakes and schoolmasters out
of it &mdash; I defy anyone to do with one hand in his pocket.
   <p>Being at the top of the class, I sat directly underneath Mr.
Jackson's beaky nose. I was in a quandary. Seventyfive per cent. of
the snake had not yet passed the start-line and was still in my
pocket. I decided to try to stabilise this situation and gripped it
convulsively round what, if it had been me, would have corresponded to
its chest.
   <p>The snake cannot be blamed for failing to understand my motives.
It felt thwarted, and began to hiss. Human beings, when they hiss,
hiss outwards; a grass-snake makes a sound exactly like a human being
drawing his breath sharply inwards while stitches are being taken out
of a wound.
   <p><quote>Strix,</quote> asked Mr. Jackson, peering down at me, <quote>are you in
pain?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, sir,</quote> I said. I thought it prudent to let go of the
snake. It stopped hissing but went on climbing.
   <p>My urgent duty now was to prevent it doing what, if left to
itself, it would do, which was to make a bid for freedom by wriggling
out through the collar of my sweater. By this time, the snake's rear
echelon having left my pocket, I had both hands free and was easily
able, by clasping them to my throat in a rather precious manner, to
deny it egress. The snake turned south, towards my midriff.
   <p>It now had room to manoeuvre and was moving well; there was
nothing to do but to grab it before it escaped from my sweater. I
clasped one hand to my stomach and got it round the neck. It started
hissing again.
   <p><quote>What is the matter?</quote> asked Mr. Jackson irritably. <quote>Is
something hurting you?</quote> My bosom was heaving convulsively, on
account of the snake.
