   <p>He opened the door and at first she saw nothing but fat,
disordered mail-sacks, with another closed door beyond where she
guessed the sorter was at work.
   <p>One of the men kicked a sack aside as he entered and she saw
something else &mdash; a pair of feet jutting out from behind the bags &mdash; the
guard.
   <p><quote>Where's the registered stuff?</quote> said one of the men.
   <p>The man with the keys jerked his thumb towards the closed door.
   <p><quote>In there, with the sorter.</quote>
   <p><quote>All right. Open up.</quote>
   <p>One man was guarding Joyce closely. She kept trying to tell
herself that this wasn't really happening. That she wasn't involved
in violence and robbery.
   <p>The inner door was unlocked and flung open. A man in
shirt-sleeves, working at a sorting rack, turned to stare.
   <p><quote>Look out!</quote> Joyce cried.
   <p>A hand clamped over her mouth. She was jerked backwards so
painfully that her spine was jarred.

<text id=LOBN18>
   <p>SHE HAD TO DECIDE QUICKLY WHICH MAN TO TRUST &mdash; AND SHE CHOSE
THE WRONG ONE!
<head>THE NIGHT SHE CAUGHT THE LAST TRAIN HOME</head>
   <p>SHEILA FARRELL, waiting for the last train home, wasn't
happy about the way the Teddy boy kept eyeing her. After the past
hectic hours at her girl friend's twenty-first birthday party, she
felt as flat as a deflated balloon. She wished that the train would
hurry up.
   <p>The Teddy boy glanced at the station clock.
   <p><quote>Train's late,</quote> he said.
   <p>Sheila was about to answer automatically when she realised what
she was doing. She turned her head away uneasily.
   <p>The stranger wasn't put off. He tried again, sliding along the
seat towards her.
   <p><quote>Going far? I'm for Pulfern Green, myself.</quote>
   <p>He hesitated, then plunged on. <quote>Don't I know you? I'm sure
I've seen you before. Do you get this train often?</quote>
   <p>What a corny line, Sheila thought, her heart thumping.
   <p>A quick glance round told her that they might as well have been
the only two people in the world. There wasn't another soul to be
seen, not even a porter.
   <p>Would the Teddy boy follow her when she got on the train?
   <p>Sheila gave him a cold stare, rose to her feet and moved along
the deserted platform, feeling lonely and afraid.
   <p>Oh, how she wished she could have stayed the night at her
friend's!
   <p>If it hadn't been her dad's week for night shift, her mum
wouldn't have minded. As it was, Mum couldn't stand being alone in
the house at night, and Sheila had promised that she'd catch the last
train.
   <p>The approaching train made her jump nervously, although it was a
relief to hear it.
   <p>It drew noisily to a halt. Sheila entered an empty carriage and
moved down the aisle towards its far end.
   <p>She settled herself in a dark corner, every nerve strained,
listening intently. It wasn't until the train pulled out and she felt
certain that nobody had entered the carriage, that she relaxed.
   <p>She yawned, slipped off her shoes and, stretching out her legs,
lay full-length along the seat.
   <p>
   <p>BY the time the train had pulled into the next station,
Sheila was in a half doze.
   <p>She was shocked awake, nerves leaping, at the sound of a carriage
door being opened nearby. She lay still, waiting, her hands gripping
her handbag.
   <p>She could see the emergency chain just above her head and hoped
that she wouldn't have to use it. When she heard several men's voices
she felt relieved, and relaxed again.
   <p>A gruff voice rose from the next compartment.
   <p><quote>No, there ain't nobody in this carriage. I looked as it
pulled up. You don't get a lot of people travellin' at this time o'
night. That's why I thought it 'ud be safer.
   <p><quote>We've got to get to the Green tonight or else... Them rozzers
is gettin' too hot for comfort. We'll have to lay low, or it's
curtains for us, mate!</quote>
   <p>Sheila shivered. Had she jumped out of the frying pan into the
fire?
   <p>A different voice, younger and nervous, began:
   <p><quote>What if the ticket bloke remembers us? 'Ow do you know 'e
ain't ringing the rozzers right now? We'll likely be met by...</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, stop your whinin'!</quote> interrupted the gruff voice. <quote>We'll
be met all right. Fred's meeting us with 'is car. There won't be any
trouble unless you lose yer 'ead...</quote>
   <p>The voice dropped menacingly.
   <p>Sheila's hazel eyes widened. She drew back into the corner,
trying to make herself as small as possible.
   <p>She listened to every movement that the men made, all her nerves
alert. The slightest sign that they were coming her way and she would
have to pretend to be asleep.
   <p>As the train drew into another station, she realised, with
thankfulness, that the next one was hers.
   <p>She listened unwillingly, as Gruff Voice continued the
conversation.
   <p><quote>See what I mean? Nobody there, either. The train's deserted
at this time of night.
   <p><quote>Len and Busk got away. They're making for the north. If they
get picked up, they won't grass. They know better than that.</quote>
   <p><quote>What about Fred? D'ye think he's safe?</quote>
   <p><quote>Fred?</quote> scoffed the gruff voice. <quote>As safe as houses. If we
make it worth his while, we can stop there for a week or so, then move
on down to the coast.
   <p><quote>Those blokes at the bank don't know what hit 'em. They'll
never be able to recognise us. What are ye gonna do with your
lolly?</quote>
   <p><quote>Buy a car. Get some fun before it runs out. I like blondes
best. Saw a smasher the other day. She wouldn't look at the likes of
me, though, unless I'd plenty of lolly to spend on her.</quote>
   <p><quote>You and your blondes!</quote>
   <p>A coarse laugh drowned the other's reply, and sent shivers down
Sheila's back.
   <p>Surely they were nearly at her station by now? How was she going
to get out so that the men wouldn't realise she'd heard them?
   <p>She knew just how dangerous her position was. That gruff voice
had no mercy in it.
   <p>
   <p>WITH mixed feelings of relief, Sheila saw the lights of her
station come into view. Very gently she slid out of her seat and
round to the carriage door. She eased back the catch and held it
steady as the train pulled up.
   <p>She got out, and was beginning to close the door when she saw
that the next one was opening, and a man's startled face was gazing at
her.
   <p>In mounting panic, Sheila turned and fled down the deserted
platform. Thudding feet started after her.
   <p>She raced for the exit, her mind searching desperately for a way
of escape. She'd got to get to the police, somehow.
   <p>There was no sign of a porter. Instead, a well-dressed,
dependable-looking man stood near the exit.
   <p>Sheila made up her mind quickly.
   <p><quote>Please, please help me!</quote> she said urgently. <quote>I've just
overheard two crooks on the train, and I must get to the police. I'm
sure they know I've overheard them, and they're coming after me.</quote>
   <p>The stranger looked at Sheila oddly for a moment, hesitated as
though making up his mind, then propelled her out of the exit towards
a waiting car.
   <p>As he did, the two men burst out into the quiet street and
pounded up to them. The stranger stood quietly, waiting for them.
   <p>Then it dawned on Sheila who he was.
   <p><quote>Fred!</quote> she gasped in horror.
   <p>As Sheila tried to dodge past them, her heel caught in the
pavement and she stumbled forward.
   <p>She managed one cry for help before a hand closed over her mouth.
   <p>A voice snarled in her ear, <quote>Keep still, or else...</quote>
   <p>Sheila was bundled into the car. There she sat, squashed between
the two men, heart pounding wildly with fear.
   <p>The younger man looked her over admiringly.
   <p>Sheila shivered.
   <p><quote>OK, Fred,</quote> said the burly man. <quote>Take it away.</quote>
   <p>Sheila stared at the silent man's back. She'd picked the wrong
man. But how could you tell which man to trust and which to avoid?
   <p>She'd gone for the nice face and clothes and she'd been
hopelessly wrong. First the Teddy boy... the Teddy boy! He'd had a
nice voice behind all that talk-gimmick. But she hadn't given him a
chance after the first sight of his clothes.
   <p>Suddenly, there came a gleam of hope. He'd said that he was
going to Pulfern Green, her station. Had he got off here? Could he
have seen anything? Would he act on it if he had?
   <p>Sheila looked back as the car turned out of the street, but saw
no one.
   <p>Nobody spoke. At last, Sheila could stand it no longer.
   <p><quote>Where are you taking me?</quote> she burst out. <quote>What are you
going to do with me? Please let me go. I won't say a word, I promise
you. My mother's waiting for me, and she's alone and she'll be so
upset. Please let me go!</quote>
   <p><quote>Well now, ain't that a pity? Her mummy's waiting up for
her.</quote>
   <p>Gruff Voice grinned nastily, then his voice altered cruelly.
   <p><quote>You got yourself into this &mdash; nobody asked you to listen to our
talk. You've heard enough to get us put away, so you've got to be put
in a safe place. See?</quote>
   <p>With the last word, he took her wrist and gave it a quick twist,
making her gasp.
   <p><quote>That's just a little taste of what you'll get if you try
anything on, see?</quote>
   <p>Sheila nodded, eyes blinking back the threatening tears, as she
nursed her sore wrist.
   <p>
   <p>THE car drew up beside a large, detached house. Sheila was
bundled out, propelled along a passage, and pushed into a room.
   <p><quote>Yer stay there till we decide what to do with you!</quote> Gruff
Voice growled. <quote>And make no mistakes &mdash; if I hears a peep out of you,
you're for it!</quote>
   <p>Then the key was turned in the lock and Sheila was alone.
   <p>She gave way to tears of hopelessness.
   <p>As the tears relieved her immediate tension, Sheila realised
everything had gone quiet in the house. She supposed that they were
having a meal &mdash; they certainly weren't bothering about her.
   <p>As she sat there, she was suddenly aware of a tapping at the
window. She went over.
   <p><quote>Who is it?</quote> she said nervously. <quote>Who &mdash; who's there?</quote>
   <p>She could only just make out the whispered reply, but it filled
her with unbelievable hope.
   <p>The voice said:
   <p><quote>Have you been kidnapped?</quote>
   <p>At her answer the unknown voice went on:
   <p><quote>I was the chap who spoke to you at the main-line station, but
you wouldn't have anything to do with me, remember? I saw you being
pushed into that car. You didn't look as if you went willingly, so I
followed on my motor bike. Thought I'd better find out for sure
whether you needed help, before I went for the police.
   <p><quote>I came round the back of the house wondering which room you
were in, when I &mdash; I heard you cry.
   <p><quote>I'm going for the cops now,</quote> the voice went on. <quote>You won't
be there much longer, if I can help it. Keep your chin up! Be seeing
you.</quote>
   <p>Sheila found herself shaking, without really knowing why.
   <p>Rather than lose all control, she turned her thoughts to the
young man who was proving such a friend in need.
   <p>What a nice person he must be to help her after the way she had
treated him at the station!
   <p>
   <p>THEN at last Sheila heard the sound of a car outside. The
sudden shrilling of the doorbell made her jump.
   <p>Presently, she heard the footsteps of the men as they clattered
downstairs.
   <p>They held a whispered conversation outside her door, then the key
turned in the lock and Gruff Voice and his accomplice entered.
   <p>The younger man was plainly scared, and the older man was cursing
under his breath.
   <p>Sheila backed away from them and managed one scream before a
scarf was thrust round her mouth.
   <p>They heard the front door being opened and Fred's voice asked,
<quote>Yes? What is it? You've got me out of bed!</quote>
   <p>Sheila's pulses leaped as she recognised the Teddy boy's voice.
   <p><quote>Excuse me, but does Mr. Smith live here?</quote>
   <p>What on earth was he playing at? Did he think he could rescue
her alone?
   <p>Fred's innocently outraged voice began, <quote>No, he doesn't!
What's the big idea...</quote>
   <p>Then came a sudden crash as the front door was thrust violently
open, and several deeper voices sounded.
   <p>The gripping hands around Sheila tightened until she could barely
breathe. As the door gave way before a brawny shoulder, she was
thrown into a struggling mass of bodies.
   <p>A fist aimed at somebody else caught her a glancing blow on the
side of the head, and she fell backwards. Another pair of hands
caught hold of her and began pulling her away from the fighting men.
   <p>She struggled weakly until a remembered voice spoke urgently to
her.
   <p><quote>Don't struggle! It's all right, now. I've brought the police
and it will soon be over.</quote>

<text id=LOBN19>
<head>A Present For General Calinga</head>
   <p>HE WAS BETRAYED &mdash; BY THE ONE MAN WHOSE LOYALTY HE HAD ALWAYS
TAKEN FOR GRANTED
   <p>
   <p>THE President continued holding the telephone to his ear
long after he knew beyond all doubt that the line had been cut. Then
he gave a despairing little sigh, returned the now useless instrument
to its cradle and sat staring with unseeing eyes at the wall opposite.
   <p>A sudden outburst of machine-gun fire from outside the Palace
caused him to shiver and rise from his chair. He began to walk
quickly towards the door. But as he reached out to turn the handle
the door opened and his aide, Major Pillar Juarez, entered.
   <p>Juarez was a young man of the slim athletic type. Unlike most of
the Air Force pilots his uniform was always immaculate, a fact which
had commended itself to the President when he had first considered
making him his personal aide.
   <p>But now the major's uniform had lost its immaculate look; it was
dusty and his right trouser leg had a large tear in it.
   <p><quote>Excellency,</quote> he said quietly before the President could
speak, <quote>you will have to leave. The rebels are closing in and the
troops we have here cannot hold out much longer. Santos has made the
Palace &mdash; and you &mdash; his main objective. He is concentrating his forces
here because once you are in his power, well, it's all over.</quote>
   <p>The President swallowed. <quote>Did you know the telephone line is
cut? Our position is hopeless.</quote>
   <p><quote>That is why you must leave here, Excellency. I have the
helicopter standing by and I'll take you down to La Plomas. General
Calinga has the city completely under control. We'll fight back from
there, Excellency. Yes, with General Calinga behind you &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't know.</quote> The President's words broke in almost
nervously. <quote>About Calinga, I mean.</quote> He shook his head. <quote>No, I'm
not at all sure of him.</quote>
   <p><quote>But Calinga is loyal to you, Excellency.</quote>
   <p><quote>Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.</quote> The President half closed his
eyes, <quote>I've had my fill of bitter disappointments since this
uprising, Juarez. So many people I'd trusted have turned against
me.</quote> He lit himself a cigarette with a jerky movement. <quote>You,
Juarez,</quote> he added, <quote>are about the only one whose loyalty I can take
for granted.</quote>
   <p><quote>You trust me implicitly, Excellency?</quote> The words came
quickly, almost sharply.
   <p><quote>I do, Juarez.</quote>
   <p><quote>But you are not absolutely certain of Calinga's loyalty?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not quite. His loyalty will depend on which way the wind is
blowing. And at present &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>So, should Calinga have decided to throw in his lot with the
rebels and I take you to La Plomas, well, I shall in effect be handing
you over to Santos?</quote> The major's words were more a statement of
fact than a question.
   <p>The President drew heavily on his cigarette. He nodded slowly at
it.
   <p><quote>So therefore you won't come with me?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p>Major Pillar Juarez slowly undid the flap of his holster. He
withdrew his revolver. He pointed it straight at the President.
   <p><quote>The helicopter is all ready,</quote> he said quietly and evenly.
<quote>You will fly to La Plomas in it.</quote>
   <p>The President stared. <quote>Juarez,</quote> he said huskily, <quote>you seem
particularly anxious to take me to Calinga. Suspiciously anxious, I
would say.</quote>
   <p>Juarez tightened his grip on the gun. <quote>You said you trusted
me.</quote>
   <p>The President nodded. <quote>I did. And I meant it. At the time.</quote>
He paused. <quote>Now I'm not so sure. I &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>All right,</quote> cut in Juarez sharply, <quote>my crew-men are already
aboard.</quote> He made a little movement with the revolver. <quote>Come,
we'll go now.</quote>
   <p>As Juarez opened the door the President suddenly started biting
at his lower lip. <quote>The helicopter,</quote> continued Juarez, <quote>is
standing in the interior gardens.</quote> The President walked slowly out
of the room; his eyes were now blinking spasmodically.
   <p>
   <p><quote>WAS it necessary to tie me up like this?</quote> The
President looked tired and old as he indicated his bound wrists.
   <p>Juarez did not answer. He turned to his radio-operator. <quote>I'm
dropping to a thousand feet,</quote> he said. <quote>Try to contact Santos
now.</quote>
   <p>The President's eyes filled with an ocean of contempt. <quote>And to
think I once gave you my trust,</quote> he choked. <quote>Much rather had I
stayed at my Palace and &mdash;</quote> He suddenly leaned forward and buried
his face in his bound hands. He started sobbing silently to himself.
   <p>For a moment Juarez contemplated the broken man beside him. He
opened his mouth to say something but as he did so his radio-operator
announced that he had contacted Santos. Juarez nodded. He took his
microphone and started talking slowly, deliberately.
   <p>After he had finished doing so he dropped the helicopter to five
hundred feet. He banked slightly. When he saw three men leave a hut
and walk out towards the middle of the field in front of it he dropped
even lower.
   <p><quote>That's Santos,</quote> pointed the radio-operator. <quote>The one in the
middle.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I know.</quote> Juarez made towards the group. He landed the
helicopter about fifty yards away from the three men. He kept the
rotor blades turning. <quote>Right,</quote> he said sharply to the President,
<quote>out you get. Santos is expecting you!</quote> He removed his gun from
its holster.
   <p>The President lifted his head. He glanced at the revolver and
also at the carbines the radio-operator and Juarez's other crew-men
were holding. His eyes started blinking again. Then slowly he rose
from his seat. He followed Juarez out of the machine like a man from
whose body the last spark of life had all but departed.
   <p>
   <p>SANTOS could not contain himself any longer: when he saw
his dejected enemy before him he started running towards the
helicopter. He was shouting almost incoherently.
   <p>It was then that the carbines opened up catching Santos's two
henchmen completely unawares; they died instantly. At the same moment
Juarez moved forward to the rebel leader. He put his gun close to the
other's stomach. He pulled the trigger five times.
   <p>Now the two crew-men had dropped their carbines. They leaped out
of the helicopter and unceremoniously tossed the dazed and bewildered
President back into it. Then, while Juarez climbed frantically for
the pilot's seat, they also tossed aboard the dead body of the rebel
leader.
   <p>As the helicopter began to rise they regained their carbines and
poured a stream of bullets at the shouting groups of men who were now
running out towards the field.
   <p>At two thousand feet Juarez set course for La Plomas. He smiled
tightly as his radio-operator leaned over and cut the bonds on the
President's wrists. <quote>Well, Excellency,</quote> he said, <quote>it was a long
shot but &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>It was indeed a long shot,</quote> interjected the President in a
strangled voice. <quote>A very long shot.</quote> He swallowed. <quote>But I am
still bewildered. Why was it necessary to force me into this
helicopter at gunpoint? And why the bonds? Why &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Excellency,</quote> said Major Pillar Juarez, <quote>I had to force you
into the helicopter because otherwise you would have stayed at your
Palace. And died. Also, with the greatest respect, Excellency, you
are a very poor actor; you cannot hide or disguise your emotions. So
I had to make you actually believe I was handing you over to
Santos.
   <p><quote>No, Excellency, you could not have played the part you did; it
had to be, as far as you were concerned, only too horribly true.
Otherwise it could not have succeeded. You did believe it &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. And I believed that you too had turned against me,
Juarez.</quote> The words were uttered as an apology as humble as it was
sincere.
   <p>Juarez smiled. <quote>Yes, you had to believe that too,
Excellency.</quote> He altered course ten degrees to starboard. <quote>La
Plomas ahead,</quote> he announced. <quote>Now when we land and you show
General Calinga the dead body of the rebel Santos, there is no doubt
where his loyalty will be, is there?</quote>
   <p>The President nodded and fell silent. About a minute later he
said: <quote>Juarez, I can never reward you enough. I &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Excellency,</quote> smiled Major Pillar Juarez, <quote>I have a wish I
hope you will grant.</quote>
   <p><quote>Name it.</quote>
   <p>The major's smile widened. <quote>A new uniform, Excellency.
Hand-tailored in English cloth.</quote> He glanced at the tear in his
trouser leg. <quote>I think I am almost entitled to that, Excellency.</quote>
   <p>The President laughed. It was the first time he had done so in
over three weeks. It was a long laugh. A slightly hysterical laugh.
<head>THE FRIEND</head>
   <p>SANTAGO WAS A MAN TO BE TRUSTED... HE COULD USE A SUB-MACHINE
GUN
   <p>
   <p>CAPTAIN RAMON CORDORA'S voice was loud. <quote>Corporal
Santago,</quote> he shouted. <quote>Where's Corporal Santago?</quote>
   <p>One of the privates looked up briefly from his cards. <quote>Back
there somewhere,</quote> he grunted.
   <p>Cordora opened his mouth again as if he were going to remonstrate
with the private for his appalling lack of discipline but, thinking
better of it, he moved off in search of Santago.
   <p>He found him behind the hut cleaning his rifle. <quote>Well,
Corporal,</quote> he smiled, <quote>I'm glad to see someone in your platoon
cleans his weapons regularly!</quote>
   <p>Santago did not answer until he had removed the piece of
four-by-two from his pull-through. <quote>I always used to clean my rifle
regularly.</quote> His voice was surly. <quote>If you made an inspection now
and then, you'd know that I still do.</quote>
   <p>Cordora continued smiling. <quote>Now, now, can't you take a little
joke, my friend?</quote>
   <p>Santago slowly raised his head. <quote>Don't you call me your
friend,</quote> he said. <quote>The only friend you have is yourself.</quote>
   <p>The other's smile remained fixed. <quote>We were friends once upon a
time.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, but that was long, long ago.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not so long ago.</quote> The Captain paused. <quote>It's only six
months since we were serving together under La Cruz.</quote>
   <p>Santago now began to examine the bolt of his rifle. <quote>Yes,</quote> he
murmured, <quote>we served together under him. As privates. Then along
came Kassan. And with him in power what happened? You became
sergeant the very next day.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> broke in Cordora, <quote>but shortly after that I was able
to get you promoted to corporal.</quote>
   <p>Santago lifted his head. <quote>True. But you also got yourself
promoted to lieutenant. Then a month later you became a captain.</quote>
He bent down once again and started cleaning his rifle bolt. <quote>Yes,
you were a good friend to yourself. But not to me. Any friend of
mine would have made sure I got a bit higher than this.</quote>
   <p>His eyes flicked contemptuously to the rank badges on his right
sleeve, then back again to his rifle bolt.
   <p>Cordora switched his smile off and managed to look sympathetic.
<quote>I know how you must feel,</quote> he said. <quote>But it's not so easy as
you'd think. I did my best for you but President Kassan has never
forgotten that day over two years ago, when you let him have the butt
of your rifle right across his face.</quote>
   <p><quote>I couldn't help it,</quote> muttered the other. <quote>I was ordered to
disperse the crowd and I was only doing my duty. How was I to know
that one day he'd be President?</quote>
   <p>Captain Cordora made a little clicking sound with his teeth.
<quote>Well, nevertheless, he's never forgotten it. And every time I've
brought up the subject of your commission, well, he has said no. In
fact, it took me a great deal of persuading to even get you your
corporal's stripes, Santago, if the truth be told.</quote>
   <p>He paused and lowered his voice. <quote>But now something's come up
which, if you do your bit, will maybe enable you to find favour in the
President's eyes.
   <p><quote>For a start, he has given me authority to promote you to
sergeant if all goes well.</quote>
   <p>Santago stopped cleaning the rifle bolt. <quote>To sergeant?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. Now, if he's prepared to forgive you enough to agree to
your promotion to sergeant, well, who knows? Maybe sometime later he
will forgive you completely and grant you a commission.</quote>
   <p>Cordora paused again. <quote>Of course, all that is conjecture. You
will have to carry out this special little job first and qualify
yourself for promotion to sergeant before the officer question could
even be considered.</quote>

<head>Destination Danger</head>
<head>By ERNEST HAYCOX</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY EDWIN PHILLIPS</head>
   <p>Bill wanted her to be his alone &mdash; despite her past. But first
he had to settle a grudge
   <p>THIS was one of those years when Apache smoke signals
spiralled from the mountain tops, when many a ranch-house lay as a
square of blackened ashes and the departure of a stage from Tonto
started an adventure that had no certain ending.
   <p>The stage, with its six horses, waited in Tonto's town square.
On the box was Happy Stewart, the reins between his fingers. John
Strang rode shotgun guard. And an escort of 10 cavalrymen waited
behind the coach, half asleep in their saddles.
   <p>In the dawn, this high air was cold. A small crowd stood in the
square, presenting their final messages to the passengers.
   <p>There was a girl going to marry an infantry officer, a tall, thin
Englishman carrying a sporting rifle, a gambler, a cattleman &mdash; and a
slim blond man. Happy Stuart and the shotgun guard looked at him
with narrow-eyed interest.
   <p>This seemed all until a girl known commonly throughout Arizona
Territory as Henriette walked from the crowd. She was small, with a
touch of paleness in her cheeks. The blond man stepped back from the
coach door and her eyes lifted at his unexpected courtesy. They
showed faint surprise.
   <p>Men in the crowd were smiling &mdash; derisively. But the blond man
turned &mdash; the movement like the swift cut of a knife &mdash; and his
sharp-bright attention covered them until the smiling quit.
   <p>He was a lean man, and stamped as a gun-fighter by the Colts
slung on his hip.
   <p>But it wasn't the guns alone. Something in his face, watchful
and smooth, showed his trade, too.
   <p>Happy Stuart kicked off the brakes and yelled: <quote>Hi!</quote> The
stage rolled from the town in a cloud of dust, the cavalrymen trotting
briskly behind.
   <p>Beyond them stretched the journey no coach had attempted for 45
days. Out below in the desert's distance stood the relay stations
they hoped to reach and pass.
   <p>Between lay a country swept empty by the quick raids of
Geronimo's savages.
   <p>The Englishman, the gambler and the blond man sat jammed together
in the forward seat. The cattleman and the two women shared the rear
seat.
   <p>
   <p>NOW the cattleman leaned towards Henriette, his knees
almost touching her. A huge gold nugget slid gently back and forth
along the gold watch chain slung across his wide chest. His eyes
looked into hers, reading something that caused him to smile.
   <p>They were strangers packed closely together with nothing in
common save a destination.
   <p>Yet the cattleman's smile and the boldness of his glance was
something as audible as speech, noted by everyone except the
Englishman, who sat bolt upright in the corner, covered by stony
indifference.
   <p>The army girl, tall and demurely pretty, threw a quick
side-glance at Henriette, then looked away with a touch of colour.
   <p>Three hours from Tonto the road, making a last round sweep, let
them down into the flat desert.
   <p>From now on they would be on their own. The cavalrymen wheeled
back to town, their sergeant yelling, doubtfully: <quote>Good luck.</quote>
   <p>The miles fell behind and the smell of alkali dust got thicker.
Up on the box, Johnny Strang shifted the gun on his lap. <quote>What's
Malpais Bill &mdash; the blond one &mdash; riding with us for?</quote>
   <p><quote>I guess I wouldn't ask him,</quote> Happy Stuart replied, &mdash; and
studied the hazy horizon.
   <p>All day they were tormented by a cruel, relentless sun. Now as
the coach trundled to a stop outside Gap Station, they were red-eyed
and aching from the stinging dust.
   <p>A short man with a tremendous stomach shuffled through the dusk.
He said: <quote>Wasn't sure you'd get through, Happy.</quote>
   <p><quote>Where's the soldiers for tomorrow?</quote>
   <p><quote>Other side of the mountains. Everybody's chased out. What
ain't forted up here was sent into Lordsburg.</quote>
   <p>He looked first at the army girl, then appraised Henriette
instantly. His eyes slid on to Malpais Bill standing in the
background. Recognition stirred him then and made his voice careful.
<quote>Hello, Bill. What brings you this way?</quote>
   <p>Malpais Bill's cigarette glowed in the gathering dusk and
Henriette caught the brief image of his face, serene and watchful.
Malpais Bill's tone was easy, it was soft. <quote>Just the trip.</quote>
   <p>They were moving on towards the frame house. As the army girl
walked into the station's big room, a soldier in a dishevelled uniform
stepped forward.
   <p>He said: <quote>Miss Robertson? Lieutenant Hauser was to have met
you here. He is at Lordsburg. He was wounded in a brush with the
Apaches last night.</quote>
   <p>The girl stood very still. She said: <quote>Badly?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, yes,</quote> said the soldier.
   <p>Henriette's dove-coloured dress blended with the background
shadows. She was watching the other girl's face whiten.
   <p>But there was a strength in the army girl, a fortitude that made
her think of the soldier. For she said quietly: <quote>You must have had
a bad trip.</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothing &mdash; nothing at all,</quote> said the soldier. As the trooper
left the room, the gambler turned to the army girl with an odd
expression, as though he were remembering painful things.
   <p>After dinner, Malpais Bill lounged, cigarette in hand, in the
yard. The moonlight was a frozen silver that could not dissolve the
desert's incredible blackness.
   <p>
   <p>AS Henriette walked towards him from the Tonto road, her
face was clear and strange and incurious in the night. He said:
<quote>Apaches like to crawl down next to a settlement and wait for
strays.</quote>
   <p>She was indifferent, unafraid. Her voice was cool, and he could
hear the faint loneliness in it, the fatalism that made her words so
even. <quote>There's a wind coming up, so soft and good.</quote>
   <p>He took off his hat, long legs braced and his eyes quick and
puzzled in their watchfulness. His blond hair glowed in the fugitive
light.
   <p>His lips were restless and the sing and rush of strong feeling
was like a current of quick wind around him. It was that unruly.
<quote>You have folks in Lordsburg?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>SHE spoke in a direct patient way as though explaining
something he should have known without asking. <quote>I run a house in
Lordsburg.</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he said, <quote>it wasn't what I asked.</quote>
   <p><quote>My folks are dead &mdash; I think. There was a massacre in the
Superstition Mountains when I was a baby.</quote>
   <p>He stood with his head bowed. There was a hardness and a rawness
to this land and little sympathy for the weak. She had survived, and
had paid for her survival and she looked at him now in a way that
offered no explanation or apologies.
   <p>He said: <quote>Over in the Tonto Basin it's fine land. I still have
a piece of a ranch there &mdash; with a house half built.</quote>
   <p><quote>If that's your country, why are you here?</quote>
   <p>His lips laughed and the rashness in him glowed hot again and he
seemed to grow taller in the moonlight. <quote>A debt to collect.</quote>
   <p><quote>You will never get through collecting those kind of debts.
Everybody in the Territory knows you.
   <p><quote>Once you were just a rancher. Then you tried to wipe out a
grudge and then there was a bigger one to wipe out &mdash; and the debt kept
growing and more men are waiting to kill you. Some day a man will.
Run away from the debts.</quote>
   <p>His bright smile kept constant, which made her shoulders lift in
resignation. <quote>No,</quote> she murmured. <quote>You won't run.</quote>
   <p>He said: <quote>We'd better go back,</quote> and they went across the yard
in silence.
   <p>She turned to look at him once more and then passed down the
narrow corridor to her own quarters.
   <p>Beyond her window in the yard, a man was murmuring to another
man: <quote>Plummer and Shanley are in Lordsburg. Malpais Bill knows
it.</quote>
   <p>Through the thin partition of the adjoining room she heard the
army girl crying with uncontrollable regularity.
   <p>Henriette stared at the dark wall, her shoulders and head bowed.
Then she returned to the hall, knocked on the army girl's door and
went in.
   <p>It was morning. Six fresh horses fidgeted in front of the coach
and the fat host of Gap Station came across the yard swinging a
lantern against the dead, bitter black. All the passengers filed
sleep-dulled and miserable from the house.
   <p>The Gap host grumbled: <quote>If they don't jump you before you get
to Al's ranch, you'll be all right.</quote>
   <p>It was noon when Henriette caught the smell of smoke in the
windless air. Looking through the angled vista of the window panel
she saw a clay and rock chimney standing up like a gaunt skeleton
against the day's light.
   <p>The house that had been there was a black square on the ground,
smoke still rising from pieces that had not been completely burned.
   <p>The stage stopped and all the men were instantly out. An iron
stove squatted on the earth, with one section of pipe stuck upright to
it. Fire licked lazily along the collapsed fragments of what had been
a trunk.
   <p>Beyond the house lay two nude figures grotesquely bald, with
deliberate knife-slashes marking their bodies. Happy Stuart walked
over and returned quickly. <quote>Al and his wife.</quote>
   <p>Malpais Bill knew now that they had a battle ahead. With Happy
and the shotgun guard he clambered on to the coach roof &mdash; ready for
the fight.
   <p>Back on the coach, the gambler said to the army girl: <quote>You're
pretty safe between two fellows.</quote> He hauled a .44 from a back
pocket and laid it on his lap.
   <p>The Englishman pulled the rifle from between his knees and laid
it across the sill of the window. The cattleman swept back his coat
to clear the gun holster.
   <p>Henriette sat with her eyes pinned to the gloved tips of her
fingers, remembering the tall shape of Malpais Bill cut against the
moonlight of Gap Station.
   <p>He had smiled at her as a man might smile at any desirable woman,
with the sweep and swing of laughter in his voice. His eyes had been
gentle.
   <p>The gambler spoke very quietly and she didn't hear him until his
fingers gripped her arm. He said again, not raising his voice: <quote>Get
down.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>HENRIETTE dropped to her knees, hearing gunfire blast
through the rush and run of the coach. Happy Stuart ceased to yell
and the army girl's eyes were round and dark, yet showing no fright.
   <p>Looking upward through the window on the gambler's side,
Henriette saw the weaving figure of an Apache warrior reel nakedly on
a pony and rush by with a rifle raised and pointed in his bony elbows.
   <p>The gambler took a cool aim. The stockman fired and aimed again.
The Englishman's sporting rifle blasted heavy echoes through the
coach, hurting her ears, and the smell of powder got rank and bitter.
   <p>The blond man's boots scraped the coach top and round small holes
began to dimple the panelling as the Apaches' bullets struck.
   <p>An Indian came boldly abreast the coach and made a target that
couldn't be missed. The cattleman dropped him with one shot. The
coach hubs screamed as its wheels slewed around the sharp ruts and the
whole heavy superstructure bounced high in the air.
   <p>The gambler said, quietly: ~<quote>You'd better take this,</quote> handing
Henriette his gun. He leaned against the door, with his small hands
gripping the sill. Pallor loosened the cheeks. He said, to the army
girl: <quote>Be sure to keep between those gentlemen.</quote> He slumped on to
the window sill.
   <p>They were rolling down the mountain without brake. Gunfire fell
off and the crying of the Indians faded back.
   <p>Coming up from her knees then, she saw the desert's flat surface
far below, with the angular pattern of Lordsburg vaguely on the far
borders of the heat fog.
   <p>
   <p>WITH a roar, Happy Stuart's voice lifted again and brakes
were screaming on the wheels, and going off, and screaming again.
   <p>The Englishman stared out of the window sullenly. The army girl
seemed in a deep desperate dream. The cattleman's face was shining
with a strange sweat.

<head>AT THAT MAN'S MERCY</head>
   <p>As Jenny lifted the receiver, an arm suddenly came over her
shoulder and a hairy hand gripped her wrist.
   <p>
   <p>NOTHING WARNED JENNY THAT THE PEACE AND QUIET OF HER LIFE WAS
TO BE SHATTERED.
   <p>
   <p>JENNY put the last of the dishes in the cupboard, and then
walked back into the living-room.
   <p>She wished Ian were back. The house always seemed very still and
quiet when he was away and he would not be home until late.
   <p>Tonight Jenny felt uneasy. That announcement on the radio about
a man who had escaped from the mental institution in a neighbouring
town had disturbed her.
   <p>She stood looking out of the wide bay-window on to the garden.
The great copper beech cast a lacework of moving shadows across the
smooth, sunlit lawn, and in its whispering branches two magpies
quarrelled noisily.
   <p>As far as the eye could see there was nothing but trees, and, in
the distance, the bleak moors, so beautiful, peaceful and isolated.
That was just what she and Ian liked, but not when there was a maniac
at large.
   <p>Jenny sat down on the settee and picked up the paper, trying to
keep calm. After all, there was no reason why he should come here.
The road past their house led only to a small secluded bay a mile or
two further on.
   <p>The reason for his escaping from the asylum was presumably to get
as far away from confinement as possible, in which case he would
naturally go in the opposite direction.
   <p>Her fears somewhat lulled, she began to read. The radio was on
and she could hear the baby upstairs whimper in his sleep.
   <p>The clock was striking six when a loud knock on the door made her
start. Slowly she lowered the newspaper. She wasn't expecting
anyone. Oh, yes, her young sister, Betty, had said she might call.
   <p>She got up and went to the front door. As she opened it, a
good-looking man wearing a grey suit, pushed past her into the hall.
She turned on him indignantly, but before she could protest, he
leaned over her shoulder and shut the door.
   <p>Her mouth went dry. A large hand gripped her arm and turned her
towards the living-room.
   <p><quote>Go on,</quote> the voice said metallically, and the protest died on
her lips as she obeyed.
   <p>She walked over to the settee, and then turned and smiled
nervously.
   <p><quote>Won't you sit down?</quote> she asked, her throat constricted.
   <p><quote>Food, have you any food?</quote> he growled, and there was a strange
glint in his eye as he looked her up and down.
   <p>She swallowed hard, her fingers fumbling nervously with her
wedding ring.
   <p><quote>I haven't got much &mdash; my husband's supper &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Her voice trailed away.
   <p>At the mention of Ian, the stranger half-rose, his eyes wary.
   <p><quote>Your husband, where is he?</quote>
   <p><quote>He'll be back soon.</quote>
   <p><quote>Give me food.</quote>
   <p>His eyes were fixed on her, and, try as she might, she could not
take her own away. There was something almost hypnotic about those
eyes, and yet something lonely &mdash; a loneliness of the spirit that was
terrifying, as though his mind were far beyond reality.
   <p>Suddenly she remembered the announcer on the radio. He had
warned anyone who met this man not to provoke him in any way. The
slightest disagreement could send him into an uncontrollable rage.
   <p>He began to rise slowly from the table.
   <p><quote>Yes, yes, I'll get you some food now,</quote> she said hastily.
   <p>Her hand found the door handle and she slipped out. In the small
alcove by the kitchen, her eyes fell on the telephone. She paused,
looking at it longingly, but a sixth sense made her glance over her
shoulder.
   <p>He was standing in the doorway. Threateningly, he began to walk
towards her. She stooped to pick up her handkerchief, and went on
into the kitchen.
   <p>As she opened the pantry door, he was there behind her. She put
bread on the table, and took the butter and a cold veal and ham pie
from the refrigerator.
   <p>He stood in the middle of the room, watching her every move.
   <p>Putting the food on a tray, she cut a piece of apple tart, and
carried it all into the living-room. Again, he followed close behind
her.
   <p>He sat down at the table and she placed the tray in front of him.
Ignoring the knife and fork, he picked up the meat pie, and, breaking
it in two, began to eat.
   <p>Jenny could feel her hands trembling, and when the man coughed,
her hand jerked, and the sauce bottle lay on its side. A brown stain
slowly spread over the cloth.
   <p>Her hand went out to pick up the fallen bottle &mdash; and froze. She
saw him stop chewing. His eyes were fixed on the spilling sauce.
Then he raised his head and she shrank back. He had the expression
of a wild cat that had been disturbed at its meal.
   <p><quote>Sorry, that was silly of me,</quote> she said, forcing a laugh.
   <p>Then she got up and moved towards the door.
   <p><quote>Where are you going? Come back.</quote>
   <p>The voice was like a whip-lash.
   <p>She closed her eyes and swayed slightly.
   <p><quote>I &mdash; I'm going to make you a cup of tea,</quote> she explained
shakily. <quote>You'd like a drink?</quote>
   <p><quote>Beer.</quote>
   <p>She left the door half-open, and, walking quietly, reached the
alcove. If she could only dial 999. Jenny glanced over her shoulder.
The door was still ajar and there was no sound, except when his hand
touched the cutlery.
   <p>Reaching out, she took hold of the receiver, and raised her left
hand to the dial. She was breathing with difficulty, and her legs
felt unsteady.
   <p>As she lifted the receiver, an arm came over her shoulder and a
hairy hand gripped her wrist. Her heart leaped and the blood pounded
in her ears. For a moment, she was paralysed with fear.
   <p>Then slowly she turned and looked up into his face. She hardly
recognised it. It was very flushed, and seemed to have grown larger.
The mouth was slightly open, and jerked spasmodically at one corner.
   <p>
   <p>HER breath came in gasps as she ran her tongue over her dry
lips. Suddenly his grip tightened and, with a gasp of pain, Jenny
dropped the receiver.
   <p>He stood, still holding her wrist.
   <p><quote>I was just going to ring the doctor to see if he was calling
tomorrow. The baby isn't too well.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're not ringing any doctor,</quote> he said thickly.
   <p><quote>All right then. Come with me, and we'll get that bottle of
beer.</quote>
   <p>She smiled at him hopefully, and he released her wrist.
   <p>Jenny took a few tentative steps forward, and then waited, her
heart pounding. Glancing out of the corner of her eye, she saw him
following. Slowly, she went into the kitchen and took a bottle of
beer out of the refrigerator.
   <p>Back in the living-room, he stood by the table as she opened the
bottle and poured out the drink. She held the glass out to him.
   <p><quote>Come on, drink it. You'll feel better.</quote>
   <p>He took the glass, looking suspiciously at it and then at her.
   <p><quote>What d'you mean, <squote>feel better</squote>?</quote> he growled. <quote>There's
nothing wrong with me.</quote>
   <p>Jenny smiled placatingly.
   <p><quote>No, of course not,</quote> she soothed, <quote>but you said you were very
thirsty. It's a good brand. My husband's very fond of it.</quote>
   <p>He looked at the label.
   <p><quote>I know it's good. I can see, can't I?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, yes, of course. I &mdash; I didn't mean to be rude.</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't say you were rude.</quote> His eyes were beginning to
glaze over. <quote>What's the matter? You think I'm mad, don't you?</quote>
   <p><quote>No &mdash; no. Why should I? Look, drink up. Have a cigarette.</quote>
   <p>She offered him the packet. He took one and examined it, his
thick fingers turning it over and over. He sniffed it, his brows
drawn together in concentration.
   <p>Jenny lit hers and watched him in amazement. Why all this fuss
over an ordinary cigarette?
   <p>She flicked her lighter and held it out. He took hold of her
wrist, bringing the flame to the cigarette. As he puffed, his hands
gripped her more tightly. His eyes met hers through the thin veil of
smoke.
   <p>Her heart pounded and she closed her eyes. That wild look of
animal desire &mdash; and he was mad. She felt utterly weary. Gently she
pulled her arm away.
   <p><quote>Oh, God, please help me,</quote> she prayed inwardly. <quote>I can't
stand much more of this.</quote>
   <p>The baby upstairs began to cry loudly, giving great hiccoughing
sobs. Then his voice rose to a scream. Jenny whipped round and raced
for the door, but the man caught her arm.
   <p><quote>Where are you going?</quote> he demanded.
   <p>His face was fierce and ugly.
   <p><quote>My baby's ill. I must see to him.</quote> She glared at him, fear
forgotten because her little son needed her. <quote>Let me go.</quote>
   <p><quote>Come here. I want you.</quote>
   <p>She took one look at his face, now a deep red, the veins bulging
on his forehead, his madness plain to see. With a desperate effort
she wrenched her arm away and dashed into the hall. She heard him
shout, and start to lumber after her.
   <p>With fear as the spur, she leapt up the stairs, the madman at her
heels. She paused for a split second, and then seizing a large
Chinese vase that stood at the turn of the stairs, she pulled it over
and sent it rolling down.
   <p>It caught him across the thighs, and man and vase crashed in a
heap at the foot of the stairs. Not waiting to see the results, Jenny
dived for the bedroom and slammed the door, turning the key. Gasping,
she leaned back against the door. Looking wildly around the room, her
eye fell on the chest of drawers. It was heavy and made of oak.
   <p>She went across and slowly began to push it over the floor.
Hearing the noise, the baby stopped crying.
   <p>At last the chest was in position. Panting, she pushed her hair
off her forehead and went over to the baby's cot. She lifted him and
laid him on the bed.
   <p>Then, picking up the cot, she carried it into the small ante-room
which led off the main bedroom. There was no other way in, except
through the bedroom. She collected the baby and laid him down in the
cot. Then she drew the curtains, and, going back into the bedroom,
closed the door.
   <p>
   <p>THERE was the muffled sound of scrambling on the stairs.
He was coming up again. She eyed the oak chest. That should hold
him off, at least for a time. She went to the extension phone by the
bed, and, with trembling hands, dialled 999. Soon she was blurting
out all the essential details to the police.
   <p>As she replaced the receiver, Jenny noticed the house was
completely silent again. Where was he now? She went as near to the
door as she could and listened intently &mdash; not a sound.
   <p>She slipped back to the bed and sat down weakly. Taking her
cigarettes out of her pocket, she lit one. Inhaling deeply, she let
her head fall forward.
   <p>Suddenly she jerked upright. That was the side door that had
creaked. He had been outside, but for what? Then nightmare visions
of things she had read in the papers flooded back to her &mdash; of people
being axed to death! Only last week, Ian had bought a new axe. She
could picture its gleaming head now.
   <p>She darted over to the window, and gazed vainly in all
directions. There was not a sight or sound of anyone &mdash; only the
sun-dappled lawn and the whispering trees. Peace was everywhere. She
smiled bitterly.
   <p>Her heart leaped at the sound of an approaching car. Running to
the window Jenny saw it sweep round the bend and pass straight on,
heading for the cove.
   <p>Again there was that awful silence &mdash; silence except for the sound
of a man with an axe, who began to stumble up the stairs.

<head>Continuing Reveille's exciting serial</head>
<head>VICE KING'S SWEETHEART</head>
<head>HIDE-AND-SEEK WITH A KILLER</head>
<head>by Douglas Enefer</head>
   <p>A glance in the driving mirror told me I was being tailed by
another car. I knew the man at the wheel. His name was Ugo
Caramello.
   <p>I had met him a few days earlier &mdash; after I had found lovely Anna
Pavone dead in Rome's famous Fountain of Trevi. He had been with
Anna's sister, Adriana, when I went to tell her the news.
   <p>Adriana had denied that her sister was dead. And Ugo had
threatened me.
   <p>Events moved rapidly after that. I had run across New York
vice-boss Frank Delgarra in Rome in the company of a call-girl, Gina
Vanoni. A few hours later I found Gina murdered &mdash; and Adriana left
for New York to collect an oil fortune she should have shared with her
sister. Helping her to collect would be her fiance, business tycoon
Lance Mallory. I followed.
   <p>I talked to Adriana in her penthouse suite. She told me her
sister had died &mdash; in a car crash. Her eyes and lips had been
inviting. But I had snubbed her and stalked out. Now watchdog Ugo
was following me. And he had a gun in his hand.
   <p>
   <p>I WAS still being tailed by Ugo Caramello in his blue Chev
when I drove downtown through Columbus-circle. He was still keeping
the sort of distance he figured necessary for me not to know I was
being followed.
   <p>But I had seen him.
   <p>At Times-square I made a sharp left turn and went down
Eighth-avenue as fast as the traffic would allow.
   <p>I had not shaken him off, but I was widening the gap. Then I
slewed into Greenwich-avenue and twisted and turned in the little side
streets with their curio shops and outdoor art shows west of
Washington-square.
   <p>When I finally ran the car into a narrow alley I knew I had
Caramello beat. I got out, walked to the mouth of the alley and stood
back under a shop awning waiting for him.
   <p>Three minutes later the blue Chev poked its nose into the street.
   <p>Ugo had his dark glasses off now and was peering around. His
dark Sicilian face was savage with annoyance.
   <p>He killed the car engine, stepped out and dodged into a corner
drugstore across the street.
   <p>I waited for a second, then drifted over the street and pushed
the drug-store doors open.
   <p>Inside four teenage kids, two boys and two girls, were drinking
cokes and chattering.
   <p>
   <p>THE counterman, a hefty lad with the shoulders of a
quarter-back, was polishing glasses with quick, deft movements.
   <p>In the middle of the store a middle-aged guy with waxed
moustaches was reading as much of a magazine as you can do without
buying the thing.
   <p>No sign of Signor Ugo Caramello.
   <p>Then I saw the telephone booth. I strolled down to the end of
the long counter and pushed my ear against the side without glass. I
could just hear Ugo's voice. It seemed a bit agitated.
   <p><quote>Is that Plaza 6-1079, please?</quote> A pause, then: <quote>Who is
speaking, please?</quote> Again a pause. <quote>This is Caramello. I follow
him but he disappear in the traffic.</quote>
   <p>Another pause. <quote>No, I do not know where he went. I &mdash; oh,
damn.</quote>
   <p>I heard the phone slam back on its rest and went fast into the
street and across to my car. I sat in it until Caramello came out and
drove off.
   <p>Then I went back into the drugstore.
   <p>The counterhand eyed me coldly. <quote>You want something, mister?</quote>
I bought a pack of cigarettes, shut myself in the telephone booth and
dialled Plaza 6-1079.
   <p><quote>Mr. Lance Mallory's residence,</quote> said a voice.
   <p>I let the receiver slide down on its cradle and went back to my
car with a head full of thoughts &mdash; none of which started to make
sense.
   <p>I drove home.
   <p>Lesley, the brown-haired girl who operates the switchboard in my
apartment block, looked up pertly as I came in.
   <p><quote>Did you have a nice time in Rome, Mr. Power?</quote>
   <p><quote>Swell.</quote>
   <p><quote>You've a good tan, but otherwise you don't look like a man
fresh back from sunny Italy,</quote> she said critically. <quote>And why aren't
you at the office?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've two more days' leave before I check in,</quote> I told her.
   <p>
   <p>GOING up to the little railing which protects her from the
harsh world, I leaned over and kissed the top of her head.
   <p><quote>I've been counting the hours to that,</quote> she said.
   <p><quote>Put your face up and I'll do better,</quote> I said recklessly.
   <p>Her smooth oval face came up directly. Her mouth was warm and a
little moist and not immobile.
   <p>Finally she moved away from me and said, briskly: <quote>A telephone
message came for you while you were out. From a Miss Adriana
Pavone.</quote>
   <p>She eyed me mockingly. <quote>So they even follow you from Italy, do
they?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, sure &mdash; I see them in rotation,</quote> I said. <quote>What did Miss
Pavone want?</quote>
   <p>Lesley tapped her small teeth with a newly-pointed pencil. <quote>She
said she wanted to speak to you rather urgently, but as you weren't in
she would send a written message. About a half-hour later this
came.</quote>
   <p>She handed me a small, pale-blue envelope.
   <p><quote>Thanks, Lesley.</quote> I had started for the elevator when she
asked innocently: <quote>Aren't you going to open it, Mr. Power?</quote>
   <p>I grinned. <quote>Yeah &mdash; where you can't watch my emotional
reactions.</quote>
   <p>I went up to my apartment and read the letter. I didn't know
quite what I had expected &mdash; if I had expected anything in
particular &mdash; but what it said shook me.

   <p>Dear John &mdash; I was very distressed when you left me with those
dreadful words. I simply do not know what I can do to convince you
how wrong you are. But I shall never have the opportunity &mdash; because
tonight I am flying back to Rome.
   <p>I have been uncertain for some time about my engagement to Mr.
Mallory and today I decided not to marry. I have explained this to
him and I think he understands &mdash; better, I am afraid, than you
understand me. So it is goodbye &mdash; Adriana Pavone.

   <p>I dropped the letter on my desk and rammed tobacco into the
biggest pipe I have. The hell with Adriana Pavone!
   <p>If she wanted to skip back to Rome &mdash; let her. I didn't give a
damn.
   <p>
   <p>JUST the same, I found myself picking up the letter and
reading it again.
   <p>So she wasn't marrying Mallory. Maybe she wanted old man Power?
   <p>Maybe she didn't care about either of us? Maybe she didn't care
about New York once she had latched on to that five-million-dollar
pay-off? The thoughts jostled through my mind &mdash; and came to a sudden
stop.
   <p>She could not hope to conclude a deal like that in a couple of
days, could she?
   <p>She was just stalling.
   <p><quote>I'm flying back to Rome, my sweet, so you don't any longer
need to poke your goddam nose into my affairs...</quote>
   <p>That could be it.
   <p>I grabbed the telephone and got through to the air terminal.
   <p><quote>Is there a reservation on the night flight to Rome in the name
of Signorina Adriana Pavone?</quote> I asked. <quote>I have to contact her
before she checks in.</quote>
   <p>A girl clerk answered: <quote>Wait a minute, sir. I'll find out.</quote>
   <p>There was a long pause. I dragged pipe smoke in coughing clouds.
   <p>Then the line came alive again. <quote>Sorry, sir. We have no
reservation in that name.</quote>
   <p><quote>The morning flight tomorrow, then?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've looked, sir. No one of that name is booked to Rome.</quote>
   <p><quote>Thanks,</quote> I said thickly.
   <p>
   <p>FIFTEEN minutes later I was driving north again. The
commissionaire wasn't on hand at the plushy hotel where Adriana was
staying, so I rode myself straight up to the penthouse suite.
   <p>The door was locked. I banged on it three times. That made it
open about a foot and a face came into slit view &mdash; a thin, faintly
yellowed face with eyes like deadly sins and shining crinkly hair.
   <p>He was around twenty-five years old and looked like a Filipino
houseboy. Before, I had not noticed that she had one.
   <p><quote>Miss Adriana Pavone,</quote> I said. <quote>John Power calling.</quote>
   <p>He twisted a wide mouthful of teeth into a grin.
   <p><quote>Miss Pavone not in, sir.</quote>
   <p><quote>You know where she's gone?</quote>
   <p><quote>No sir. But no come back.</quote> The grin had died but the
eyes were alert. Too alert.
   <p><quote>I haven't seen you here before, have I?</quote>
   <p>I put a foot in the door as I said it. He looked down at the
foot and smiled a long slow smile.
   <p><quote>If you are friend of hers, I tell,</quote> he said. <quote>Miss
Pavone left just now with all her baggage. She fly back to Rome,
sir.</quote>
   <p><quote>On the night flight?</quote>
   <p>He started to nod, then checked himself. But he was too late.
   <p><quote>The night flight doesn't take off until eleven-thirty,</quote> I
said.
   <p><quote>She has some shopping to do first, I think.</quote> His eyes were
snapping at me now. A tiny globule of saliva pooled on the left side
of his mouth.
   <p>I swung my shoulder against the door. He reeled back, his arms
flailing.
   <p>I went in.
   <p><quote>You're lying, Flip. Where's she gone &mdash; and why?</quote>
   <p>He backed warily from me, going across the hallway towards the
wide lounge. Then, without warning, he lunged.
   <p>Something long and blue and shining had slid down his sleeve into
his right hand.
   <p>I hit him on the point of the jaw with everything I had. For a
second he seemed to hang, suspended in mid air. Then he zoomed
backwards, hit the floor and rolled over.
   <p>But he was not done.
   <p>He came face-upwards on the roll, his wrist angled for a
knife-throw.
   <p>I trod savagely on his wrist and ground it until he screamed his
agony. The flick-knife jumped out of his hand, clattering over the
floor.
   <p>I reached down, hooked him up by his collar, and hit him one more
time in the mouth. I felt a couple of his teeth crack.
   <p>
   <p>HE sat sprawled on a large sofa, his mouth full of blood
and his eyes full of death. I felt inside his jacket and down the
outside of his pants. He was not wearing artillery.
   <p><quote>All right &mdash; talk,</quote> I barked.
   <p>He dragged a handkerchief from his breast-pocket and dabbed at
his mouth. I took the gun from under my arm, the big Luger I thought
I had not needed in Rome.
   <p><quote>You can go into the bathroom and fix your mouth,</quote> I said.
   <p>He stood up soundlessly and speechlessly and glided across the
hallway and through a door. I went in after him and watched while he
got the dislodged teeth out of his face.
   <p><quote>All right,</quote> I said again, <quote>tell it.</quote>
   <p>He smiled wolfishly, but no words came.
   <p><quote>I could beat it out of you, Flip,</quote> I said, <quote>but I haven't
the time and I haven't sadistic instincts.
   <p><quote>On the other hand, I could drag you down to police headquarters
and the boys could stand you under the lights.</quote>
   <p>He swayed against the wash-basin, killing me with his eyes.
   <p>I shrugged. <quote>I haven't the time for that, either. You stay
tied up in the locked bathroom until I get back &mdash; with a gag in your
mouth. And if it's damned uncomfortable I'm not going to shed
tears.</quote>
   <p>I turned the lock and went into the big lounge. I dropped the
key on to Adriana's writing desk. Something was on it. A piece of
paper, pale blue, like that she had used to write to me.
   <p>It had writing on it, too:

   <p>Dear John &mdash; I was very distressed when you left me with those
dreadful words. I simply do not know what I can do to convince you
how wrong you are, but I would like &mdash;

   <p>There was no more. Just a letter she had begun and then
started again on another sheet.
   <p>Pushed against the back of the desk top was a newspaper, folded
down on black headlines which read:
   <p>FRANK DELGARRA, BACK FROM ROME, TALKS OF BIG DEAL.

<text id=LOBN23>
   <p>Durieux unbuttoned the right breast pocket of his parachute
smock, his fingers fumbling with the stiffness of the new canvas.
   <p><squote>This is my party card,</squote> he said, holding it high, that all
might see it. <squote>I am more proud of this card than of this badge.</squote>
   <p>When he said this, Durieux tapped the silver-nickel badge that
was pinned to the flap of his right breast pocket. The badge
consisted of an opened parachute flanked by wings. Cynics said the
wings had been added to remind the wearer that he might one day have
need of them, for parachute-packing is not an exact science, and
parachute packers have been known to err. The badge meant that
Durieux's parachute had six times successfully responded to his pull
at the ripcord, with himself dangling from the rigging lines,
fluttering to earth like an autumn leaf discarded from the military
tree.
   <p><squote>Is it a real party card?</squote> asked Rossi. <squote>It's not like any
party card that I ever saw. I'll bet it's a forgery.</squote>
   <p><squote>See for yourself,</squote> shouted Durieux, thrusting the card close
to the Corsican's face.
   <p>Rossi spat very deliberately, and very messily, upon Durieux's
party card. The other paras, who had guessed what was to come,
shouted with laughter.
   <p><squote>I'm going to make you lick that card clean,</squote> said Durieux.
   <p>He reached down for the nape of Rossi's neck with his left hand.
His intention was to force the Corsican's nose into the spittle. But
Rossi jerked Durieux's heels from beneath him. Durieux pitched
forward, falling over Rossi. Durieux could have clutched at Rossi to
save himself, but he still held on to the party card and would not let
it go. The restraining hands of two paras, one at either side of
Rossi, were all that saved Durieux from falling into the fire.
   <p>One of the paras who held Durieux spun him roughly about, so that
he stumbled away from the fire. His first concern was for the party
card. It was scorched &mdash; as were the fingers that held it &mdash; and
Rossi's spittle was bubbling on the cardboard. Durieux wiped the card
clean, using great care, with his handkerchief. He placed the card
back in his breast pocket and buttoned it beneath the parachute badge.
Only then did he return to Rossi, who was still lying beside the
fire.
   <p><squote>Now you won't be able to make me lick it off,</squote> said Rossi.
   <p><squote>I'll do better than that,</squote> promised Durieux. <squote>Get up,
Rossi.</squote>
   <p><squote>Enchanted by the invitation, comrade Durieux.</squote>
   <p>Rossi arose with the muscular tension of a caged leopard at
feeding time. Durieux almost regretted having issued the invitation.
Rossi was tall, but he did not tower above Durieux; he was broad, yet
not significantly wider than Durieux; but he was unmistakably the more
aggressive.
   <p>Looking at Rossi, Durieux could not believe that his opponent
possessed the fighting instincts of a mere man: it was as though the
Corsican belonged spiritually to another species. The leopard-skin
pattern upon his parachute smock might have been an outward expression
of his character.
   <p>Yet Durieux was no coward, nor was he easily intimidated. So he
fired his right fist into Rossi's face and caught the Corsican on the
mouth. His knuckles made a wooden sound against Rossi's teeth. Rossi
rode the blow, swaying back from the hips upon which his hands still
rested, but his lips split like an over-ripe tomato. Blood flowed
from them and ran down his chin like wine. Rossi ran his tongue over
the blood: he seemed to savour the taste; he was smiling.
   <p>Then Rossi struck Durieux a terrible blow that landed midway
between crutch and waist. Durieux had never been hit so hard before,
though he had become an amateur boxer in his student days in order to
gain popularity and engender self-confidence. But he had never even
imagined that it was possible to be hit so hard. The blow took all
pleasure out of anger, out of fighting, out of life itself. Durieux's
head went down until it was level with his knees. He folded up so
fast that Rossi's second blow &mdash; a right cross &mdash; landed on his temple.
Instead of breaking Durieux's jaw, as Rossi had intended it should,
the blow split his scalp. He was felled to the ground as a bullock is
felled by a humane killer. His head suddenly became enormous and
empty: the echoes of the blow rang through his brain like the angelus
bell in a church tower. He felt the blood move stickily from his
split scalp and trickle down his forehead. He felt as though all
feelings were at an end.
   <p>Then Durieux realized that he was still capable of having such
primitive feeling as pain. He could still hear, despite the sounding
in his ears, despite the lights behind his eyes, despite the knotted
cramp of his intestines. And Durieux became intensely relieved that
he could still experience these things.
   <p>If he hits me like that again, thought Durieux, he will
undoubtedly kill me. If by chance he does not kill me I shall be
crippled for life. Even if he fails to kill or cripple me I shall be
permanently disfigured. None of these things is going to help
propagate Marxist-Leninist doctrines.
   <p>Therefore, Durieux continued when he could hear himself thinking,
I must somehow save myself. The best thing I can do is lie still and
let him think that he has knocked me out. If everyone believes that
Rossi has knocked me out they will not expect me to get up and fight
him again. The fight is over. Even the best boxers get themselves
knocked out, especially by a lucky blow. There is no dishonour in
that. I struck the first blow. I have shown them all that I am not
afraid of Rossi. I was disabled by a foul blow and knocked out by a
lucky blow. It was almost an accident. I have now earned my place by
the fire. I believe that I really must have been knocked out. I am
only just coming to my senses. That is why I am only now able to
think clearly. I was knocked out, but I bear Rossi no ill-will. The
fight is finished.
   <p><squote>He's shamming,</squote> said Rossi.
   <p><squote>He's shagged,</squote> said someone.
   <p><squote>Balls,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>I was playing with him. I only used
my fists. I want to have some fun out of this fight. It's a long
time since I fought a Viet.</squote>
   <p><squote>He isn't a Viet,</squote> said someone else. <squote>He's only a
commie.</squote>
   <p><squote>Viet or commie,</squote> said Rossi, <squote>I'm going to beat the crap out
of him. I'll teach the depot to send us commies.</squote>
   <p><squote>They probably didn't know he was a commie,</squote> said someone
else. <squote>You know how the bastards infiltrate.</squote>
   <p><squote>They'll know he's a commie when I've finished with him,</squote> said
Rossi.
   <p>Durieux felt a sudden pain in his side; and he was flung over on
his back. The kick had landed sickeningly just below his ribs.
Durieux was relieved that Rossi was wearing rubber-soled jumping
boots and not the steel-tipped infantry issue.
   <p><squote>Don't kick him,</squote> said a voice, Marechal's voice.
   <p><squote>He's a subversive,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>I could kick him to death
and get congratulated for it. I caught him encouraging us to read
left-wing journals, didn't I? Wasn't he about to encourage us lads to
desert?</squote>
   <p><squote>That's a load of bull,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>You needled him
until he produced his party card.</squote>
   <p><squote>I knew he was a commie,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>I can smell the
bastards out as surely as I can smell the bogs.</squote>
   <p><squote>Perhaps he's an ex-commie now,</squote> said someone. <squote>It looks as
though you did him in.</squote>
   <p><squote>He's firing at the flank,</squote> said Rossi.
   <p><squote>He's been shamming for a long time then,</squote> said someone else.
<squote>Not everyone has a head as thick as yours, Rossi.</squote>
   <p><squote>I'll hold a light under his mug and see if he moves,</squote> said
Rossi.
   <p>Durieux could smell the brand from the fire as Rossi approached
him. It was so close that he inhaled the sweet smoke, and felt the
heat glow against his eyelids. He decided that it was time to groan
as a preliminary to feigning a return to consciousness. Rossi kicked
him again, but mildly this time, an exploratory kick. Durieux raised
his head slightly, let it loll back, and opened his eyes. Rossi threw
the blazing brand back into the fire.
   <p>Durieux groaned again. He rolled his eyes and raised himself on
one elbow. The recovery, he decided, must be very gradual; otherwise
Rossi might take it as an invitation to renew the fight. He groaned
and sank back again.
   <p><squote>Commies,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>I could crap a better commie.</squote>
   <p>Marechal stood up and walked over to where Durieux lay. He was
carrying his canteen and he offered it to Durieux.
   <p><squote>Drink this,</squote> said Marechal.
   <p><squote>He doesn't drink,</squote> said Rossi in a mincing voice. <squote>And it's
quite possible that he doesn't poke either.</squote>
   <p><squote>He'll learn to do both,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>And to fight.
He's got a lot to learn.</squote>
   <p>Durieux took the canteen, not because he wanted to drink, but
because to lie there drinking would prolong the period before he must
rise. So he drank slowly. He found that he was drinking neat pastis.
The liquorice taste was unmistakable even though he had not tasted it
before. He spluttered and coughed as the liquid ran down his throat
and surged into his stomach. But he suddenly felt a great deal
better.
   <p>This stuff is liquid fire, thought Durieux. It's like napalm.
What do you know of napalm? he asked himself out of journalistic
habit. Nothing, he admitted, or very little, but I'd like to have
some for Rossi, he told himself. I'd like to see that bastard burn.
   <p><squote>Go easy with that stuff, man, if you aren't used to it,</squote> he
heard Marechal warning him.
   <p><squote>It will do him good,</squote> said Rossi. <squote>It may even put some
guts into the miserable little sod.</squote>
   <p>Accepting this as encouragement, Durieux took another long drink
from the canteen before returning it to Marechal. Then he looked
directly at Rossi. Durieux forced himself to be no longer afraid of
Rossi.
   <p><squote>Shut your dirty trap, Rossi, or I'll shut it for you,</squote> he
announced.
   <p><squote>Want some more?</squote>
   <p><squote>I'll smash your mug in,</squote> said Durieux.
   <p>He lurched to his feet and as suddenly sat down again, for the
ground appeared to rise with him. He got to his knees and became
conscious of pain where Rossi had struck the blow. Durieux fell
forward and was violently sick in the fire: yellow bile that bubbled
and spluttered. Everything tasted and stank of aniseed. But when he
had wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, Durieux felt much
better.
   <p><squote>Now I'll finish him off,</squote> said Rossi.
   <p><squote>Shut up,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>He's beaten up already. Leave
the poor bastard be. What's the matter with you, man? Can't you find
anyone of your own weight to fight?</squote>
   <p><squote>Are you looking for a boy beneath your blanket?</squote> asked Rossi.
   <p><squote>You know me,</squote> said Marechal.
   <p><squote>Why else should anyone want to protect a commie from what's
coming to him?</squote> asked Rossi.
   <p>Durieux had at last succeeded in staying on his feet. The stars
of the African night were duplicated in his head. The pastis had
entered his blood stream.
   <p><squote>I'm going to have your guts for a tie,</squote> he told Rossi.
   <p><squote>He's as pissed as a Pole,</squote> said Marechal.
   <p><squote>I can lick any man in this stick,</squote> announced Rossi.
   <p><squote>Except me,</squote> Marechal reminded him.
   <p><squote>I can lick you in a stand up and smash down fight,</squote> shouted
Rossi. <squote>Who cares about wrestling?</squote>
   <p><squote>I care, man,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>I like to wrestle
sometimes.</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm going to do you both,</squote> announced Durieux, approaching
them at a stagger. <squote>I'm going to do the whole world.</squote>
   <p><squote>You're too ambitious,</squote> said Marechal. <squote>Has anyone got some
black coffee?</squote>
   <p>Someone handed over a mug of black coffee and Marechal gave it to
Durieux. Durieux spilled some of the coffee down the front of his
uniform; it mingled with the stains of his blood, now drying out
brown, and merged well with the dapple-camouflage pattern.

<head>A Night in the Firth</head>
<head>BY JOHN MACGILLIVRAY</head>
   <p>WILLIE MOIR is a big-boned, fresh, sandy-haired young man
of about twenty-five, with bushy brows and a ready smile. He was
washing himself at the sink after a day spent working hard in the
wood, and his evening meal was all ready hot and steaming on the
table.
   <p>His father was sitting there waiting for Willie to join him,
whilst his mother, short and tubby, was hovering between the oven and
the table, like a broody hen; not quite clucking.
   <p>As he dried himself Willie said: <quote>I came round by the harbour
on my way home. Jimmy Fraser was there and I think I'll go with him
the night. Fishing. He's going out later on.</quote>
   <p><quote>Fishing?</quote> his father asked. <quote>I was never fishing in my
life.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why d'ye not come with us then? It'll be a grand night. You
could come.</quote>
   <p><quote>No' me. I don't like boats.</quote>
   <p><quote>Were you ever on one?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, many a one. Troopships, in the war. Men and horses all
together &mdash; and comin' home when it was done. I don't like them at
all.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ach, be quiet. That's different altogether. You couldna'
get a goat on Jimmy's boat, never mind a horse. It'll be fine and
quiet, oot on the firth.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, maybe quiet. It's quiet enough here for me. I'm no'
going. Come and get your tea before it's cold.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's right. Sit in, Willie. You'll be hungry I'm sure, out
all day. Sit in,</quote> said his mother.
   <p><quote>I don't ken one fish from the other,</quote> said the father.
<quote>Except maybe a salmon and a spelding. They're a' the same to me.
I like fish. Or a herring.</quote>
   <p><quote>A spelding's a haddie,</quote> said Willie. <quote>It's smoked.</quote>
   <p><quote>Maybe it is. What time are you going wi' Jimmy?</quote>
   <p><quote>Aboot ten o'clock. It's the tide.</quote>
   <p><quote>H'm. An' what time will you be home?</quote>
   <p><quote>In the morning. About nine o'clock maybe.</quote>
   <p><quote>And what aboot your work?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ach, it's Saturday. Surely I can take a Saturday morning once
in the year. It's no' much; only a half holiday.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a half day just the same. It wouldna do if we were all
taking half days.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ach, be quate. In the Sooth they don't work on any
Saturdays at all, and they do all right.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, the kind o' them! I'd shoot the half o' them. What kind
o' an engine has he in the boatie?</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a Diesel,</quote> said Willie. <quote>Very good, he says, when it
goes. Hasna quite got the hang o' it yet.</quote>
   <p><quote>Watch yoursel' then. Don't be goin' to America or something.
You'll maybe be sick, will you? Can you swim?</quote>
   <p><quote>All Commandos can swim,</quote> said Willie. <quote>But I'm no' swimming
the night. Too cold. I'll take a flask o' tea wi' me, Mam, and a few
sandwiches.</quote>
   <p><quote>All right, boy, all right. I'll make them ready for you at
nine o'clock. Will that do?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, fine. I'll be in for them then.</quote>
   <p>Big Charlie, the father, took a turn outside in the calm, long
summer evening. The hills to the south, and Ben Wyvis to the west,
stood clear and near.
   <p>He could occasionally hear the sea washing on the beach, and he
remembered those other hot sandy beaches and the warm middle sea, so
many years ago.
   <p>Willie collected his food parcel and made for the harbour, going
in through the fishertown. Here and there people were gossiping at
gable corners in twos or threes, mostly short round folk, men and
women, the men with layers of jerseys and clean flat caps.
   <p>Jimmy Fraser was a fisherman. Fresh, wrinkly-faced,
clean-shaven, and good natured, he was working on the deck of his boat
Magda, and called to Willie, <quote>That you, Wull? Stop there till I
start the Diesel, then bring in the lines and we'll away.</quote> He
disappeared down a small hatch and Willie could hear him at the
engine.
   <p>Jimmy came up and into the little wheelhouse, waving Willie to
come aboard with the mooring lines; then he gently edged the nose of
his craft across the still harbour towards the entrance and the firth.
   <p><quote>Just the two o' us, Jimmy?</quote> asked Willie.
   <p><quote>Ay, ay, Wull. It's no' much the night, just a few lines, I
thought we'd manage fine. Mind your feet when we get outside, she'll
maybe lift.</quote>
   <p>As the evening spent the light grew less and the firth turned
dark grey. The breeze blowing across the tide made a little lop on
the surface, so when Magda left the shelter of the harbour her bow
lifted to the lop and she heeled to the push of the breeze. Jimmy
increased his speed and the exhaust beat hardened, though still not
fast.
   <p>They turned to the north-east, heading for the darkening, and the
bows set to a rolling lift and fall, slight and regular. <quote>She'll do
six or seven knots, dependin',</quote> said Jimmy. <quote>She's no' just right
this last few days. But there's no great hurry.</quote>
   <p><quote>Can I no' steer her?</quote> asked Willie. <quote>I think I'll manage
her. What way are we going?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ay, take her, Wull. Here and I'll show you. I'll go and
make a droppie tea. Gie me a call if you see anything.</quote>
   <p>He went below and Willie had the night and the boat to himself.
As Magda chugged through the dark he constantly glanced at the
little tell-tale compass. Sky had merged with black sea all ahead,
but away to the north-west, on his left hand, it wasn't yet so black
dark, and an occasional light blinked or flashed over there. <quote>Tarbat
Ness,</quote> he thought. <quote>Or maybe the Sutors.</quote> He was startled when
Jimmy's voice at his shoulder said, <quote>Here y'are, Wull. Tea. I'll
take her while you drink it. There's a light in the cabin if you want
to sit below.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll have it up here, Jim.</quote>
   <p>Willie enjoyed the hot sweet tea, standing on the deck in the
cool of the night, leaning against the wheelhouse and taking his ease.
   <p><quote>It's near twelve o'clock, Jimmy</quote> he said. <quote>When will we get
to your lines?</quote>
   <p><quote>Aboot two, boy; near the slack o' the tide. We'll get the
first o' the light. Are you for the wheel again?</quote>
   <p><quote>Aye, Jim, I'll take her. You get your tea.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>Willie leant slightly forward over the wheel as he conned the
boat, peering into the dark. With a lurch he fell forward over the
spokes, and one of them drove blunt into the pit of his stomach,
stealing his wind, at the same time as he heard Magda's bow strike
with a thump. She paused, and the Diesel missed a beat; before it
regained its regular chug Jimmy was on deck, running to the bow,
stumbling in the dark.
   <p><quote>What is it, Wull?</quote> he shouted. <quote>What ha' we struck?</quote>
   <p>Willie gasped deep, trying to recover his breath. <quote>Don' know,
Jim. Never saw a thing. What is it?</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a dam' tree. Gie's a han' to shift it, man. Wait you
till I put the Diesel oot o' gear.</quote> The engine idled easily,
relieved of its load, and together they went forward where Jimmy's
torch revealed the tree with some branches reaching into the dark,
still across the bow, held there by way of the boat, which hadn't
quite stopped.
   <p><quote>It's doon from the hills wi' the storms and the floods,</quote>
said Jimmy. <quote>I'll back her away from it. Push wi' this boathook,
Wull. Take care an' no' lose it.</quote>
   <p>Willie pushed as best he could, and when the engine ground the
boat astern they came free of the tree and Jimmy released the engine
again.
   <p><quote>What a dunt,</quote> he said. <quote>I wonder has it sprung the
stem.</quote> He went below into the hold, shining his torch.
   <p><quote>Looks a'right, Wull,</quote> he said when he came back. <quote>Just a
bit o' a weep. She'll be a'right if we don't force her.</quote>
   <p>Before the first gleam had showed in the north-east sky Jimmy had
taken the wheel and set Magda more to the south, easing her along
as the dawn came to them. His eyes were screwed nearly closed as he
searched ahead, to right and to left over the face of the sea, and
always he sniffed. Then <quote>Ay,</quote> he said. <quote>They're there, boy.
That's my buoy. Bring over that bait, Wull, in the two baskets at
the bow.</quote> He had cut the engine to idling speed; the boat was
losing way, coming up to the fishing buoy dead slow.
   <p>Jim had explained the job to Willie. They were to lift each line
and rebait it, taking aboard any catch that might be on the hooks. It
was to be a busy job because Magda had to be watched and guided as
well, and Jim knew how best to do this. <quote>See and mind your fingers
wi' the hooks, Wull,</quote> he said.
   <p>Most of the lines had bare hooks as they were hauled aboard,
where the bait had been taken and the fish had escaped, but there were
fishes on some and these flopped and slithered about, trying to get
back to sea. They had nearly filled their second box of fish when Jim
called a halt.
   <p><quote>It's near hand six o'clock, boy. We'll have some more tea,
will we? Then we can work on and away home. There's wind coming from
the south-west. We'll need to work fast.</quote>
   <p>He was edging Magda across to his further lines whilst they
ate their bite in the fresh cold morning air.
   <p><quote>She's no' just right, man,</quote> he said. <quote>Kin' o' grinding a'
the time.</quote> And then, ~<quote>Oh, damn, what's that now?</quote> as the engine
laboured to a standstill.
   <p><quote>Something wrong this time, Jimmy. Let's have a look.</quote> Jimmy
put the engine out of gear and turned it over with the starting
handle. <quote>The engine's free enough; wonder is it the shaft? Maybe
we've caught up my headrope.</quote>
   <p><quote>How can we see, Jim?</quote>
   <p><quote>From the small boat, Wull. We'll put her over. Make fast that
line, so we'll no' lose her.</quote>
   <p>Together they lifted the small boat overside, near Magda's
stern, and Jimmy crouched down in it, searching through the water,
trying to see the propellor.
   <p><quote>I canna see it, Wull,</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>It's all grey. I canna see clear at all. If I could swim
I'd doon and have a look at it.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm no' wanting to wait here, Jim. I'll go in and have a look
at it. It's damn cold, though.</quote>
   <p><quote>Will you manage, boy?</quote>
   <p><quote>Fine that. What do I have to do?</quote>
   <p><quote>Just see is there a rope or something holding the propellor,
and take it off. Cut it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Better get me a sharp knife, then. Tie a string to it.</quote>
   <p>Willie stripped naked and stepped back into the small boat,
shivering. Jim followed with his opened gully, a long string tied to
its handle.
   <p><quote>Have a look first, Wull. You'll need to work fast. The
water's cold.</quote>
   <p><quote>I ken fine it's cold. I can feel it. Here goes,</quote> and
Willie eased himself overside into the sea. <quote>Hoo,</quote> he wheezed,
then, holding his nose, he bent over and kicked his way downhill. In
half a minute he surfaced.
   <p><quote>Losh, it's cold. Gie's the knife. There's rope tight wound
between the propellor and the boat. I'll need to cut it.</quote> He dived
again and stayed under for about a minute, bobbing up blowing and
wheezing.
   <p><quote>It's tight and tough,</quote> he said, teeth chattering, and went
back to it. Several times he dived. Jimmy began to worry because
Willy was obviously wearying in the cold north water.
   <p><quote>This time, Jim. Finish this time.</quote> When next he surfaced he
held up an arm, holding to the small boat with the other. <quote>Gie's
han',</quote> he panted.
   <p>Jimmy hauled on the arm, then on a leg, and Willie rolled
exhausted into the bottom of the boat. <quote>I'm done,</quote> he gasped,
breathing deep and shivering violently.
   <p><quote>Oot o' here, Wull, man. Back aboard and get dry. You'll get
your death,</quote> ordered Jim.

<head>Vendetta!</head>
<head>by Brian Cleeve</head>
   <p>THEY faced each other in the lamplit room, her hands pale
against the black of her dress, clasped together, as if she was afraid
of what he would say to her, or of what she would answer.
   <p><quote>Tell me what really happened,</quote> he whispered. <quote>How did your
father die?</quote> He saw the hands twist, the fingers clench with the
effort of holding the words in. <quote>Was he killed?</quote> he said.
   <p>She lifted one hand, pressed its knuckles against her mouth.
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> she breathed. <quote>They killed him...</quote> She turned
away, towards the deep, narrow window that looked out on the valley,
and Mount Tamborene. There was no moon yet, and the stars were heavy
as gold coins in the South Italian sky.
   <p><quote>And your brother? Silvio?</quote>
   <p><quote>What do you think?</quote> she said, trying to keep the bitterness
from her voice. <quote>He is carrying on the vendetta. Like a hero of the
old times.</quote> She leant her forehead against the cool plaster of the
wall, beside the window. <quote>He is up there, on the mountain. Stealing
their sheep. Burning their shepherds' huts. While we stay here...</quote>
   <p>She was crying now, with a quiet despair that was worse than if
she had screamed aloud. He was afraid to touch her: afraid of many
things, perhaps most of all to wake the thing that he had tried to
forget after all the years in the North, since he left this house.
   <p>Seven years. Seven years ago, stealing out of the house on a
night as dark as this. Running away, a boy's dream in his mind that
one day he would come back with a fortune, to dazzle this family that
had taken him in as an orphan, saved his life &mdash; and exacted the
fullest price for it that they could.
   <p>He had been seven years old when they found him, a piece of
wartime flotsam cast up in a Calabrian valley from God knew where.
Starving, remembering nothing but his name, Ettore, and a
mind-picture of buildings lit by a fantastic glare, tumbling, falling,
while a woman screamed.
   <p>And the Feltri, the richest family in the valley, had let him
sleep in a corner of their yard, and fed him scraps in return for
work; drawing water, minding the goats and chickens, seeing that this
girl beside him didn't stray out of the courtyard. She had been five
then, small and dark and supple as a kitten; running away from him,
laughing at him, hiding, while he ran after her in despair, calling
~<quote>Ginevra, Ginevra,</quote> terrified that he would be beaten or left
without food for not minding her properly.
   <p>There had been Silvio too, almost his own age, but already a
young prince, slender and arrogant. It had been Silvio who gave him
his new name, Orfano. Ettore the Orphan. He had grown up to carry
the name with a kind of sullen pride.
   <p>But for that name he might truly have become one of the family.
They were kind enough to him, as far as they understood what kindness
was. After the first year or so, they didn't beat him any more. They
gave him his place in life against the world, as they gave it to their
dogs, their shepherds, the women who worked in the house, the peasants
who worked on their olive terraces. He belonged to them, to their
faction, opposing the other faction in the village, that of the
Crespi, bitter enemies of the Feltri for more than a hundred years.
   <p>He might have grown up to be like Silvio's true brother, or
cousin, but for that name, Orfano. The children in the village
shrieked it after him, <quote>the orphan, the orphan!</quote> Sometimes at
night he prayed, <quote>When I wake up tomorrow, let me remember my real
name.</quote> But he never did. Only the buildings falling, burning, the
woman screaming.
   <p>The only person that he was really close to was Ginevra;
protecting her from her brother; bringing her new-born chicks in his
cap for an Easter gift. He pretended to himself that both she and he
were orphans; that they were the brother and sister, not she and
Silvio. He gave her all the love that he would have given his whole
family, if he had had one...
   <p>Until quite suddenly, between one day and the next, he realised
that it had become a different kind of love. For a week he had held
the knowledge inside himself, half ecstasy, half terror, like a
pleasure so unbearable that it becomes agony. Then, one evening, when
both of them were drawing water by the well, he had told her what he
felt; had taken her hands, held them against his heart, drawn her
close to him, so close that he could feel the warmth of her breath
against his mouth...
   <p><quote>Ettore?</quote> she had breathed, afraid of what she saw in his
face, what she felt stirring in herself. <quote>Ettore...</quote> And he had
kissed her; not wanting to, holding himself back as if it was a
sacrilege, and yet drawn down to her. And then they had really
kissed, and it was like drunkenness, like falling, like fire in the
mouth, and they both leaned against the well, sick and dizzy, hardly
able to see one another.
   <p>But her father had seen. He came out from the house, shouting
curses. He knocked Ettore to the ground and beat him with a harness
strap until he was barely conscious.
   <p>That night Ettore ran away. He had known that there was no
chance of his being allowed even to speak to Ginevra again. He ran
away, to make his fortune. In a year he would be back, with a motor
car and a sack of gold, and he would pour the gold on the great
kitchen table in front of all of them. When he told them that he had
come back to marry Ginevra, they would go down on their knees to him
in gratitude.
   <p>But that dream had faded very soon, as he begged his way north,
picking up what work he could in Rome, in Bologna, in Milan, Turin.
Until eventually in Turin the police picked him up as a vagabond,
found that he was due for his military service, and shipped him off to
the barracks instead of the gaol.
   <p>He thrived as a soldier. He was drafted into the engineers,
showed promise and intelligence, and was trained as a road surveyor.
When he finished his service, one of his officers found him a job
with a road construction company, and for two years he was working in
the Alps. Calabria, the Feltri &mdash; even Ginevra &mdash; seemed to belong to
another world.
   <p>He felt that it was better like that. It would do him no good to
carry useless regret through life. He tried never to think of her...
   <p>And then the construction company was granted a contract in
Calabria. Ettore Orfano was assigned to it because he knew the
dialect, and would get on with the local workmen. And suddenly he
found himself within twenty miles of Tamborene, and the house which
for ten years of his life had been his home.
   <p>
   <p>FOR a month he debated in his mind whether to go back, then
whether to write first, or simply to arrive. Finally he compromised.
A week's leave was due to him, and he simply wrote that he was
coming, and followed his letter so closely that there would be no time
for a reply.
   <p>He spent the hour-long journey in the bus trying over a dozen
different speeches for his arrival, wondering how they would receive
him, nursing the little pile of gifts in his lap: a pipe for Giovanni
Feltri; silk scarves for the women; a box of cheroots for Silvio. He
was half-eager to walk into the great kitchen with its smoke-blackened
timbers, its huge table, its massive chairs and cavernous hearth; to
show himself to them in his suit from Milan, his town shoes; to show
them what he had become; a man on the rungs of a skilled professional
career, educated, self-assured. And yet also half-afraid. Of what?
Nothing. He could imagine the clamour of welcome. Even old Giovanni
would welcome him, the cuffs, the beatings, the brutalities and the
last quarrel forgotten.
   <p>Ginevra would surely be married now. Perhaps she would have
children. Would she have called one of them Ettore? Whom would she
have married? One of the Crespi? Not very likely. And yet who else
had there been for her to marry? Perhaps she had healed the
century-old vendetta between the families. He tried to be pleased at
the idea.
   <p>The bus hammered to a stop. He was the only passenger to get
down. A few men were sitting in the caf&eacute; opposite, but it was
already half-dark and no one recognized him. He walked very quickly
up the street, into the familiar lane, to the wide, double doors set
in the fortress-thickness of the courtyard wall. He found that his
heart was beating fast, and his mouth was dry.
   <p>Then he heard old footsteps shuffling across the courtyard, an
old voice grumbling, the leaf of the great door swinging open with a
whine of hinges. He recognized one of the servants who had been there
in his time: Franca, who had been old then, and seemed no older now,
as thin as a stick in her widow's black that she had worn for forty
years.
   <p>She stared at him.
   <p><quote>Franca,</quote> he said. <quote>It's me. Ettore Orfano. Don't you
remember?</quote>
   <p><quote>Madonna mia,</quote> she whispered. <quote>Ettore...</quote> Suddenly
she ran back towards the house as if possessed, shrieking at the top
of her voice, <quote>Ettore Orfano, little Ettore; he has come back!
Ginevra, Signora Angela... Maria!</quote>
   <p>He followed her, laughing, and at the same time scarcely able to
breathe for the thudding of his heart, the tightness in his throat.
And then she was in the doorway, looking at him, grown very tall and
slender, her face ivory pale, her dark eyebrows frowning a little,
looking at him among the shadows of the courtyard. Until suddenly her
hand went out to him, her eyes lighting, her remembered voice saying,
<quote>Ettore! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome home!</quote>
   <p>He took her hands, and looked at her from head to foot, while his
fingers felt to see what rings she wore. No wedding ring. And he was
absurdly glad, and then angry with himself.
   <p>He noticed that she was wearing black.
   <p><quote>You are in mourning?</quote> he said. She was already drawing him
into the kitchen.
   <p><quote>For my father</quote>, Ginevra said. <quote>He died a month ago. A fall
on the mountain.</quote>
   <p><quote>May God rest his soul,</quote> Ettore said. <quote>I am very sorry. I
would not have come &mdash; </quote>
   <p>From inside the kitchen, Ginevra's mother caught the last words,
grasped his arms and shook her head at him in rebuke.
   <p><quote>Would not have come?</quote> she exclaimed. <quote>You have kept us
waiting too long as it is. How long will you stay? Where have you...
oh, how fine you have grown, how tall! Eh, Ginevra &mdash; eh, Maria?</quote>
   <p>She seemed not to remember how he had left; only to be glad to
see him again. She had changed, Ettore saw. In the old days she had
been harsh and stiff; afraid of her husband and yet arrogantly proud
that she had a husband strong and fierce enough to make her afraid.
Now all that seemed gone. She seemed to have shrunk, and to have
lost all the certainties that once held her upright.
   <p><quote>And Silvio?</quote> Ettore asked, looking round for him.
   <p>A silence fell on the kitchen. Ginevra looked down, avoiding his
eyes. <quote>He is... he is away,</quote> she said, and immediately began a
great bustle of laying a place for Ettore, of giving orders to Maria
the cook, of fetching wine.
   <p>No one mentioned Silvio again all through the meal. And when
Ettore asked exactly how old Giovanni had died, the same silence fell,
as if there were things about the death that they were unwilling to
discuss, or that made them afraid.

<head>He Got What She Wanted</head>
<head>by NIGEL MORLAND</head>
   <p>He was haunted by an Income-Tax man &mdash; and She by Desire.
   <p>THE years have passed at times like beads told by ancient
fumbling fingers; in other moods I have seen those years race, tearing
out of my uncertain grasp, leaving me with a sense of time laughing at
me.
   <p>But Time in its flight has no pity, nor have the skies mercy. I
have tried to flee my twin devils only to see them running at my side,
pacing me with nonchalant disinterest, neither mocking nor savage,
just there. They stay, impalpable, inflexible, constant, yet beyond
reach as a man's shadow.
   <p>And when did it actually start? The first frail tendons of
misery wrapped round me unseen tentacles as tenuous as the first
shoots of a malignant tumour which remains unknown... and triumphant
on the day the surgeon's knife finds it and is defeated by it. It
grew round me like that, sheltering in my sense of shame, overwhelming
me until I could do nothing, bringing with it a resurgent second
devil, one I thought I had lost. A monstrous towering pair, the
hunger and the thirst, the unfilled, the unslaked...
   <p>But autobiography is apt to run amok with a writer's sense of
drama, for I am, indeed, a writer by trade: were I on my death-bed, as
well I might be, my pen would record the moments as the
self-experimental researcher notes his symptoms. Writing is surely
nothing but the tape recorder of its creator. He might hide, with
thin furtiveness, behind the hedge of fiction, yet, nevertheless, all
writing is merely the writer playing to the audience of himself,
abject before the rowdy despot of the subconscious mind.
   <p>I write because I must, write as Dr. Jekyll might have written
when Mr. Hyde was absent. But I have no doubts of my closeness to
my Mr. Hyde. I am both a human being and the devil's cherished,
indissolvably one in an unending oneness.
   <p>When I look round and see my friends, such as they are, and when
I think on  them I am lost in a sense of wonder. They see me
as I see myself now in the mirror on the far side of this table at
which I am writing.
   <p>Ordinary? Indeed so. A slightly built man of medium height;
slim, rather feminine hands, small feet and good bones. My face is
simply that, the epitome of John Doe: quiet blue eyes, dark hair and
what the nice-minded call pleasing features. A man, a passable,
civilised, modest man of perhaps forty. Obviously cleanly; obviously
of good parentage and of good education. Those who attend to my wants
call me <squote>sir</squote> and I treat them fairly; head waiters are polite to
me.
   <p>My friends see all that in me, too. <quote>Frank Damon?</quote> so they
would answer an enquiry, <quote>old Frank? Lord, yes, a nice chap. Quiet,
you know. Good company over a drink and a useful man at bridge and
tennis. Writes, you know</quote> &mdash; here that inevitable apologetic English
chuckle &mdash; <quote>and good at political stuff. Thrillers as well.</quote> Here
the amused smiles. <quote>Never read the things myself, of course! But
they must be good. He makes money.</quote>
   <p>Old Frank, and I look in the mirror at old Frank, one invisible
devil on each shoulder.
   <p>I always did like political science, but thrillers pay, not that
I really need it. I use a pseudonym, John Laker Considine (carefully
chosen, that &mdash; Carr, Chandler, Charteris, Cheyney, Christie; and
Considine fits neatly in the middle on the shelves, picking up some
reflected glory). You know my characters? Dr. Malobo? The Red
Aces of Justice? Rafferty of Scotland Yard? Colourful stuff, wild,
and perhaps melodramatic, but impervious to my devils.
   <p>John Laker Considine and his bright jackets. Poor old shadow!
Piling up wilderness of escapism for those who would flee themselves.
And behind this veritable escapist stands his alter ego, the
substantial presence of Frank Damon, old Frank, the nice chap who
would give everything in his world, unto the clothes he wears, to
become John Laker Considine who dwells in his one-dimensioned
pseudonymous world.
   <p>Out of the windows of my gracious study I can look across my
small garden, backing on this house my family left me, and becoming
Hyde Park. On the other side, the front of the house, is the rear of
Knightsbridge. A noble and valuable house, big for a solitary man,
and one that I love.
   <p>However, I digress. With my ballpoint in my hand and my thoughts
arrayed, my greater morbidities shrink back though they do not leave
me entirely, even with the spring brightness of Hyde Park to delight
my eyes.
   <p>Brightness in Nature in no way detracts from my devils. The one,
the older one, I endured and continue to endure though its
continuation shocked me; the second devil came on me a year after
Dunkirk, over a decade ago; it was the more awful of the pair.
Fortunately it was in London in the chaos of war with bombs turning
civic life to ruin. I was able to disappear, for money I had and I
was able to buy oblivion and secrecy.
   <p>That second devil came on me so stealthily that I did not believe
it at first; then I shrank back affrighted, crushed, nauseated. I had
to bear it alone &mdash; and it is only now, thinking on it all, that I
understand how the leper must feel.
   <p>My mother and father died before the Second World War broke out;
they left me this house in which I have returned to live again, and
they left me money. Writing I took up as a release from myself, and
as a means to power without visibility &mdash; a purely morbid passion!
   <p>Yet I always require anonymity. That is easily found in London.
The world and the people I knew before Dunkirk went with those same
tides of war which washed smooth the sands of my acquaintance,
enabling me to start again.
   <p>So, too, went Mary Damon. The world had no need to recall her at
all, for those same tides had washed her away as well. But this
little man must come enquiring. A troublesome little man, seemingly
as harmless as a fly on the wall: brownish &mdash; hair, skin, eyes &mdash; and
slight. Not young, and sadly dressed, with fraying cuff edges and a
dusty old hat, a man you could see with a cake and a glass of milk in
a cheap restaurant, a man no one would ever notice, wholly a human
zero except, perhaps, in his name &mdash; Arthur George Zink.
   <p>He was here last week, enquiring so mildly, blinking at me from
behind his thick spectacles, affable, self-effacing, desiring not to
trouble me, enquiring for Mary Damon, apologising for bothering me,
gentle, kindly Arthur George Zink &mdash; as weakly persistent as a dripping
tap, so damnably, politely, endlessly persistent!
   <p>I see the tremendous juggernauts of bureaucracy hauled by
regiments of Arthur George Zinks, little men and even little women at
their eternal writing, making their entries, adding their sums,
putting one and one together, until a total must emerge. And asking
questions, unavoidable questions, persistently, persistently...
   <p>
   <p>The inspector's glare was ferocious.
   <p><quote>You think that, sir?</quote> He put both hands on the desk, leaning
forward to tower over the plump amiability of Superintendent Leeds.
<quote>It's the fifth one &mdash; don't forget it.</quote>
   <p>Leeds beamed at Detective-Inspector Chater. Because they had
become friends when they met as uniformed probationers on their two
basic years, they usually forgot rank when alone.
   <p><quote>You're letting the thing infuriate you, Tom &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Chater threw up his arms and sat down, placated by the use of his
Christian name.
   <p><quote>Naturally I'm a trifle distrait.</quote> He glared. <quote>Five
kidnappings and five kids returned without a hair of their dear little
heads being harmed, without a single mother screaming blue murder
after the first knowledge of the thing &mdash;</quote> Chater jerked a thumb to
indicate all New Scotland Yard. <quote>The pundits must be delighted.</quote>
   <p><quote>They are indeed.</quote> Leeds flapped his hands at the lean black
Highland fury of his friend. <quote>But I'm your super, old boy. Won't
the mothers say a thing? You can tell me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Tush! Compounding, dammit! And do they care?</quote> Chater
sniffed. <quote>Ach! And how can I move? I can't even prove they've paid
or how much or where. Women!</quote>
   <p><quote>Kids all right, I s'pose?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've got my methods in finding out. Aye, they're bonny.
Clean, well-fed, cared for, happy as Larry. I've known a few
kidnappings but none like this.</quote>
   <p><quote>And why won't the mothers talk? What's behind it? Can't you
get one of the Yanks to come across and help us? They're used to the
snatch racket.</quote>
   <p>Leeds grimaced.
   <p><quote>Now, Tom. We're in a cleft stick, you know it. Nobody's
complained, at least the complaints've been withdrawn as soon as made.
We can't prove anything, or even how the money passed &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>There's such a thing as compounding &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Be quiet, Tom. It'd be a hellish charge to get across in
court. Can you see the Attorney-General's face if he was asked to
support a charge against a mother for compounding when her child has
been kidnapped and she wanted it back?</quote> Leeds leaned forward.
<quote>Tom, get the bastard, will you? Apart from everything else, it's a
dirty business.</quote>
   <p>Chater snorted irately.
   <p>
   <p>But this is not work. I have the newest adventure of Dr.
Malobar to finish, a matter of ten thousand words, yet I find essays
at autobiography so fascinating, the ancient principle of confession
being good for the soul!
   <p>It may be. It is also a minor antidote to devils. I am feeling
clearer in mind, more comfortable. There is the Malobar manuscript to
fetch. I am old-fashioned in that I write in longhand, for my mind
constructs and perfects the next sentence while I am still writing.
The folder of manuscript lives in the built-in cupboard in the
bedroom, for no sensible reason.
   <p>When I opened the door and bent to pick up the folder, a wave of
nostalgia swept over me. Not for months had it happened. Perhaps the
spring air intensified the deep scent of gardenia, that
well-remembered scent.
   <p>All carefully preserved, hanging there, the outer world of Mary
Damon... there was the coral taffeta with the full skirt, the brown
check suit &mdash; a costly article &mdash; bought in Bond Street, and the ivory
satin cloak that had gone to all the best theatres in London. There
was the fur coat &mdash; Persian lamb, a most expensive thing, costly, too,
but I saw it as hateful, for only the other day I read of what happens
to those small lambs... I touched garment after garment, each
fashioned article had a memory a decade old, a story, an appeal, and
each reached out to me, disturbing me, hurting &mdash; me, a man, a writer
of bloodthirsty tales, John Laker Considine, no less!
   <p>But the requested Danegeld was paid in the coinage of uneasy
recollection which memory demanded. I was a fool, a thrice damned
fool to keep these things here, a stupid danger in their way, yet I
could do nothing, could not get rid of them any more than could a
mother throw away the relics of a dead child.
<head>Five children kidnapped &mdash; and no clue to the guilty</head>
   <p>Then it began worrying me again, that probing little man, that
subtle and insinuating Zink. A wholly absurd name which comes
dangerously close to Mary... God forbid that he can disinter her, yet
in a most shocking sense he can do that if he comes too close, and
then?
   <p>These morbid thoughts did not help me. I thrust the pen at the
paper, back again at my table, and thought of Dr. Malobar, <squote>The
tall man with the dramatic green eyes seemed to tower over the whole
room, a growing domination of terror.</squote> There it stopped, a hiatus
which remained.
   <p>It was no use trying; I could not write. That brownish little
man of the frayed cuffs and the dusty hat would not leave my mind.

<head>LARSEN'S LAST HAUL</head>
   <p><quote>Lucky</quote> Larsen, the ruthless skipper of the Arctic trawler
<quote>Volsung</quote>, did not believe in Hell hereafter. He only believed in
the immediate hell of his savage way of life... by George
Goldsmith-Carter
   <p>THE ARCTIC TRAWLER Volsung laboured heavily at her trawl
in the looping ground-swell to the west nor' west of Andenes
lighthouse, flashing feebly against the sleet-blurred, rocky backdrop
of the coast of North West Norway.
   <p>Above the tiny vessel the Northern Lights rippled in green,
barbaric radiance across a sable, freezing sky. Beneath her restless
keel rolled water which, glacial blue in the few hours of half light
yet to come, was now black and bitter as death.
   <p>The massive bulk of <quote>LUCKY</quote> LARSEN, skipper of the
Volsung, loomed in the open window of the wheelhouse, from whence
he stood watching, heedless of the gathering rime of frost which
glittered on the red stubble of his heavy jaw. He looked across the
dark sea to where the tip of the new moon was thrusting like a silver
dagger from behind the shark-toothed peaks of Andoy, then his wolfish
eyes shifted to the fish-pounds in the fore-deck beneath him.
Illuminated by the glare of the deck lights a dozen men were toiling,
their oilskinned backs hunched against the bite of the searing wind
which glazed the ship with ice. Those men had been on their feet for
seventy hours now, labouring without a break, and, half blind and
savage with exhaustion, they were reduced almost to the level of
beasts. Men driven beyond endurance by the silent menace of the
watcher above to shoot and haul the giant net, to gut and pack the
torrent of bronze-backed haddock which shimmered endlessly inboard,
and curse the cooks if the mugs of strong and scalding tea were not
forthcoming.
   <p>Larsen's <quote>Luck</quote> lay in his inherited ability to find the
roving fish shoals when others could not and having found them, harry
his crew without mercy until the fish holds were full. Yet in spite
of his reputation men still joined his ship to share the wealth he
found, knowing that in the finding he would break their bodies and
their spirits, driving them with flaying tongue and fist until the
voyage was made. Then when at last the hatches were battened down,
they would reel below to drop exhausted in their reeking clothes,
lying like corpses where they fell.
   <p>The crew of the Volsung had almost reached that point now,
for their bloodshot eyes were glazed with exhaustion and the blank
look of sleep walkers was on their scale and slime masked faces as
they toiled unceasingly amid the slaughter of the fish-pounds.
   <p>There was comprehension but no pity on Larsen's face as he
bleakly watched his crew, for he knew that there was no room for pity
in this way of life. A few hours back a young deck-hand on his first
trip had stumbled up to him, his frost-ravaged, bleeding hands held
out in supplication. <quote>For the love of God, skipper, I just can't
carry on!</quote> he had cried. With bitter and contemptuous words Larsen
had ordered him below to help the cook, telling him that thereafter he
would receive no pay.
   <p>Larsen's restless gaze swept to the fish-gutters, their inflamed
and toil-swollen wrists swathed in old rags to ease the abrasion of
the sand spilling from the bellies of the fish which they were ripping
open. The gutting knives flashed ceaselessly, in at the vent, out at
the gills. Like automatons the men worked, flinging the livers into
baskets for rendering into fish-oil, tossing the entrails overboard in
an endless stream.
   <p>Larsen's frost-blackened lips curved cynically as he watched the
screaming horde of sea-fowl swooping avidly at the offal which
encircled his ship. All about him gleamed the fishing lights of many
nationalities. He knew that each trawler, like his own, was emptying
the sea of fish, destroying unborn life and fouling the sea with an
endless torrent of filth. With savage irony men had called this
mighty gathering of fishing craft <quote>The League of Nations</quote>, for the
trawlers fished in bitter rivalry, the larger vessels ruthlessly
thrusting the smaller ones from where the haddock shoaled the
thickest. One thing alone Larsen knew these raiders had in common &mdash; a
blind rapacity which chose to disregard the barren future of the seas.
Yet this heedless rapine meant nothing to him, for in his
grandfather's day men had thus plundered the North Sea. <quote>The
Gamecocks</quote>, <quote>The Short Blues</quote> and other great fleets of rival
sailing trawlers had swept bare the Dogger Bank, denuded the fabulous
<quote>Silver Pits</quote>, looted the fishy gold of the California Grounds.
Then with the North Sea almost barren they had turned to the west,
scouring away the Lemon soles of Cornwall's Klondyke Ground.
   <p>In his own time the Spanish trawlers had pillaged, almost
overnight, the silver hake of southern Irish waters, ruining Milford
Haven, once the chief hake port of the world. Then with home waters a
desolation, a new type of trawler had appeared. The powerful <quote>High
Altitude</quote> trawlers which now ravaged the bitter waters of Bear
Island and Nova Zembla; the plaice abounding shallows of the White
Sea; the cod-rich Icelandic Banks &mdash; and these haddock-teeming
Norwegian Deeps.
   <p><quote>The Wall of Death</quote> some called the place, a grim spot where
the Continental Shelf swooped steeply from the surf smashed rocks of
the shore, ending in a submerged precipice which plunged twelve
thousand feet into the Oceanic depths beneath. Against this
deep-drowned cliff the gale-driven surges of the Arctic Ocean beat in
elemental malice, creating a maelstrom which was death to ships and
men.
   <p>Yet Larsen knew no pity for the dead whose bones lay far beneath
him, he knew only the law of the Northern Trawl, <quote>The weak perish
but the strong survive.</quote> Nor did he heed the fools who believed
these water  haunted by ghost ships with the earth-bound
spirits of their crews doomed forever to endure the torment of their
earthly memories and re-enact in endless ghostly parody the last
moments of their lives. He smiled sardonically to himself, for he
knew that there was no hell hereafter. Reason told him that nothing
but oblivion, blacker and deeper than the depths beneath him, lay
beyond this hell that men called <quote>life</quote>.
   <p>Leaving the wheelhouse, Larsen glanced astern to where the wire
trawl-warps twanged and quivered away into the heaving night. <quote>Get
some weight on that after warp, bos'un!</quote> he bellowed. Going back
into the wheelhouse he scanned the echometer, <quote>Watch your steering,
blast you!</quote> he growled at the weary helmsman <quote>You're wandering
over the edge.</quote>
   <p>Tonight the haddock were shoaling massively in three hundred
fathoms, along the very edge of <quote>The Wall of Death</quote>. A little to
the westward of this sounding lay an abyss of eighteen hundred
fathoms, beyond the reach of any trawl and the haunt of alien species.
Here swam the snake-like Cyclothones, the rat-tailed Chimerae, the
swag-bellied Oceanic Angler fishes, useless monstrosities, armoured
against the cold depths with incredible slime and carrying their own
weird luminosity to light their mindless gropings in awful pressure
and a blackness beyond night. Larsen was not interested in marine
biology, only in profit.
   <p>The mate came into the wheelhouse. He was a young man whose eyes
were black holes of fatigue burned into his thin, dirty face. The
scarred and broken nailed fingers of his left hand were locked in the
handles of two grime-streaked mugs of tea, whilst his right hand
steadied him against the uneasy lurching of the ship.
   <p><quote>Have a mug o' lotion, skipper,</quote> he said hoarsely. Larsen
gulped the lye-strong, scalding fluid then rasped <quote>How are the
men?</quote>
   <p>The mate shrugged, knowing well that Larsen's concern was not
with the crew's welfare, merely with their ability to continue
working. <quote>They say that they're spragged, skipper, and that whether
you like it or not, they're stopping for a kip.</quote>
   <p>Larsen leaned out from the wheelhouse window, his out-thrust face
like that of a gargoyle <quote>Which of you... is stopping for a sleep?</quote>
His voice was hardly raised but it seemed to bite into the very
ice-bound fabric of the plunging ship. The men beneath him raised
their haggard faces and though dull hatred glimmered in their clouded
eyes, none spoke.
   <p><quote>Come on my lads</quote> he chided softly, a thick vein hammering in
his corded throat <quote>Who wants to sleep?... don't be afraid. Speak
up.</quote>
   <p>When nobody answered him he nodded as if satisfied <quote>Good. Any
more of that talk and I'll be down amongst you...</quote> his voice cracked
suddenly like a whip <quote>Now get back to work you ...s!</quote>
   <p>For a moment he watched them go, trying to flog the life back
into their frozen limbs. Then he spoke to the mate. <quote>How does the
fish tally stand?</quote>
   <p><quote>Fifty thousand stone of haddock, skipper. The holds are
full... a record catch.</quote>
   <p>Larsen's bitter face showed no jubilation <quote>This next haul will
be our last. That's all.</quote>
   <p>When the mate had gone Larsen went back to the open window, where
oblivious to the slashing, needle-pointed sleet, he stood with his
powerful legs braced against the motion of the ship. For an eternity,
it seemed he'd been at strife with the elements and at strife with
men. With axes and steam horses he had fought the creeping Black
Frosts which had tried to burden his ship with their deadly weight of
ice. With brain and furious strength he had fought the giant seas
which had licked men away like flies and threatened to engulf him.
With cruel fists and crueller words he had cowed crews made mutinous
by wicked overwork.
   <p>But memories he could not cow. They crept into his mind at
unguarded moments. He remembered the day on the Rockall Bank when he
had heaved down on the winch to free the trawl which was fast to some
obstruction two hundred fathoms down. The net had not come free and
he had heaved down like a madman, in spite of the lurching ship and
frightened glances of his men. He had heaved until the water lapped
the rail. Heaved until a massive iron bollard had exploded like a
bomb and the trawl-warp flailing clear of its captivity, had scythed
away a man's head. He remembered how the decapitated body had taken
three dreadful steps before it fell.
   <p>He remembered, too, the night off North Cape when only he had
dared fish whilst other craft lay hove-to for their lives in the
hurricane wind and giant seas. The ton-weight otter board of the net
had ripped free of its dog-chain and swinging inboard from the
fore-gallows, had crushed the boatswain to a pulp. Yet men called him
<quote>Lucky</quote> &mdash; a man whose wife, overwhelmed by loneliness, had left
him. A father whose grown children had long since become as strangers
to him.
   <p>In the tiny radio cabin behind the wheelhouse the radio operator
had switched on the receiver and a babel of voices and tongues broke
in on Larsen's thoughts. The skippers of many nations were asking for
instructions from their company offices; some were rejoicing in their
run of luck; others blasphemously cursing it. One voice was drowning
all the others with its ire. <quote>Lost all my nets but one and that's
ripped to doll rags... all for the sake of a lousy two hundred boxes
of fish. Won't clear my expenses! Over and out. Gone me...</quote>
   <p>A look of contemptuous amusement came to Larsen's face. He knew
the owner of that rancorous voice, it belonged to the skipper of the
trawler Valkyrie... DAN SCARDEN, a man known for his bitter
complaints.
   <p>Going into the radio cabin Larsen switched on the transmitter and
called <quote>Volsung to Valkyrie, Volsung to Valkyrie. D'ye
hear me Dan?... over.</quote>
   <p>He waited for an answer but none came.
   <p>Tapping the speaker in his hand Larsen called <quote>Volsung to
Valkyrie, Volsung to Valkyrie. Need a hearing aid, Dan? For
god's sake stop chafing and start fishing...</quote> he grinned maliciously
<quote>you can have a couple of my spare nets.

<text id=LOBN28>
<head>Begins today: dramatic story of a Scots girl sold as a slave</head>
<head>A GIFT FOR THE SULTAN</head>
   <p>THAT Scottish autumn of 1767 was a cold one. Ice rarely melted
in the rutted country lanes, and the fields and hills were permanently
blanketed in thick, white frost. Winter would come early and stay
long, and in a country poverty-stricken since the disastrous uprising,
the prospect was grim indeed.
   <p>With strange English landlords usurping their chieftains' seats,
the scattered clansmen were gradually deprived of home and hope.
Sheep were a paying proposition, men were not, so the new
<quote>lairds</quote> wanted land. By paying starvation prices for their
tenants' crops, and cruelly raising the cost of food and fuel and
rents, they got it.
   <p>Faced with eviction and worse, men despairing of their children's
future turned in their thousands to the bright New World that beckoned
from across the sea. It was heartbreaking to go, but worse to stay,
and soon every district had its share of deserted cottages and crofts.
   <p>Even in the tiny Aberdeenshire village of Mill o' Steps there
were smokeless chimneys and blank, unlighted doorways. But the
windows of the blacksmith's cottage on that cold September night
glowed warm and welcoming. In the living-room a blazing peat fire lit
up the red-gold hair of a young girl who stirred an iron soup-kettle
at the enormous hearth.
   <p>She was listening with more amusement than respect to the old
woman who sat hunched beside her, staring into the flames.
   <p><quote>You can laugh, my girl,</quote> the other reproved her. <quote>But the
day will come when you'll remember what I tell you now. You'll stand
where eagles fly &mdash;</quote>
   <p>From the scullery there came a sudden angry snort, and an
irritable voice called: <quote>Will you stop this nonsense at once, Morag
Paterson?</quote>
   <p>But the woman at the fire ignored her, and pressed on
unperturbed in her droning sing-song voice.
   <p><quote>You'll stand where no woman ever stood &mdash; and be in mortal
danger for it. And all about you there'll be cruelty undreamed of,
and those who would kill you if they could. But there's love
undreamed of for you, too, and some who'll live to serve you and die
to prove it. You'll walk with a man beside you that men bow down
to &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Mistress Paterson!</quote> the girl protested laughingly.
   <p>But the other nodded her head solemnly. <quote>Aye, it's the truth.
And you'll be so high and mighty &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>She's that already!</quote> The exasperated speaker appeared in the
doorway. <quote>Will you stop filling her head with such blether?</quote> she
demanded.
   <p><quote>Blether, is it, Jessie Gloag?</quote> retorted the other, stung.
<quote>And who was it sent for me to come and say what lies ahead?
Blether, indeed!</quote>
   <p>She turned to stare into the fire again.
   <p>Quietly she said: <quote>Nay, but it's true. She'll wear silks and
laces and ride where others will walk, and we that hear of it will
marvel at what comes to pass.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>THE girl beside her laughed again, her green eyes dancing
in the firelight.
   <p><quote>Och, Mistress Paterson &mdash; you should be telling fortunes at a
fair!</quote> she teased. <quote>It's rich you'd soon be, with such fine fates
for the asking!</quote>
   <p>Old Morag shrugged, but before she could say more the woman she
called Jessie turned on the younger one.
   <p><quote>What ails you, girl?</quote> she snapped. <quote>Himself will be in this
instant and never a drop of hot water to be had. Will you fetch the
bucket at once!</quote>
   <p>With a toss of her head, the girl flounced past her.
   <p><quote>Say <squote>if you please</squote> and I'll maybe send you a jewel from my
crown,</quote> she mocked and went, slamming the door behind her.
   <p>Jessie's face darkened and the older woman eyed her shrewdly.
   <p><quote>Don't be so hard on the lass, Jessie. It's envy that ails
you &mdash; envy that your man had a child by the wife before you. But
there'll be sons for you &mdash; aye, and happiness, too &mdash; when Helen's gone
from your sight.</quote> She sighed and turned back to the fire. <quote>And
that will be much sooner than you're thinking.</quote>
   <p><quote>It'll not come soon enough for me,</quote> retorted the other
ungraciously, and turned as Helen entered to berate her for leaving
the outside door ajar.
   <p><quote>I left it for himself,</quote> the girl replied, her manner suddenly
oddly subdued. <quote>He and Uncle Donald are just coming.</quote>
   <p>She had moved the soup-kettle to one side and now began to fill
the cauldron on the hob. But at the sound of footsteps on the path
outside she half turned to the doorway, slopping the water badly as
she did so.
   <p><quote>Land sakes, will you look what you're about!</quote> her irate
stepmother exploded, as Andrew Gloag entered the room.
   <p><quote>Och, hold your whisht, woman,</quote> he said irritably. <quote>We'll
have none of you scowls and scolds on my brother's last night with his
family.</quote>
   <p>Flushing, she turned on him. But before she could retort, she
saw him slump heavily into a chair, and there was something in his
attitude that silenced her.
   <p>Watching him from the fireside, Helen was suddenly wildly elated.
Forcing herself to be calm, she set the bucket down carefully and
then stood to face him, her hands pressed together to still their
trembling.
   <p>For a long moment he sat silent and she glanced nervously at the
young man who had followed him in. Reassured by his nod, she waited
to meet her father's gaze, steeling herself against the remorse she
knew she would feel at hurting him.
   <p>
   <p>AT last, with a shake of his head, Andrew raised his eyes
to hers.
   <p><quote>It's really what you want, lass?</quote> he said quietly. And,
seeing the answer so clearly in her face, added in the same tone:
<quote>Then that will be the way of it.</quote>
   <p><quote>America!</quote> she breathed, and for a moment could not make
herself consider how her delight must wound him, compunction killed by
the realisation of a thousand dreams.
   <p><quote>You're sure you know what you're about, lass?</quote> he said,
eyeing her searchingly. <quote>Turning your back on all you've ever
known &mdash; have you thought you'll likely never see your family or
friends again?</quote>
   <p><quote>I know it all, father. But I must go &mdash; I must go!</quote>
   <p>He sighed heavily. <quote>And you will leave with Donald in the
morning?</quote>
   <p><quote>If you will let me.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>FOR Jessie, this sudden turn of events seemed too good to
be true. But as she saw the dispirited sag of her husband's shoulders
she forced herself to speak to Helen.
   <p><quote>You've no call to be leaving home,</quote> she said, and flushed as
she added, <quote>if it's ought that I've said or done &mdash;</quote>
   <p>But old Morag cut across her words.
   <p><quote>The kitchen's not been built that will hold two women &mdash; it's
not your fault or the lass's. And don't you glare at me, Andrew
Gloag! Your girl is seventeen and she'd be away from home soon
enough, one way or the other.</quote>
   <p>Donald spoke for the first time. <quote>She'll take no harm with me,
Andrew. I'm sure you know it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Och, man, don't speak of it,</quote> his brother answered.
   <p>With an effort he smiled, and it broke the tension. Helen
crossed to him and, in a rare show of affection, bent to kiss his
cheek.
   <p><quote>Uncle Donald must have someone to cook and clean and keep house
for him,</quote> she said eagerly. <quote>And maybe he'll make a fine fortune
and marry &mdash; and then he can buy me a passage to come back to see
you.</quote>
   <p>She glanced hopefully at Morag, expecting support. But the old
woman turned again to stare into the fire.
   <p><quote>All that's as maybe,</quote> she said flatly. <quote>But you'll not
change what's to come, though you talk till you drop. You'll follow
the path that's been laid for you &mdash; aye, and Donald will follow
his.</quote>
   <p>Sleep was a long time coming to Helen that night. There had been
so much to talk about, so much to plan. It was only when she was
alone at last in the curtained comfort of her wall cot that she could
think at all clearly.
   <p>She had grown up in the knowledge that a large part of her
father's fondness for her was on account of her remarkable likeness to
the mother she had hardly known. Now she suddenly saw that her
absence might well be the best thing for them all.
   <p>She had been touched and troubled by Jessie's obvious effort at
conciliation, and knew it for what it was &mdash; a gesture of
self-sacrifice for the man she loved. The evening's excitement seemed
somehow to have brought a sharper awareness of her own thoughts and
emotions, and now, ashamed, she realised that she had never before
given a moment's consideration to Jessie's.
   <p>It could not have been easy to try to take the place of an adored
memory. And with a spoiled child to contend with as well, it must
have seemed an almost hopeless task. She flushed suddenly in the
darkness, remembering the times without number when she had
deliberately scored off the young stepmother, childishly flaunting her
ability to wheedle all she wanted from her doting father.
   <p>She could see again Jessie's odd, strained expression at such
times &mdash; and suddenly she recalled another face, another expression,
and her cheeks grew even hotter. Uncle Donald.
   <p>
   <p>SEVERAL times in recent weeks she had caught his
thoughtful, measuring gaze on her after some sharp exchange between
herself and Jessie, and now she suddenly knew without any doubt that
this was his reason for taking her away. Not because he needed her or
particularly wanted her company, but because he thought the situation
unfair to Jessie.
   <p>It was Jessie who awakened her in the morning &mdash; a strangely
different, quieter Jessie.
   <p>For the moment, they were alone: the two men were over at the
smithy and old Morag was washing at the pump in the yard.
   <p>In the light of her new understanding, Helen would have dearly
liked to take advantage of the moment and wipe out all past trouble
between them. But in her inexperience she found it difficult even to
act at all naturally.
   <p>Then Jessie placed a bowl of porridge on the table and pushed
Helen's own horn spoon towards it, and this small courtesy undid them
both.
   <p>After mumbling her thanks, the younger woman sat red-faced and
unmoving until the other suddenly said in a tired voice: <quote>I've not
been much of a mother to you, Helen. You'd not be wanting to go away
from your home if I had.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's not that,</quote> Helen said lamely, then tried again: <quote>I've
not been much of a daughter to you, come to that.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>JESSIE appeared not to have heard.
   <p><quote>I meant to be, dear knows. There were plenty to say I'd rue
the day, but I wouldn't listen. So certain sure I was that God had
put me here on earth to care for Andrew Gloag and his child that
nobody could tell me different. And now just look what it's come
to!</quote>
   <p>She sat down suddenly and faced Helen across the table.
   <p><quote>You'll break his heart if you go, you know that?</quote>
   <p>Helen shook her head, all uncertainty amazingly gone.
   <p><quote>No. I thought about it, last night. I think it's best for
everybody.</quote>
   <p>As Jessie looked at her oddly, she hurried on: <quote>I realised a
lot of things, last night. Things I should have thought of sooner.</quote>
   <p>Embarrassed, she said: <quote>I was thinking, you couldn't have been
much above my age when &mdash; when you &mdash;</quote>
   <p>She broke off. She could not have said <quote>married my father</quote>
for the life of her. She knew what marriage entailed, and only now
did it occur to her that there could have been little of true marriage
between Andrew Gloag and his second wife.
   <p><quote>I was sixteen,</quote> said Jessie, quietly.
   <p><quote>Sixteen!</quote> Helen repeated, startled.
   <p>From the doorway, old Morag said: <quote>Aye, but she'll not be
twice that before she's bouncing her first-born on her knee.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't talk so daft, woman!</quote> Jessie said, with a return of her
old spirit.

<head>THE GUN</head>
<head>BY HARRY RICHMAN</head>
<head>A very short story that is not what it seems</head>
   <p>GINO stopped pacing the floor and walked over to the
sideboard. Gently, he pulled open the middle drawer and stared at the
huge black Luger that was once his father's, lying serenely in the
farthest corner. Still without a sound, he closed his huge brown hand
over the cold steel, and hastily transferred it to his jacket pocket.
A few seconds later his wife walked into the room.
   <p><squote>Gino, what are you doing?</squote>
   <p><squote>Nothing! &mdash; Thinking.</squote> He walked away from the drawer and
put his hands in his pockets to stop them from trembling.
   <p><squote>Why you no think about getting the work?</squote> She wiped her
hands on a dirty apron. <squote>Thinking &mdash; walking up &mdash; down... No food
in the house, what you think about that, huh? You gotta any plans
about that? We'd be better if we stay in Viareggio.</squote> She wiped
an imaginary tear from her rosy cheek.
   <p><squote>You wanna go back to Viareggio &mdash; go! I no stop you. I stay
here. Go back if you wanna go. You think I no try and get the work,
huh? What you think &mdash; you think I no try?</squote>
   <p>Gino turned and stalked out of the house. A hard, loud slam of
the door stopped his wife's voluble Italian adjectives from following
him out.
   <p>
   <p>Ever since he'd lost his job two weeks ago, they'd done nothing
but squabble. He pulled out a cigarette packet and stared
disconsolately at the last Woodbine. He placed it carefully between
his lips and lit it. He winced as the empty packet landed in the
gutter. Food he could manage without for a few days, but
cigarettes... He inhaled deeply and kept the smoke inside of him for
as long as he could.
   <p>He walked all morning. In the afternoon it began to drizzle.
Gino pulled his jacket collar up high and for the umpteenth time
placed his hand on the Luger. He felt nervous and undecided. He
glanced up at a clock hanging over a jeweller's shop. It was four
o'clock &mdash; he had time. He decided to wait in a doorway for the rain
to stop. He wanted to think.
   <p>He wouldn't go back to Viareggio. If she wanted to go, let her.
He dug into his pocket for a cigarette, and was irritated when only a
box of matches came out. His irritation made him think about his
wife's mother: <squote>I don't let you to take my daughter to London. A
daughter's place is by her mother &mdash; you no right &mdash; you no right to
take my bambino away.</squote> She'd gone on and on, even when the train
moved off she was still shouting.
   <p>He wouldn't go back, no matter what. He ran his hand over the
gun and the anger he felt subsided slightly. He'd show her. He'd
show everybody.
   <p>Gino moved out of the doorway into the drizzle, that showed no
signs of stopping. It was four-thirty and plans had better be made.
His face was covered with thoughtful wrinkles as he walked steadily
forward.
   <p>
   <p>From time to time his deep concentration was floored by the aroma
of hot coffee from the many caf&eacute;s. The smells of fresh bread and
fried chicken caused his stomach to scream in anguish. Cigarette
smoke seemed to find his nose from all of a hundred different brands.
He dug his nails deeper into the palms of his hands, as his head
began to reel. Frantically he swallowed huge gulps of air and then
closed his eyes to help stop the buildings from going round and round.
   <p>In desperation, he branched off into an alley-way, and there,
breathing heavily, and by now almost wet through, he waited for peace
to return.
   <p>It was now five. Gino wiped his face and head with an old
handkerchief. It had stopped drizzling, and he was annoyed at having
allowed himself to be soaked. He squeezed the water from his
handkerchief and strode forward. His mind was made up.
   <p>He walked straight toward a little shop he had once seen in one
of the many side streets that ran like arteries off Soho's more public
thoroughfares. There were only a few people about. Some fifty yards
from the shop, he put his hand on the Luger and made it feel
comfortable.
   <p>An old woman stopped to look into the shop's windows. Gino
hesitated. The gun was heavy in his pocket. The whole left side of
his body seemed to feel the weight. The old lady went away.
   <p>Gino moistened his lips. He'd never done anything like this
before. He uttered a swift, silent prayer, finishing with <squote>dear
Father and Mother, please forgive me.</squote> His forehead was covered in
perspiration. He arrived at the door and stopped.
   <p>He couldn't go through with it. He was from a good family. The
name Farrari was known all over Italy. If the news ever got back
home &mdash; he shuddered.
   <p>He moved to the corner of the quiet little street and watched a
light come on in the small shop. <squote>Dear God,</squote> whispered Gino,
<squote>what shall I do?</squote> The gun was beginning to feel heavier and
heavier.
   <p>
   <p>Suddenly, he knew what he must do. His face grim, his demeanour
calm, he again walked forward. What did he care what anybody thought
or said! No one worried about him. Nobody cared. He stalked into
the shop and stopped three yards from the counter.
   <p>There were two men inside. The older one was putting something
away on a shelf. Gino put his hand on the gun and walked toward the
fat one, who was reading the evening paper.
   <p>With a short, jerky movement, he drew the Luger from his pocket.
His hand shook, and he felt sick with shame.
   <p><squote>How...,</squote> he put the gun on the counter, <squote>how much you
give me for this, please?</squote>
<head>COMMUNICATION</head>
   <p>Terror roared at his family out of the lonely night. But no
one could help him, in his agonising struggle to save them &mdash; and prove
himself.
<head>BY A. E. TREPPASS</head>
<head>Illustration by Bernard Blatch</head>

   <p>THE large illuminated sign at the road side etched its
message sharply in the cool darkness:
   <p>STOP &mdash; ONE HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD &mdash; FOR THE LAST CUP OF TEA FOR
MILES.
   <p>Charles Corran smiled and remembered the red brick caf&eacute; with
its rose garden and gravel car park. They had been tempted to stop
there at the beginning of their holiday. Now, late, on the way home,
he was more than tempted. Besides, just beyond the caf&eacute; lay the
twenty-mile long, lonely road across Rannet Moors; a wearisome
journey, particularly so late at night when all he wanted to do was
doze over the steering column.
   <p>He slowed the car and turned to Meg, his wife. In the half light
she looked tired and a little sad. It had been a good holiday and
they had all been reluctant to leave the sea and the sun.
   <p><squote>Shall we?</squote> he asked.
   <p>She nodded lazily and stirred in her seat, enough to glance at
the two children who were snuggled sleepily in the back.
   <p>Tony, who was five and precocious, opened his eyes and murmured:
   <p><squote>Shall we what, Daddy?</squote>
   <p><squote>Have a cup of tea,</squote> Meg replied.
   <p><squote>I want orange,</squote> Belle informed them, with all the authority
of her eleven years.
   <p><squote>With a straw,</squote> Tony added.
   <p><squote>Good.</squote> Charles signalled that he was turning left, and, at
the very moment he nosed into the caf&eacute; car park, there was a noise
beside them like an aero engine and two unsilenced motor cycles
carrying black, helmeted figures roared right across his path,
spraying gravel over his bonnet.
   <p>He braked instantly and the steering wheel hit his chest and he
gasped. Meg cried out as her head bumped the windscreen and Tony
began to sob on the floor.
   <p><squote>The devils! The fiendish devils!</squote> Meg snapped as she leant
over the back seat to help Belle gather Tony into her arms.
   <p>Charles said nothing. He realized he had heard the motorcycles
approaching and he knew they had had time to see his signal. He
waited until his family were settled, then he accelerated into the car
park. He caught the motorcycles and the riders in the full glare of
his headlights, braked and slipped purposefully out of the car.
   <p><squote>Don't!</squote> Meg pleaded, but he ignored her.
   <p>He had the acrid taste of fear in his mouth and his chest ached.
His legs were rubbery but he was angry. He pulled his tired body off
the rack of the long, weary drive from Dorset and clenched his fists.
   <p>The riders were standing beside their motorcycles waiting for
him. They were dressed from head to foot in black; black leggings,
boots, zipper jacket, goggles. Their manner was as insolent as the
startling white skull and crossbones on each black crash helmet.
   <p>They were young and Charles wanted to lash out at them.
   <p><squote>You maniacs!</squote> he snapped, and they stared at him.
   <p><squote>Turn the light out, Mister,</squote> the slighter one drawled. <squote>It
hurts my eyes.</squote>
   <p>
   <p>HE stood a yard away from them and tried to feel he was
towering over them, but they were as tall, or even taller than he.
   <p>He tried to control his fury and his hammering heart by taking a
deep, slow breath.
   <p><squote>You crazy lunatics,</squote> he said, and his voice sounded strange
and weak. <squote>You'll kill someone someday .</squote>
   <p>One of them laughed; a sharp, hysterical sound. The other spat.
   <p><squote>So what? As long as it isn't you why should you worry?</squote>
   <p>Charles stepped forward, incensed beyond reason. Instantly the
taller thrust his body forward and warned viciously:
   <p><squote>You touch me, mate and I'll call the cops.</squote>
   <p>Amazed, Charles hesitated, and the taller one sensed his
advantage. He flipped Charles' tie out, turned and caught his
companion's arm.
   <p><squote>C'mon, boy. Let's blow! Man, this fella's a drag!</squote>
   <p>Charles watched them strut into the doorway of the caf&eacute; and
realized his inadequacy. There was no way in which he could
communicate with them. They were in their own, arrogant, teenage
world; a world of curt questions and harsh answers, of sudden
irrational impulses; a world that had changed radically in the twenty
years since he had left it.
   <p>At the car he was faced with the silence of his family. He
sensed their fear, saw Meg's sharp, shadowed profile, saw Belle
sitting tense, wide awake, her arm round Tony.
   <p>It was Tony who spoke first.
   <p><squote>What did the man do, Daddy?</squote>
   <p><squote>Hush!</squote> Meg silenced him quickly, but he would have felt
better if she had said nothing. He wanted no protection from someone
weaker than himself.
   <p><squote>Nothing,</squote> he said and tucked the tie back inside his jacket.
   <p>Meg watched him, then held the car door for him and his anger
switched to her. He was not an invalid. But he checked himself, held
the anger back, and slid into the driving seat.
   <p><squote>Shall we go on?</squote> she asked and it was really a request, not a
question.
   <p>He nodded. Twenty miles across Rannet Moor, through Bisset and
Scowlea, then home. He could wait an hour for a cup of tea.
   <p><squote>I want some orange,</squote> Tony begged, and Meg soothed him.
   <p><squote>Hush, darling. When we get home. There isn't any here.</squote>
   <p><squote>But daddy didn't ask,</squote> the boy insisted.
   <p><squote>He did,</squote> Meg replied easily as Charles switched on the
engine.
   <p>He drove the first five miles along the black ribbon of the moor
road carefully, in silence. He was ashamed and he felt that all his
family, even Tony, were ashamed of him. Slowly his body calmed and
his brain cooled, but he wanted home; the touch and sight and smell of
familiar things.
   <p>He tried to tell himself that the car was an extension of home
and that while he was in it nothing more could go wrong. But the
moors were a cold, uneasy waste where every bush and shadow and dark
rise hid watching eyes and alien fingers.
   <p>Suddenly Meg nudged him gently and he glanced in the rear view
mirror.

<head>CHAPTER 29</head>
   <p>THE BLACK CANDLE Saturday night cellar party was on. The time
was approaching midnight. Margot and Jasmine had left together
shortly after ten. Before doing so at Mr. Copthorne's invitation
they had spent a pleasant half hour with Con O'Shea, Mr. Butler and
Mr. Narain Khuma at a table for four. At another table nearby Mr.
Smith and two of his officers in plain clothes were quietly chatting
together.
   <p>Ordinary members had quitted the club premises which appeared to
be closed and only Percy, weary and fed up was compelled to stay in
his ill-lit little cubby hole still on duty after hours until Mr.
Herman gave him permission to depart.
   <p>Saturnalia was about to proceed within that profane cellar. A
black cock and a white hen had passed through the flames and to quench
the unpleasant stink of burnt carcases and feathers, Mr. Copthorne
in his purple and scarlet Bardic robes and peculiar turbanned
headdress, had been swinging about an incense censer. The air was
heavy and thick with the combined smells.
   <p>Mr. Herman, who had been absent for a short while, entered very
hurriedly by the back stairway leading from the kitchen premises. His
face was as white as the damask deeply lace-edged cloth spread over
the refectory table on which stood the golden chalice from which all
had drunk and drained. He whispered hurriedly to his chief.
   <p><quote>We're cornered. Not a hope unless we can get them all away by
the side entrance.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Copthorne turned grey.
   <p>Without any waiting, panic-stricken and regardless of the rest,
he made a scuttling exit through the cloak-room door leading out on to
the side entrance.
   <p>Mr. Herman took over with one word.
   <p><quote>Scram!</quote>
   <p>Fright and alarm spread amongst the party guests and in the
sudden confusion to press through the narrow doorway a paraffin
radiator just under the purple and scarlet muslin draped platform was
upset followed by an explosion and a burst of flame, instantly
igniting the draperies and matching curtains at the sides. Seizing a
piece of carpeting Mr. Herman attempted to smother and quench them.
There was a fire extinguisher, but that was kept in the club itself
for handy use. The flames spread and mounted. He staggered up the
back stairway into his office and dialled 999.
   <p>As he came out of it, Mr. Smith and his two companions came
round the side of the rostrum where they had been concealing
themselves, and stood in the way.
   <p>Mr. Herman faced them. He had been trembling and shaking. He
ceased to tremble. He stood rigid and straight. He was on the stage
once again and it was the first night of a new play in which he had
been cast for the minor role of an evil man's dupe and confederate.
Could he have cast himself in the part of Mr. Copthorne, the
villain and apostate, he would not have attempted to run away from his
captors. He would have made his appearance. The Show must go on.
   <p>His first night nerves on this that was also his last night
dropped away from him. He had lines to speak.
   <p>Mr. Smith gave him his cue.
   <p><quote>Now then, Herman!</quote>
   <p>Mr. Herman's faintly mask-like smile was almost pathetic.
   <p><quote>Gentlemen, of course, I am at your service, but listen to me,
please.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't take too long then,</quote> said Mr. Smith.
   <p><quote>I will be brief. Can you not smell smoke? Turn your noses to
the kitchen.</quote> The men sniffed and coughed.
   <p><quote>Is that your trick?</quote> snapped Mr. Smith. <quote>Trying to smoke
us out, eh? Been burning something? You'll have to think of
something better than that. Show us the way below.</quote>
   <p><quote>Impossible. No doing of mine. A pure accident. One of these
paraffin lamps has been upset. The premises are on fire. I have just
phoned for the brigade. Arrest me. Whatever information you wish me
to give you later I am willing to provide. I am a knave and a low
fellow, a spreader of iniquity. I have no intention of scarpering
even if I had the chance. I have had enough to last me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Tail it off, Herman!</quote> Mr. Smith and his men were now
uncomfortably aware that Mr. Herman was speaking the truth and that
the club was on fire. <quote>Where's Copthorne?</quote>
   <p><quote>My leader in this fiendish racket, my dear sir, is not in the
house. He is well on his way by now to where I do not know, but even
if I did know for certain and told you, I doubt if you would be able
to catch up with his Rover 90 as he has had a good start. It might
conceivably be down to Sussex or to the nearest airport. You will be
much better advised to take me into custody forthwith and lock me up
once more in the all too familiar confines of a prison cell.</quote>
   <p><quote>You are under arrest.</quote> Mr. Smith coughed as a swirl of
acrid smoke drifted past him and his officers.
   <p>Mr. Herman held out his hands.
   <p><quote>Put on the bangles. The fire brigade has arrived. Hear it?
Regis Road pavements will soon be crowded with late-homers 
gathering to witness a fire in full bloom. Standing room only for
nothing to pay. I pray you let me continue to speak the tag. I
played Hamlet once and how I gloried in that role although the
performance only took place in a country public hall &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>That's enough, Herman.</quote>
   <p>The firemen were in, Percy, Con O'Shea and Mr. Butler were all
upon the scene.
   <p>Mr. Herman raised his voice above the hubbub and roar of smoke
and flames. Infinite pathos, regret and sadness was in it.
   <p><quote>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable seem all the uses of
this world! It is an unweeded garden that grows to seed. Things rank
and gross in nature possess it &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Pipe down!</quote> The two police officers hustled him forward
towards the entrance.
   <p>Con suddenly brushed past them.
   <p><quote>The cat, the white cat!</quote>
   <p>Percy tried to hold him back. So did Mr. Butler.
   <p><quote>The cat will have got itself out through the coal-shoot. Bound
to &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>It hasn't. I heard it mewing. I am sure and certain it was
the cat &mdash; let go of me, George!</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't be a fool, Con!</quote>
   <p><quote>Get outside, all of you, unless you want to be smothered, and
wait for me. I'll be joining you in a minute or two with the little
white cat in me arms!</quote> Con pushed himself free and dashed
forward.
<head>CHAPTER 30</head>
   <p>THE SPEED dash into Sussex was near to its end. The titled
displaced person chauffeur who was at the wheel, intent on the wheel
and covering distance, had not spoken a word. Nearing the village he
turned to look for Mr. Copthorne in the back of the car. He was not
on the seat. He was cowering on the floor.
   <p><quote>Stop!</quote>
   <p><quote>Do you not wish to be driven home?</quote>
   <p><quote>No. Put me down at the church.</quote>
   <p><quote>Very good.</quote> The chauffeur did not <squote>Sir</squote> his employer.
   <p>He halted the car by the Lych Gate.
   <p><quote>Thank you.</quote> Mr. Copthorne almost fell out of it, his
Bardic robes impeding him. <quote>I will see you in the morning.</quote>
   <p><quote>Perhaps.</quote>
   <p><quote>Perhaps. But &mdash; but you are not going to leave me, Count? You
know how I rely on your services.</quote>
   <p>The chauffeur did not deign to answer. He was self-possessed and
silent as always.
   <p>He opened the Lych Gate for Mr. Copthorne, closed it after him
and drove away.
   <p>Mr. Copthorne stumbled towards the church door and tried to
turn the heavy handle. It was locked. The verger would be there to
open it first thing in the morning. The rector liked to leave the
church open all day until the evening. He was very proud of the
venerable old edifice with its Norman tower. It would be made good
and sound, the restoration of its stone and wood that would ensure its
preservation for many many years to come, by means of the generous
purse of Mr. Copthorne, squire, and lord of the manor.
   <p>Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side of the church where
there was a small open outbuilding where the grave digger kept his
spades and forks and tidying up implements. It might be open. It
was. He entered, and seated himself in a huddle upon an upturned
wheelbarrow. His curious headgear fell off.
   <p>Strange things were going on in his bewildered brain. When a man
was drowning and towards his last gasp it was scientifically supposed
his whole life came up before him in some cinematic kind of sequence.
Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church outbuilding, but this was
happening to him now. He saw himself as a sulky, ugly, malformed,
repressed boy, then a young youth. He saw himself refusing baptism
according to the sect his parents belonged to. Walking out of the
chapel later on. Continuing on, his leaping mind flashed pictures of
chicanery and corruption, the growth of the deadly decadence and
absorption in debasement and Satanic debauchery. He saw himself as he
was and as he had become, a misbegotten, infamous, recidivist, past
praying for.
   <p>The church clock was striking seven. He had slipped on to the
stone floor. He gathered himself, swaying and uncertain and stumbled
round to the front door of the church again. The door was open. The
verger had just unlocked it and was about to depart when he saw Mr.
Copthorne entering in his very strange purple and scarlet robes
get-up. He didn't know what to make of it, but it was Mr. Copthorne
all right. Perhaps he had been attending some kind of fancy dress do
in London. Very strange his eyes looked. Mad, hunted eyes, as if the
poor fellow had rocks in his head, so the verger described afterwards.
   <p><quote>You're very early about, sir,</quote> he said, trying to speak
normally.
   <p><quote>Yes. I travelled down from London as the dawn was breaking,
and the thought came to me I'd like to take a look at the church.
I've never been inside. Very remiss of me,</quote> said Mr. Copthorne.
   <p>The verger led the way in.
   <p><quote>The stained glass windows, sir, they date back to the
fourteenth century.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Copthorne looked and saw the light stealing through upon
the illuminated figures of Saints and a central figure upon a Cross.
   <p><quote>Ah!</quote> he said. <quote>That figure &mdash; that Man wasn't afraid to die,
was he?</quote>
   <p>The verger was simple in his nature.
   <p><quote>No, sir. He died for all.</quote>
   <p><quote>And Christianity goes on!</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, sir, and always will.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Copthorne's breathing was deep and laboured. He seemed to
be sighing.
   <p><quote>I'd like to go up to the belfry. Don't come with me. I'd like
to go myself.</quote> The verger waited for him by the Lych Gate.
   <p>Mr. Copthorne ascended into the belfry. The verger could see
him standing there on the very edge. A bit risky. The next moment he
had either cast himself down or stumbled and fallen.
   <p>There he lay stretched out, his fat figure in a crude
spread-eagle, face forward.
   <p>The verger ran towards him. He tried to shift the unwieldy
figure and raise him.
   <p>Mr. Copthorne's head fell sideways. Very faintly, in a bare
murmur, the verger caught the last words he uttered:
   <p><quote>I am still baffled.</quote>
<head>CHAPTER 31</head>
   <p>ON SUNDAY afternoon a telephone message was conveyed to Margot
by Miss Maclaren, very quietly, on the fourth floor landing. Her
father was having his Sunday afternoon nap and the considerate little
woman did not wish to disturb him.
   <p><quote>A gentleman whose name is Mr. Butler, has just rung up to say
he has some urgent news for you and Jasmine, and he is coming round
now in his car with a friend to tell you. His voice sounded very
grave, dear, and he stressed that as it was on a subject that might
upset your father, it would be best to say nothing to him yet awhile.
Jasmine is getting herself ready now.

<text id=LOBP02>
   <p>There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was quickly
through the customs. <quote>Gay!</quote>
   <p><quote>Gavin!</quote>
   <p>The girl and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
together. The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the taxi. <quote>Just a
moment, darling,</quote> Gavin pressed her hand and smiled. <quote>I want to
check up on the flights back.</quote>
   <p>Gay went out to the waiting taxi, and then found that in the
excitement of meeting Gavin she had left her sun-glasses on the
veranda. She went quickly back to fetch them. Gavin and the girl who
had got off the plane with him were talking. He was writing something
in his pocket-book, with a sick feeling of despair Gay knew that of
course it was her address.
   <p>Gavin joined her and at once dispelled her fears.
   <p><quote>That little bit you saw me talking to, her father is a big land
agent, she says that he sometimes has farms for lease ... you know
that's what I want, Gay, a farm and you!</quote>
   <p>
   <p><quote>Shall we go over to the little caf&eacute; opposite after
dinner?</quote> Gay, sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could hardly
believe that she was the same girl, miserable, shy, who had sat at the
little table for the first time a few days ago.
   <p>Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled and Gay's heart turned
over. <quote>I'd like to do that.</quote> Gavin drained his glass and refilled
it. <quote>And then we'll go for a stroll along the beach. A moon like
this mustn't be wasted.</quote> He gestured towards the bay where the full
moon was just rising over the rocks, then laid his hand on hers.
   <p>Gay smiled at him again, happy beyond belief, knowing that now
Gavin was in love with her and her only, yet remembering for a second
the kisses she had seen him giving Elaine. All that was part of the
past, she would put it behind her. She would never be jealous again,
would even take Larry's advice and look the other way if need be.
   <p><quote>I say!</quote> Gavin was looking over her shoulder. <quote>That's a
pretty girl!</quote>
   <p>Gay glanced behind her, <quote>Isn't she lovely, she's French, a very
well known model I believe. She only arrived today. That is her
father's yacht in the bay. The people she is with are the Belgians I
told you about who have been so nice to me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Does everyone go to the caf&eacute; opposite after dinner?</quote> Gavin
enquired casually.
   <p><quote>No, the older people usually stay here and have coffee and some
go to the night club up the road.</quote>
   <p>Bernice came over and was introduced. Gay felt happy and proud
as she made the introduction. <quote>We are going to the night club,</quote>
Bernice said, <quote>are you coming?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, we thought that we'd go opposite.</quote> Gay didn't want to do
anything other than be alone with Gavin and later under the light of
the glorious moon hear his explanation of everything and in shared
kisses put it all behind her.
   <p>They came out of dinner and Gay went upstairs to get her stole,
the night was warm, the sky cloudless, but it might be cooler later on
the beach.
   <p>She looked at herself in the mirror, wanting so much to look
lovely for Gavin. She lightly powdered her face, drew a pale lipstick
across her mouth, picked up her stole and ran down the stairs to where
she had left him.
   <p>The hall was empty, and she looked round thinking that perhaps
Gavin had gone outside when Larry came through, tall and elegant in
his white dinner jacket.
   <p><quote>Hullo, you're looking very lovely.</quote>
   <p><quote>Thank you, Larry, I'm feeling very happy.</quote>
   <p><quote>You are? Good girl. Everything all right now?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh yes, thanks a lot for your advice. Gavin is here! and
before I had time to write!</quote>
   <p><quote>Here? You mean the man you were dining with is Gavin?</quote> Larry
asked, looking surprised.
   <p><quote>Yes, isn't it wonderful? He flew over from Barcelona and is
going to stay two days. I can't think where he is, he said he would
wait here.</quote> She looked around.
   <p><quote>He's in the bar ...</quote> Larry looked at her a little strangely,
paused as if he were going to say something, then with a wave of his
hand walked off to join a smart looking woman.
   <p>Gay, a little puzzled, went through to the bar. Doc and Lilyan
were sitting just inside having coffee. <quote>Come and join us and bring
your boy friend,</quote> Doc called.
   <p><quote>No, Doc!</quote> Lilyan remonstrated. <quote>They want to be alone.</quote>
   <p><quote>I've booked a table at the caf&eacute;,</quote> Doc said, <quote>they are
packed tonight so come and join us if you can't find a table for
two.</quote>
   <p>Gay thanked him and walked out on to the terrace thinking that
perhaps Gavin had bought a drink and taken it outside.
   <p>She looked round scanning the tables, then caught her breath, a
cold hand seeming to clutch her heart.
   <p>Gavin was seated at a small table in a shadowy corner talking
animatedly to Simone. As Gay watched he offered the girl a cigarette
and lit it, his hands cupping hers in an intimate way.
   <p>Gay stood irresolute for a moment, half decided to go back and
join Lilyan and Doc, while she wanted to do no more than run upstairs
to her room, knowing that Gavin although he had told her that he loved
her, was already flirting with a girl that he had only met a few
minutes before. Larry's advice flashed through her mind, but she
turned away, giving a little gesture of hopelessness, knowing that her
pride would never allow her to look the other way and aware too, that
her love for Gavin had already lessened, although she was suffering
the pangs of jealousy.
   <p><quote>Gay!</quote> Gavin came up behind her and took her arm, <quote>where have
you been?</quote> Simone stood behind him, cool and poised.
   <p><quote>Come along,</quote> he took them both by the arm, <quote>now show me
where this caf&eacute; is.</quote>
   <p>Gay withdrew her arm on the pretext of adjusting her stole,
almost shuddering at Gavin's touch.
   <p>The caf&eacute; was crowded as Doc had predicted and Gay led them
over to his table, glad that she was not to be alone with Gavin. The
others were all dancing and as Gay drew out a chair and sat down
Gavin, without a word, swept Simone on to the floor.
   <p><quote>It doesn't mean anything,</quote> Gay told herself desperately,
trying to understand Gavin's point of view and remembering the advice
that Larry had given her, while she felt wretched beyond words. She
shivered a little despite the warmth of the night and turning round,
reached for her stole which was on the back of the chair. Without
meaning to spy she caught sight of Gavin and Simone. They were
dancing very closely and she saw Gavin lay his cheek against the
French girl's and whisper something in her ear. Simone looked up at
him smiling and nodded.
   <p>Feeling sick with unhappiness, Gay drank her coffee, aware now as
she had really known before that there was no hope of happiness in the
future for her and Gavin. If he could come all the way to Marjorca to
see her and then immediately start flirting with the first pretty girl
that he met, and in front of her, it showed only too plainly that his
affection for her had no depths at all. His behaviour was not only
boorish and in the worst of taste but it was unkind beyond words. She
fumbled with the cigarette packet which lay on the table not wanting
to smoke but needing some action to help her control her feelings.
   <p><quote>Come and dance,</quote> Doc's cheery voice came as a lifeline and
Gay got up quickly, managing a smile.
   <p>As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin and Simone go
through the doorway that led down to the beach. Gay closed her eyes
for a moment in disgust. She was fully aware that Gavin would make
love to the French girl on the sands, and no doubt he would come back
soon and after Simone had left expect her to accept his kisses on the
way back to the hotel.
   <p><quote>And that's the man whom you have been eating your heart out
over?</quote> Doc nodded towards the door. <quote>You may consider him a man,
I would say he was a mentally adolescent cad.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, Doc ...</quote> Gay protested weakly, <quote>you don't know Gavin.</quote>
   <p><quote>I've only met him today but I think I can safely say that I
know him a great deal better than you do.</quote> Doc gave her hand a
shake. <quote>Wake up Gay, and don't even contemplate throwing yourself
away on a chap like that. You're a fine girl, intelligent, and
pretty, and I had thought you were sensible too. Don't make a fool of
yourself over someone who doesn't care two jots for your feelings. If
he behaves like this now what is your married life going to be like?
Hell.</quote> Doc answered for her. <quote>Just Hell. Never able to trust
him out of your sight and having to put on a brave face and pretend
that you don't mind whenever he flirts with another woman. He will
you know, always, and you aren't the type who is tough enough to
change him.</quote>
   <p>Gay nodded. <quote>I know that you're right Doc, I think now that I
do realise that, and in any case,</quote> she added a little sadly, <quote>if I
did change Gavin, he wouldn't be the same, if you know what I mean.</quote>
   <p><quote>You sound like Alice in Wonderland,</quote> Doc gently mocked her,
<quote>and I'm glad you're beginning to see that you're wasting your time
on that chap. Now let him go and you won't have to wait long for the
right man for you to come along. If I was thirty years younger and
weren't married to the sweetest wife in the world I'd marry you
myself.</quote> Gay laughed, Doc was so kind and nice and she hoped that
one day she would be able to see the situation as it obviously
appeared to everyone else.
   <p>Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once again Gay found herself alone
at the table feeling self-conscious and awkward, sure that people were
talking about the way Gavin was behaving since they had seen them
dining together. She opened her bag to get out her compact and saw
Grace's letter. She drew it out and opened it, glad to be able to
occupy herself.
   <p><quote>So glad that you are having such a lovely time, dearie,</quote> it
ran. <quote>Your cards are lovely. I rang up Miss Harland and have been
over to sit with her father and do what I can for him so that she can
get out to do her shopping. He's getting on well but is pretty
helpless still with his broken arm. No other news except that Elaine
is engaged and going to marry a foreigner ...</quote>
   <p>Gay read the rest of the letter then put it back in her bag.
Elaine was engaged, to the man she had spent so much time with at her
party. That was why Gavin had come back to her. Everything was quite
clear now, and to her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak, rather a
sense of relief now that she knew why Gavin had come to see her.
Because she was second best.
   <p>The others came back to the table, all of them making a fuss of
her and at once she felt happier. Gay loved them for their warm
sympathy, knowing that they were real friends, even if they were new
ones.
   <p><quote>That is a pretty dress,</quote> Lilyan commented, obviously sensing
Gay's distress and in a way that Doc, as a man, could not understand,
knowing that Gay was as much ashamed for Gavin at the way he was
behaving as she was hurt for herself.
   <p><quote>I made it myself,</quote> Gay tried to speak normally.

<head>CHAPTER ONE</head>
   <p>THE hospital was literally sited at the cross-roads, though set
back from the street by a drive of about a hundred and fifty yards and
cushioned by rounded shrubs and a belt of trees which helped to absorb
the noise of the traffic.
   <p>There was a large new roundabout and a sign which gave the
distances to both Edinburgh and London, Great Yarmouth and Liverpool,
for besides being at the cross-roads, St. John's was also sited
roughly at the heart of England, the highways resembling vast arteries
pouring the flood tide of commerce and private pleasure in four
entirely different directions.
   <p>Diana Wills often sat on the brand new seat outside the hospital
gates and thought vagrant thoughts. At one time she had watched the
workmen constructing the roundabout, which was to put St. John's
Casualty Department out of operation &mdash; in theory, at least. She would
think of herself as a stranger in these parts studying these
cross-roads.
   <p>Which one to take?
   <p><quote>If I were a tramp I would simply blow a feather,</quote> she
decided, rather envying the gentleman of the road his freedom of
decision, and wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded women
doctors to blow a feather and follow its airy directions accordingly.
   <p><quote>If I were needing a job I'd go to London, of course,</quote> she
went on. <quote>There are all sorts of wonderful jobs in London and I
could take my pick, whereas in Yarmouth one has to know something
about fishing and in Liverpool they'd want sea-farers. I don't think
I'd go to Edinburgh unless I was a Scot and wanting to get home, or
perhaps a student studying to be a doctor, and I already know all
about that.</quote>
   <p>Being at a cross-roads was unsettling, she also decided. One
felt as though one hadn't arrived anywhere. True, St. John's was on
the outskirts of Farlingham, a small, prosperous North Midlands town,
but apart from the inhabitants everybody else regarded Farlingham as a
spot where one could fill up the car, have a cup of tea and go on to
somewhere else with vastly more to offer in the way of opportunity and
entertainment.
   <p>It was getting too cool for sitting on the seat by early October,
Di decided, as she collected her various items of shopping &mdash; she never
carried a basket &mdash; and prepared to go inside for tea. She felt
chilled to the bone and somewhat depressed. Normally she looked
forward to her days off, an expedition into town, a visit either to
her hairdresser or the cinema and Nigel dashing out to join her for
either luncheon or tea in his screaming red M.G.
   <p>She was engaged to Nigel, had been for two years. Sometimes they
talked on the theme of <quote>when we get married</quote>, and then all was
wonderful, and perhaps it had only been a slip of the tongue when
Nigel had said, only last evening, <quote>If we get married, old girl,
you'll have to stop that lark, I can tell you!</quote>
   <p>She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or which
<squote>lark</squote> she would have to stop, only that significant tiny word
shouted into her very soul a horn of warning, and with it was coupled
a disembodied fragment of information, which now took on an ominous
significance: Nigel had been seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had
sworn he had been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
Little Phelpham.
   <p>Now Nigel had every right to go where he liked during his
off-duty periods when she was not free; this much they had conceded
one to the other. They rarely found they were off duty together, and
the situation would have been intolerable had there not been some give
and take about their relationship.
   <p>So when Nigel had told her about taking Luke's evening surgery
she had said, <quote>Bless you! I hope Luke is suitably grateful,
darling.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, well,</quote> he shrugged diffidently, <quote>I like the work. One
gets plenty of variety and it's a change.</quote>
   <p>Nigel was the hospital's Junior Medical Officer.
   <p><quote>You won't be free about nine, I suppose, to meet me for supper
somewhere?</quote> she had asked hopefully.
   <p><quote>Hardly likely, my sweet. Luke's surgery goes on for hours. If
they get in before eight-thirty, even though they're standing on one
another's toes, I've got to see 'em. If I am free, though, I'll
give you a ring, O.K.?</quote>
   <p>O.K.,</quote> she had replied readily.
   <p>So how could Nigel have been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse,
dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that very evening?
   <p><quote>No,</quote> she told Phil Gubbins, a junior houseman, <quote>it wasn't
Nigel you saw, my lad.</quote>
   <p><quote>It was Nigel's car, anyway. NUF 121.</quote>
   <p><quote>He probably loaned his car to somebody, Phil. He's always
doing that.</quote>
   <p>Young Gubbins shrugged.
   <p><quote>I didn't see his face, Di, but it certainly looked like Nigel
from the back. D.j. and all. Of course such as I couldn't afford
to go into the Load of Trouble.</quote>
   <p><quote>Neither can Nigel,</quote> smiled Diana. <quote>He's saving up to get
married. Remember?</quote>
   <p><quote>I remember,</quote> quipped the houseman, meaning no offence, <quote>but
does he? That blonde was something.</quote>
   <p><quote>Anybody I know?</quote> she smiled.
   <p><quote>I think so. I got a good look at her. But if Nigel wasn't
there it isn't important, is it?</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> Di said immediately. <quote>It isn't at all important.</quote>
   <p>But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had
realised it was important enough for her to have remembered, and it
was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and made her
think there was an abyss immediately ahead.
   <p><quote>Nigel,</quote> she had besought him, <quote>you know that evening you
took Luke Parson's  surgery and there was a woman with a cyst
on her ear ... ?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ye-es?</quote> he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the mouth,
an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge. <quote>What about it, my
sweet?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well,</quote> she laughed suddenly in an upsurging of relief, <quote>that
stupid Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble. With a
blonde, too. Imagine!</quote>
   <p>Nigel was frowning. He looked distinguished when he frowned;
boyishly handsome at other times.
   <p><quote>Gubbins? Gubbins?</quote> he fretted. <quote>Who's he?</quote>
   <p>Though Diana knew the name of every member of the staff,
distinguished or not, Nigel often had to think hard to sort them out.
   <p><quote>He's the carrotty  lad, isn't he?</quote> he now demanded.
   <p><quote>What was he doing at the Load of Trouble?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, he wasn't. His motor-bike had broken down outside and he
noticed your car and then you dancing with this blonde.</quote>
   <p><quote>Really?</quote> Nigel cocked one eyebrow. <quote>Actually she was
brunette at the roots and I had a redhead on the other arm. He would
have told you this, too?</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> she laughed. <quote>He didn't actually see you. Because
it was your car I suppose he presumed it was you, all dressed up in
your dinner suit.</quote>
   <p><quote>My white or my black?</quote> Nigel enquired. <quote>Now I wonder which
I wore at that particular surgery?</quote>
   <p><quote>You are a fool, darling,</quote> Di said happily. <quote>I shall
take great pleasure in telling that young man exactly what you were
doing that evening.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, don't,</quote> he said, after kissing her again. <quote>I rather
like to have the housemen think of me as a two-timing Don Juan. I'm
such a dull fellow, really.</quote>
   <p><quote>Dull?</quote> She couldn't believe it. Self-deprecation was not
one of Nigel's usual attributes. <quote>You need your holiday,
darling. I only wish I could go with you!</quote>
   <p><quote>Doctor Wills, if you're making improper suggestions ...?</quote>
   <p><quote>It would make me more interesting, I suppose?</quote> she enquired
archly.
   <p><quote>No, it wouldn't!</quote> he almost snapped, surprising her.
   <p><quote>You sounded like somebody else for a moment there. It doesn't
become you to behave like a &mdash; a tart, Di.</quote>
   <p><quote>Nigel &mdash; !</quote> she gasped. <quote>I didn't mean to behave like
anything of the kind. I was only joking.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, don't. It's miserable enough my having to take my leave
in the autumn without you trying to be bright and gay about it. I'm
going with a shooting party. What else can I do at this time of year?
I can't ask you up because it's a strictly stag affair.</quote>
   <p><quote>I know. I didn't expect ...</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, don't keep hinting, then. You wish you could come with
me; you hope I'll miss you; you can't imagine the hospital without me
for three weeks, etcetera, etcetera!</quote>
   <p>Diana's face was drained of colour. She was almost angry for a
moment.
   <p><quote>Am I expected not to mind your going away for three weeks?</quote>
she asked simply.
   <p>He looked at her, noting, as for the first time, the pansy blue
of the eyes that were his fianc&eacute;e's best feature. Her hair was of
a chestnut brown shade, which glinted with gold in the evenings, he
had noticed. Her figure was small and exquisite, like a schoolgirl's
still, and he admired her legs, which the male sex were inclined to
regard first.
   <p><quote>I would mind if you didn't</quote> he told her grimly, and
tugged her fiercely into his arms. <quote>You're right, pet. I do
need this leave. I'm bad-tempered and broody and going out with
brash blondes. I don't deserve you.</quote>
   <p><quote>Darling!</quote> her voiced caressed him. <quote>Moments like this make
all the waiting worth while. When we're married we won't have these
explosions of emotion, will we?</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he eyed her strangely. <quote>I wish we were married, Di.
Like a patient wishes his operation was over.</quote>
   <p>Again her laughter trilled.
   <p><quote>Marriage isn't as bad as an operation, Nigel!</quote>
   <p><quote>Isn't it?</quote> he rose and smoothed himself down. <quote>Ask any
bridegroom-to-be. Anyhow, that particular problem isn't looming
at the moment, thank God!</quote>
   <p>Problem ... ? looming ... ?
   <p><quote>Are we discussing a marriage or a burial?</quote> she asked, hardly
believing he could be serious. <quote>Surely marrying me isn't going to be
all that bad? If it is &mdash;</quote> she laughed uncertainly &mdash; <quote>you can have
your ring back.</quote>
   <p>She loosened the half-hoop of diamonds on her left hand third
finger and held it out to him, still playfully. Without a glimmer of
amusement in his own eyes, however, he took it, looking moodily beyond
her.
   <p><quote>Perhaps it's as well if you don't wear it for a bit, Di,</quote> he
told her.
   <p><quote>But I want it!</quote> she protested. <quote>It's my ring.</quote>
   <p><quote>You just gave it back to me.</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't! I was joking. You know I was joking, Nigel.</quote>
   <p><quote>You shouldn't joke about serious things like engagements.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't be such a baby!</quote>
   <p>They were going to have an open quarrel any minute, and she knew
it. Almost in desperation she appealed, <quote>Will you meet me at the
gate, four o'clock tomorrow?</quote>
   <p><quote>Why?</quote> he enquired, combing his thick, tawny hair.
   <p><quote>To bring me up for tea, of course. I just thought.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll see,</quote> he told her, and suddenly seized her in an embrace
which really hurt. <quote>Without your ring it's just like kissing
somebody else's girl,</quote> he decided wickedly, and kissed her again,
somewhat startled to receive a sharp slap for his pains.
   <p><quote>If I were somebody else's girl that's what you'd get,</quote> she
flashed at him, and so had left him, on her dignity and not seeing the
look of admiration and revelation which had followed her slim young
figure out of his sight.
   <p><quote>Mine,</quote> Nigel Lester had decided with a sigh of satisfaction,
and then regarded the ring which he retrieved from his pocket. <quote>At a
price,</quote> he concluded, with some bitterness.
   <p>
   <p>Thus had they parted the previous evening and now Diana was
trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital alone. Of course one
couldn't say for certain when a doctor would be free during the day;
tea was served from four until five-thirty in the residents'
common-room, which proved the elasticity of medical commitments.
Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention, she was
convinced, or he would have granted her small request to be met at the
gates. They often had such a rendezvous, for there was just time to
smoke a cigarette, if one walked slowly, between road and hospital.

<text id=LOBP04>
   <p>Carol waited until after the child had gone, then she sprang
out of bed and started quickly to dress. She would waken Jacques and
get him to drive her into Nice to Jimmy's hotel and together they
would go to the police with the diamond and emerald clip.
   <p>She didn't want to bring Ray into this. He had sentimental
loyalties towards Grant. He might still give him the chance to
escape, and if Grant did escape all hope of proving Ray's innocence
would be gone. But she knew she had to act &mdash; and to act quickly. She
had already aroused Grant's suspicions by her questions.
   <p>She went quietly down the staircase. There was only a short
distance through the foyer before she reached the front door. But
when she tried to close it after her a foot was forced in the open
doorway. Her shoulder was seized, and before she could scream a pad
was thrust into her mouth. She felt something shoved into her ribs,
and turning slightly sideways she saw it was the nozzle of a revolver.
   <p><quote>Keep going,</quote> Grant said in a low harsh voice. <quote>One false
movement and you're as good as dead. Don't kid yourself I'll be timid
about using this revolver; it's my life or yours.</quote>
   <p>She couldn't scream because of the gag in her mouth and he held
both her hands tightly behind her back. He made her walk round to the
garage and once there he bound both her arms and her legs tightly.
Then he bundled her into the back of his car, laying her on the
floor.
   <p>It had all happened so quickly she felt completely numb. And
anyhow she had had no chance; he had taken her completely unawares.
She hadn't even time to think where he might be taking her or what he
intended to do with her. He threw a rug over her and shortly
afterwards she heard him start up the car.
   <p>Jacques slept above the garage, but he was used to Grant taking
his car out at night. Ray and Sarah were also accustomed to it. Even
if they were still awake they would suspect nothing. It was no
consolation to know that Jimmy and she had been right, that Grant
obviously had not only been the notorious jewel thief but had also
murdered Greta. It seemed reasonable to suppose he had murdered her
because she had come upon him in the act of stealing her jewellery.
For once his timing had been wrong. He wouldn't have made the
attempt if he hadn't thought she would be out and he had undoubtedly
known that the few servants, who slept in another wing, were asleep
and would hear nothing. Probably he had had inside knowledge from one
of them. It had obviously been the same with the other robberies he
had pulled off.
   <p>But the knowledge that she and Jimmy had been right didn't help
her now. She didn't think that Grant would show her any more mercy
than he had shown Greta. She blinked up at the stars and occasionally
she saw lights and heard traffic as though they were passing through
villages or towns.
   <p>But presently they began to climb up a twisting road. They
climbed higher and higher. The thought flashed through her mind, this
is the Grande Corniche, the scenic highway road which links Nice and
Monte Carlo. Very few people drove the Grande Corniche at night; they
either drove round the Moyenne Corniche or the road that skirted the
Mediterranean.
   <p>Her heart sank. What hope would she have of rescue in this
desolate region? Jimmy had warned her that questioning Grant might be
dangerous. But what had finally prompted him to abduct her in this
way with the obvious purpose of killing her? Did he know that she had
Greta's clip? He might easily have been listening outside the door.
But if he had been, Sarah was equally in danger; it was she who had
found the clip in his car.
   <p>She felt icy cold and completely desperate. He would have no
hesitation about getting rid of the child as well as her in case she
babbled something about the clip. Or would he be afraid to kill
Sarah? He had done his best to put the blame for Greta's death on
Ray; but surely the police would never suspect that Ray had murdered
his own daughter? The thought gave her hope, though her own
predicament was still as desperate.
   <p>Grant was driving the car carefully. Obviously he didn't wish to
be stopped for speeding. But finally after a terrific climb he drew
the car to a standstill.
   <p>Carol had managed to twist the rug off her head. She saw that it
was a beautiful Mediterranean night with a full moon, a blue-black
sky, and the stars were shining brightly. What a night on which to
die, she thought, trying to feel amused. But it was impossible to
feel amused for the cord with which he had bound her cut into her
wrists and ankles; the gag hurt her mouth. How would he kill her? A
shot would be the most merciful end and she knew he had a revolver
with him.
   <p>He came round and opened the back door of the car. <quote>Had a nice
ride?</quote> he asked in a hoarse, cynical voice.
   <p>He removed the gag and untied her legs. The sudden sensation of
freedom from her cramped position was almost exhilarating.
   <p><quote>Few people pass here at night,</quote> he said, <quote>and I still have
my gun. So you won't dare scream. I heard you and Sarah talking so I
crept to your door and listened. I've been worried about that damned
clip ever since I lost it. You're not a fool. I know you've put two
and two together ever since the child told you about the clip. But
you suspected me before that, didn't you? I knew by those questions
you asked me the other night.</quote>
   <p>She raised herself to a sitting position. <quote>Yes, I suspected
you, but Jimmy Mattson also suspects you. He contacted the firm of
Brevet &amp; Ren&eacute; in Marseilles. You haven't been trying to buy the
lease of any luxury hotel. We also know there's no Hotel Imperial in
Marseilles where you could have stayed that night. If you kill me, as
far as Jimmy is concerned it will be a definite proof of your
guilt.</quote>
   <p>He asked almost wildly, <quote>But how can I let you live, knowing
that you know the truth? You might propose a bargain &mdash; your life for
your silence. But how could I ever trust you?</quote>
   <p><quote>What are you going to do about Sarah?</quote> she asked. And
despite her own danger that was the thought uppermost in her mind.
   <p><quote>An accident,</quote> he said. <quote>Probably while she is swimming with
the dog.</quote>
   <p>Carol shuddered, remembering the dream Sarah had had. All the
same her voice was very calm as she asked, <quote>What are you going to do
with me?</quote>
   <p><quote>You're going over the edge,</quote> he said. <quote>This is the highest
point on the Grande Corniche. It's doubtful if they'll find your body
for many days &mdash; even weeks. And in the meanwhile I'll be clear of the
country. Your friend Jimmy Mattson may have his suspicions, but he
won't have any proof. Ray won't have any proof either. Besides, Ray
doesn't suspect me of having had any connection with the recent jewel
robberies or with Greta's death. He doesn't know that I have been
bribing the household staffs of his friends for information about
their employers' habits and where they kept their jewellery, or that I
was responsible for those friends who called upon the Baroness
Beaufort the night her jewellery was stolen; their presence gave me
the chance to do what I wanted to do.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why did you kill the Countess Doriana?</quote> Carol asked.
   <p><quote>She came home early from the party and found me at the job. I
had to strangle her to silence her. I don't feel any sense of guilt.
She had always been a no-good woman. I'm sorry about you, Carol;
you're not a bad sort. It's a pity you took it upon yourself to
interfere with my affairs.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why wouldn't I?</quote> she threw back at him. <quote>You left Ray's
cigarette lighter beside his dead wife's body; you did your best to
implicate him.</quote>
   <p><quote>I happened to have the lighter in my pocket. I borrowed it
ages ago when my own lighter ran out of fuel. I had to protect
myself, and Ray was the obvious suspect. I'm going to give you a
drink and then I'll take that clip from your handbag. There'll be
something pretty potent in that drink; you won't feel any shock or
pain. You'll be unconscious by the time you go over.</quote>
   <p>He took a flask from his pocket and got a glass out of the glove
compartment of the car.
   <p>She set her lips firmly. <quote>I won't drink it.</quote>
   <p>He shrugged. <quote>Please yourself. But you're a fool if you don't.
The sensation of falling from a great height can't be over
pleasant.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'd rather risk it,</quote> she said. <quote>You'll have to shoot me
before I'll jump. And when my body is found the bullet will be traced
back to your gun.</quote>
   <p>He gave a low laugh. <quote>It happens to be Ray's gun. I took it
from his bedside table while he was sleeping. The police will
undoubtedly think that you stumbled upon some fresh evidence which
made it certain that Ray had murdered his ex-wife. The only thing he
could do was to get rid of you. I'll unbind your arms and then you
drink this down. That's the last thing you will remember.</quote>
   <p>He unbound her arms and then he tried to force the glass between
her lips.
   <p><quote>No,</quote> she shrieked and pushed the glass away from her.
   <p>He hit her hard across the face, but in her present state of
nervous tension she scarcely felt it.
   <p><quote>If you won't drink it, I don't care,</quote> he said presently.
<quote>You're going over the edge anyhow.</quote>
   <p>She screamed again as he dragged her from the back of the car.
Her legs collapsed under her. She fell sprawling at his feet. And
then suddenly it happened. A shot rang out. He lurched and gave a
cry and dropped beside her.
   <p>It could not have been more than a few minutes later that she
felt a man's arms about her; arms which were familiar and very dear to
her. She opened her eyes and in the white moonlight she saw Ray's
face bending over her.
   <p><quote>Darling, darling Carol,</quote> he cried. <quote>Are you all right?</quote>
   <p><quote>Ray,</quote> she whispered.
   <p>She must have passed out for the next thing she knew he was
shaking her.
   <p><quote>My darling! My darling! Say something to me.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm all right, Ray,</quote> she murmured. <quote>How did you find where
he had taken me?</quote>
   <p><quote>Sarah hadn't gone to sleep. She saw him grasp hold of you and
gag you and take you out of the house. She rushed in and told me. I
jumped out of bed and was dressed in a jiffy. While I dressed she
told me about finding her mother's clip in Grant's car. I wasn't so
long after you. During a hold-up in the Nice traffic I was able to
pick up his car. But when he started up the Grande Corniche I lost
him temporarily. I was too intent on catching up with him to be aware
that another car was following me. I had him in sight until he
disappeared down the side road. I turned off the engine of the car
and listened, and then the other car drew alongside me. It was a
police car. They had been detailed to watch the villa and follow me
if I tried to escape. Thank heavens they did follow me and that you
screamed. I had no gun and Grant was armed. I shouldn't have had a
chance if they hadn't seen what was happening and shot him down.

But I should be back in an hour or so.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, at the hospital, I suppose!</quote> Lorraine did not wait for
her mother to confirm or deny this, but turned back to Noreen.
   <p>With a smile and a sigh &mdash; for it was obvious that the twins were
too taken up with their own affairs to enquire or sympathize &mdash; she
went out.
   <p><quote>Mr. Delorme was thrilled!</quote> Joanna went on breathlessly.
<quote>He's suggested we should go to town as soon as it can be arranged,
and, when we're settled, he's going to put us on at the Lys \d'Or,
which is a very exclusive night club.</quote>
   <p>Noreen looked doubtful. <quote>But is that what you wanted? I
thought you hoped to get on the stage or television? A night club
sounds rather a come-down. I don't want to sound discouraging, but
aren't some of them pretty low dives?</quote>
   <p>Lorraine, who had been lounging on the cushioned window-seat,
straightened up and leant forward eagerly.
   <p><quote>Don't be so nai"ve and stupid, Norrie! There are night clubs
and night clubs, as you'd know, if you weren't such an ignoramus!
This is one of the top places, frightfully swell. We'll get a
wonderful salary if we deliver the goods, and get to know a lot of
useful people.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oliver knows Mr. Delorme quite well,</quote> Joanna put in, not
noticing how Noreen's eyebrows went up at her unthinking use of his
first name. <quote>And if he backs anybody, that's surely good
enough!</quote>
   <p>There was such warmth of partisanship in her tone that Noreen was
astonished. She said impulsively: <quote>But you hardly know him, Jo!
Mr. Randall, I mean. How can you be so sure that he's on the
level?</quote>
   <p>Joanna stubbed out her cigarette with unnecessary fierceness.
Her lovely eyes were defiant above cheeks whose colour had deepened
at Noreen's remark.
   <p><quote>There are some people you don't have to know for years before
you can trust them. And Oliver Randall's one of them. He's
absolutely wonderful! He's promised to find us a flat &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Over Joanna's coppery head, Lorraine's eyes met Noreen's
enquiring gaze. She laughed mischievously, and without envy.
   <p><quote>As you may have gathered, Norrie, Jo's fallen for the man,
hook, line and sinker! And I'd say he'd be equally enthusiastic, if
it wasn't for his wife's restraining influence. I've warned Jo
already that she must walk warily when that lady's around.</quote>
   <p>Joanna sprang suddenly to her feet. <quote>Don't talk rubbish,
Lorraine! I do like Oliver, and he's been perfectly sweet to us
both &mdash; you must admit that! Not only to me, as you seem to imply.
There's no need to put ridiculous ideas into Norrie's head. By the
way!</quote> She turned to Noreen. <quote>I suppose you realize that we want
you to come with us when we go back to town? We explained to Mr.
Delorme that we must have you as our accompanist.</quote>
   <p><quote>Me?</quote> Noreen was taken aback. Somehow, she had quite
overlooked this possibility, and though, at one time, she had been
hurt by her sisters' apparent disregard of her, she was now aware that
the prospect of leaving Dorlcombe was oddly unwelcome. <quote>Mummy won't
like it if we all go off and leave her.</quote>
   <p>Joanna shrugged impatiently. <quote>If you prefer to stick here in
this dreary place &mdash; and you know just how dull and forsaken it is
after the season's over &mdash; that's your look-out. But I must say I
think it's rather mean of you, especially after we insisted to Mr.
Delorme that we must have you, as well. Let me talk to Mummy! I
don't suppose she'll raise any objection.</quote>
   <p>Noreen said no more. She felt that the twins would not
understand if she attempted to make them see her point of view. Their
trip to town, she thought, seemed to have changed them in some
inexplicable way. She knew that they had always been ambitious, eager
to try their wings in a wider sphere, but, now the chance had come,
they seemed to be thinking of nothing and no one save themselves. Yet
their mother, as Noreen knew, had done everything in her power to make
them happy. Surely she would feel very lost and lonely if all her
children deserted her?
   <p>When Mrs. Sangster returned, they could hear her talking to
someone as she came up the stairs. Joanna and Lorraine looked at each
other in bewilderment, but Noreen, recognizing Stephen's quiet,
pleasant voice, went out to meet them. She guessed, even before she
saw the eager look on his face, that he had come with the express
purpose of seeing Joanna, and her heart sank at the thought of his
probable reception.
   <p><quote>Mr. Redfern very kindly brought me home in his car,</quote> Mrs.
Sangster explained as they came into the room. Lorraine greeted him
pleasantly enough, but Joanna's greeting was barely polite. After a
few moments of general conversation, Mrs. Sangster said: <quote>Well,
I'm going to see about some supper. You'll stay and have some with
us, won't you, Mr. Redfern? Lorraine dear, do come down with me and
tell me all your news. I'm longing to hear how you got on in town.
And, Noreen, did you remember to feed the chickens?</quote>
   <p>The two girls followed their mother downstairs, Noreen carefully
shutting the door behind them, and deliberately ignoring Joanna's
murmur of protest.
   <p>After they had gone, there was an awkward little silence, then
Stephen said gently: <quote>I hope everything went as well as you
expected, Jo?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh yes! Better, really. We shall be going to London at the
end of this month.</quote> She jumped up and began straightening some
magazines on the table. <quote>We've been offered a very good engagement,
you see.</quote>
   <p>He rose and came over, standing just behind her. A tiny shiver
went down Joanna's spine, but he did not touch her.
   <p><quote>Well, that's grand! Just what you hoped for, isn't it? As a
matter of fact, I've got some news for you, too. Though I'm afraid it
won't seem very exciting to you &mdash; now.</quote>
   <p>She swung round to face him, arms folded, clear eyes wide. She
had changed from the suit she had worn for the journey, and was now
wearing her favourite attire &mdash; a thin, woollen jersey and slacks. His
hands clenched involuntarily as he looked at her &mdash; so lovely with that
glow of colour in her cheeks, her hair a bright halo about her
upthrown head.
   <p><quote>Why not, Steve? Always glad to hear of a friend's good
fortune!</quote> Her tone was deliberately casual and gay, and nothing in
her manner betrayed the way in which her heart was racing.
   <p><quote>Have you gone and got yourself engaged or something?</quote>
   <p>He faced her steadily, no answering gaiety in his eyes.
   <p><quote>You can't really think that, Jo. When you know there's only
one girl I'd ever want to be engaged to. No, I've come into some
money &mdash; not a vast fortune, by any means, but enough to make me feel,
at least, that I have something to offer you.</quote>
   <p><quote>But I &mdash;</quote> Joanna began. She stepped quickly aside, and would
have moved away from him, but he laid a restraining hand on her arm.
Gentle though it was, there was the suggestion of power behind that
touch, and involuntarily she stood still.
   <p><quote>I've never told you in so many words,</quote> he went on, his voice
as quiet and controlled as ever, <quote>but you must have guessed that I
care for you &mdash; very deeply. I've loved you ever since you were a
schoolgirl, Jo, but I didn't think I stood a chance compared with all
your other admirers. You wanted gaiety and fun; I was hard up and had
to put my studies first. My parents sacrificed a lot to pay for my
training, and it wouldn't have been right to let them down. But now
I'm really established, and with this unexpected legacy coming
along &mdash;</quote>
   <p>With an impatient movement, she pulled free from him and turned
quickly away towards the window, speaking with her back to him.
   <p><quote>Don't go on, Steve! Oh, don't think I don't like you, and I
suppose I should say thank you for &mdash; for wanting to marry me. But
it's quite impossible &mdash; it always will be impossible! Don't you
understand, the sort of life you're offering me &mdash; just living in
Quaystone and keeping house and all that &mdash; it's so deadly dull! I
want something different &mdash; all the things that I've now got the chance
of enjoying. Even if I loved you, I'm afraid I wouldn't say yes!</quote>
   <p>There was silence. Wondering, expecting a protest, she half
turned and looked at him. He was standing motionless, a queer
suggestion of defeat, of hopelessness, about the powerful shoulders,
the bent head where the fair hair was so smoothly brushed, save for
the unruly drake's-tail on the crown. Joanna's eyes suddenly
softened, and a reluctant feeling of compassion swept over her. But,
before she could speak, he had recovered his normal self-control.
   <p><quote>If you loved me, as you say, &mdash; well, it might not seem so
<squote>deadly dull.</squote> But you don't, and that's that!</quote> He smiled, and
held out his hand. <quote>Let's part good friends, Jo dear. If you're
going to get your heart's desire, that's all that really matters to
me. Will you apologize to your mother for me, and tell her I'm sorry
I can't stay to supper, after all?</quote>
   <p>As the outer door shut behind him, Noreen put her head round the
kitchen door and said doubtfully:
   <p><quote>Did I hear somebody?</quote>
   <p><quote>Steve's gone. He couldn't stay, after all,</quote> Joanna said.
She went quickly along the landing to her room and shut the door
behind her. There she sat down on the edge of the bed, dabbing at her
wet eyes, and telling herself not to be such a sentimental idiot.
   <p>Silly to be shedding tears because you had turned down a man who
didn't really matter a button to you. Oh, he's nice enough! Joanna
admitted. But there's nothing thrilling about poor old Steve.
Nothing to make one's nerves tingle and one's heart race &mdash; as it had
done only this morning. A dreamy smile spread over her face as her
mind went back to those heavenly moments. Leaving Lorraine to finish
their packing, she had gone out to buy some cigarettes, and, just
outside the hotel, had almost run into Oliver.
   <p><quote>I wanted to come and see you off,</quote> he had told her, with that
softening of his expression which always made her feel oddly
breathless. <quote>But my wife reminded me that I have an appointment at
just about the time your train leaves, so I decided to nip along in
the hope of seeing you before you left the hotel. It's going to seem
a long time until the end of this month, Jo my dear, but when you come
back ...</quote> his hand had closed over hers warmly <quote>... we'll make up
for all the empty days. Will they seem empty to you too, do you
think?</quote>
   <p>She had nodded, unable to find words that would tell him her
feelings.
   <p><quote>Well, it must be Au revoir, then.</quote> He had put his
hands on her shoulders and smiled down into her eyes. <quote>Wish this
wasn't such a damned public place, or I'd say good-bye to you
properly &mdash; you sweet thing!</quote> His voice fell to so soft a tone that
she barely caught the last three words. And with that, before she
could take a breath, he was gone, leaving her caught up to a pitch of
excitement and ecstasy that was yet perilously near to tears.
   <p>All the way home that parting speech had sung itself, over and
over, in her mind. <quote>You sweet thing.</quote> Did that mean &mdash; no, it
couldn't mean that Oliver was in love with her? But she reminded
herself, he doesn't say things like that to Lorraine! He must
like me better! And then, following hard on that delicious
knowledge would come the inevitable thought, But he's married! It
can't mean anything &mdash; except that he's taken a fancy to me.

<text id=LOBP06>
<QUOTE>
Why you took the case, when you never touch anything of the
sort.</squote>
   <p>For a second his grim, menacing anger frightened her as he half
shouted: <squote>Are you trying to suggest that I was her lover?
Responsible for &mdash;</squote> He stopped. Conflict tortured him. Here was
his supreme revenge: to tell her the truth; shatter her faith in
Philip... Beryl was dead... He shivered. Taking with her the only
proof he had to discount this accusation.
   <p>Sandra prayed, despite her vituperation, that he would have
some defence, give her some denial, but all he said was: <squote>If you
believe me capable of that, we have nothing more to say to each
other &mdash; nothing.</squote>
   <p>The hurt in him was like a wound &mdash; stinging, aching. Was this
Philip's work? And even if it were, it came back to one man's word
against another and... she loved Philip. Until then the exactitudes
of his profession had demanded his silence, and now he was absolved
from that promise, he found himself bound by his own love for her, his
desire for her happiness. Far better that she should believe him
to be a cad than the man she was going to marry and obviously loved
so deeply. He doubted that Philip would betray her after all that had
happened. Fear would be a deterrent.
   <p>Sandra flung her arms out in a gesture of despair. <squote>Do you
leave me anything else to believe? Or is your silence the
cowardly way out?</squote> She hated the words, but they leapt from the
torment of loving him; from the tension, the weariness that made even
breathing an effort.
   <p><squote>Is this what has been in your mind all the time?</squote> He spoke
with greater passion. <squote>Was this why you wanted to leave the job just
before Philip was taken ill?</squote> His mouth hardened, his eyes became
steely. <squote>I see.</squote> Scorn lashed his words. <squote>I wonder you dared
trust him to my care.</squote>
   <p><squote>Nicholas &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Well! At least I know the truth. Truth!</squote> His gaze held
hers masterfully. <squote>You wanted it so badly &mdash; at any price. I hope
you are satisfied.</squote> And as he spoke, the thought of Philip lying in
the other room filled him with a revulsion that was homicidal. Even
in that, his hands were tied. He dare not precipitate what might well
be another coronary. And in that second he put back his professional
mantle, and said with such icy politeness, such withdrawn bitterness,
that Sandra withered before it: <squote>I will leave you the necessary
prescription for the sedatives. You will contact your new doctor when
you reach your parents' house.</squote> She watched him flick his
fountain-pen from his waistcoat pocket, take out his prescription pad,
and scribble on it. Then, with a gesture she knew so well, he tore
off the leaflet and handed it to her. <squote>Good-bye, Sandra,</squote> he said
with a deadly finality. Watching him go, unable to speak, she felt
that part of her was leaving with him. She couldn't hate him... If
only he would have confided in her, given some explanation. Now there
was nothing &mdash; not even friendship.
   <p>She went back to Philip. But all she could hear were Nicholas's
words: <squote>I love you &mdash; oh, you know that well enough.</squote> Love.
She revolted against the word. Nicholas, Philip... where was
happiness, or peace of mind?
   <p>Philip put out a hand and grasped hers. He needed her. She
would find solace in that fact at least. And she hadn't to doubt his
sincerity any more... She had her truth. How much had built up
from that first ideal, and how little joy, or satisfaction, it had
given her. <squote>I'm sorry, darling.</squote> He looked nervous. It had been
hell lying there, knowing she was talking to Nicholas and wondering
what they were saying.
   <p>Sandra said instinctively: <squote>I told him I knew he was
responsible for Beryl's death.</squote> She rushed on: <squote>His attitude...
I don't know &mdash; something snapped. I couldn't stand it... Why do you
look at me like that?</squote>
   <p><squote>I asked you not to mention it.</squote> Philip felt that he was
running a high temperature as fear swirled back. What had Nicholas
said?
   <p><squote>I would never have done so while Beryl was alive. He hadn't
any answer &mdash; except to suggest that if I believed him capable of
that &mdash;</squote> Her eyes darkened in torment. <squote>Are you sure that
she was telling the truth?</squote>
   <p><squote>Good heavens, darling, why on earth should she lie? Besides,
it wasn't just her word. There was enough evidence, no matter how one
might want to disbelieve the facts.</squote> Elation touched him after the
cold wind of suspense. <squote>It will be interesting to see what comes out
at the inquest. What his story will be. I reckon he'll confine
himself to the nervous origin of her recent illness. His notes will
be truthful, but what he leaves out will matter most.</squote> Strange how
just then Philip was so certain that Nicholas would never betray
him. He loved Sandra too deeply to ruin her future happiness.
Had ever circumstances conspired so cunningly? Philip's spirits
soared. He was better; he had made a miraculous recovery and Sandra
would soon be his wife. The Devil, he thought, certainly looked after
his own. Something in Sandra's attitude struck him suddenly, making
him say: <squote>You can't forgive him for this &mdash; can you?</squote>
   <p><squote>Forgive is an unctuous, patronizing word,</squote> she replied. <squote>I
despise the deceit. The lies.</squote>
   <p>Philip couldn't keep the words back. <squote>Suppose you had loved him
and all this came out. What then?</squote>
   <p>Suppose you had loved him...
   <p>Sandra realized with a bitter futility that now it was her
silence that was the lie. And Nicholas's words re-echoed mockingly:
<squote>No human being could live with absolute truth.</squote>
   <p><squote>I couldn't live without faith, Philip. Or with pretence.</squote>
She shivered. She was going to pretend for the rest of her life.
Pretend to be in love with Philip even though she knew she would try
never to utter those words. How honourable was that? She looked at
him, and his need of her, his dependence upon her, created a climate
where self-delusion masqueraded as the right thing to do. How easy it
would have been to cling to Nicholas, tell him that she could hardly
bear life without him, no matter what he had done to make her despise
him... But to walk out on Philip, break her promise and end their
relationship, for no better reason than what appeared as innate
self-preservation. That was impossible. He had been honest with her
and didn't deserve to be let down. She said suddenly, irrelevantly:
<squote>Beryl's life recently &mdash; the whole thing &mdash; was very strange when you
think of it.</squote>
   <p><squote>How?</squote> Philip looked startled.
   <p><squote>Would she have married Nicholas in any case, since she loved
you?</squote>
   <p>Philip felt a stab of jealousy. <squote>Are you trying to make his
case good?</squote>
   <p><squote>No; to be fair. He seemed so amazed when I suggested marriage
to her. I've only thought of your illness lately &mdash; never studied all
this beyond the angle of Beryl's unhappiness and Nicholas being
involved. I didn't tell you, but she called here two days ago.</squote>
   <p><squote>What?</squote> Philip felt that he had been swirled down a bumpy
lift. <squote>But &mdash; why?</squote> He hastened. <squote>Why should she call?</squote>
   <p><squote>Oh, just to thank me and to inquire about you. Looking back,
her attitude was strange. She seemed afraid &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>Of Nicholas,</squote> Philip said insinuatingly.
   <p>Sandra couldn't deny that, and the more she dwelt on it all, the
more curious it became. <squote>She spoke about wondering if she ought to
tell me &mdash;</squote> Sandra began to shiver.
   <p>Philip managed to keep his voice steady. <squote>I can imagine
Nicholas putting the fear of God into her. The last person he would
want told was you.</squote>
   <p>It added up, and Sandra nodded. <squote>But it is still like looking
at a picture in shadow.</squote>
   <p><squote>I told you that &mdash; soon after the cottage episode. What was she
keeping back... We certainly shall not discover now. One thing I am
convinced about. Her death links up with her miscarriage. She told
me once he was determined she should not go through with the
pregnancy.</squote>
   <p>Sandra gave a pained cry.
   <p><squote>Darling, I hinted that, too, you remember. I didn't want to
sound too dramatic, or &mdash; well &mdash;</squote>
   <p><squote>I know.</squote> She felt very sick as she sat there, desolate. It
was all so ugly.
   <p>Philip wanted to settle the problem &mdash; leave no loopholes.
   <p><squote>She lost either way, really. He wouldn't marry her, and he
dare not risk the threat of the child. Obviously it would have been a
handicap to her, too, and in her saner moments she must have been
thankful to get out of the mess... But she was neurotic. It's my
guess that the cottage episode was the beginning of the end for
her.</squote>
   <p>Sandra pressed the point. <squote>Meaning that Nicholas deliberately
got rid of the child?</squote>
   <p>Philip was far too deep in the lies to retreat from that direct
question.
   <p><squote>Yes. Her fear of him was pretty obvious. He had to take care
of her professionally, but he certainly didn't want you to know the
facts. She probably did. Beryl was a lonely person and had
very few friends.</squote>
   <p>Sandra nodded. <squote>Let's not talk of it again,</squote> she said dully.
<squote>I can't bear it... Everything's ready.</squote> She looked around her.
Part of her life was ending; a part she had loved. Leaving the flat
and staying at Monk's Toft would be an ordeal, despite the rest from
perpetual work.
   <p>Philip relaxed again. Now there was only the inquest, and he had
nothing whatsoever to fear from that. It was far too late for
Nicholas to make any accusations.
<head>EIGHTEEN</head>
   <p>THE inquest offered no surprise. Nicholas's evidence conformed
strictly to the law and ethics. Miss Graham had been in his care.
She had been in a highly nervous state. A verdict of suicide while
the balance of her mind was disturbed, was returned. Philip put down
the evening newspaper, looked at Gordon Neal, and said: <squote>Very sad.
Nicholas's testimony said everything and nothing. One never knows
the truth of these cases.</squote>
   <p>Sandra didn't speak. She felt that some part of her had
petrified, leaving only a shell. She lived mechanically, and while
physically rested, even as the days became a week and then two, she
found it impossible to overcome the desolation building up around her.
Philip was amazingly better and already busy on a new play. He
worked in bed, using a portable typewriter, and was completely
absorbed in his task. Sandra was there &mdash; to attend to all his
needs. His world was whole again and he, to himself, its hub. With
illness had come an intense instinct for self-preservation, a
concentration upon his desires. What was good for him; what was not.
Not overdoing it. The doctor recommended by Nicholas called each
week and then suggested that no further calls were necessary. Philip
felt like the child no longer centre stage.
   <p>It was Beatrice who said one evening after dinner, <squote>Hadn't we
better make some plans for the wedding? Quiet, of course.</squote>
   <p>Philip smiled smugly. <squote>They are made. I've a special licence
and notification has been given to the vicar. The best of having a
secretary,</squote> he added, talking of one he had acquired since leaving
London. <squote>Brandon's good. It only needs Sandra to name the day.</squote>
   <p>Gordon said curtly, <squote>It is usual for the bride's parents to
have some hand in all this, you know, Philip.</squote>
   <p>Philip bristled. <squote>It was never our intention to have one of
those carnival affairs,</squote> he retorted and in that second, he became
the man of success exerting authority.
   <p>Sandra watched her father's face pale. Philip, she knew, got on
his nerves, but everything had gone over her head. It didn't really
matter what was being said because she was no longer a part of it.
The thought of Nicholas haunted her, the sense of loss crucifying.
Her father's comment roused her as he said, <squote>I was not talking of a
carnival. But I presume we shall be allowed to have one or two of our
friends at the ceremony.</squote>

<text id=LOBP07>
   <p><quote>Yes, we were,</quote> she stammered out and hated herself for a
nervous stammer.
   <p><quote>Won't you two ladies both join me in a little drink then we can
all go into the dance room together.</quote>
   <p>Vera looked at Caroline. <quote>We shall be pleased to, Mr.
Carson,</quote> said Caroline.
   <p>David found them a small table pulled up three chairs waited
until the two were seated, then he said:
   <p><quote>I think this calls for a celebration. It is not often I have
the luck to be entertaining two such charming ladies. Excuse me a
moment.</quote>
   <p>As he strode off towards the bar, Vera said:
   <p><quote>Isn't he delightful?</quote>
   <p><quote>He seems nice. Perhaps he has taken a fancy to you, Vera.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not he. I told him on our first meeting that I was engaged to
a very nice young man.</quote>
   <p>At the bar David ordered a bottle of champagne and three glasses
to be sent over to his table. He thought that perhaps a glass or two
of champagne might get Miss Dodd into a friendly mood. He returned to
the table, sat down and offered them both a cigarette from his gold
case. They both took one, he flicked on his lighter and held it for
them then lit his own. A waiter came along with the glasses and the
champagne, he started to open the bottle.
   <p>Vera said:
   <p><quote>Champagne! This is certainly a celebration.</quote>
   <p>Later after they had finished the bottle of champagne and David
had taken care to see Caroline had had her glass filled three times
they adjourned to the dance room to dance. Vera immediately excused
herself to go off and dance with a man she knew.
   <p>David said:
   <p><quote>Shall we dance?</quote>
   <p><quote>I should love to.</quote>
   <p>The band had just started to play a waltz. David was a very good
dancer, rather to his surprise he found Caroline was also. Their
steps fitted excellently together. A waltz is one of the dances which
enables a man to get close to the woman. The moment he found she
danced as well as he did he drew her closer to him, she gave
willingly. When the dance came to a finish, he said:
   <p><quote>It is awfully hot in here. What about coming into the lounge
and having a cool drink?</quote>
   <p>Now while they had been dancing Caroline had not failed to notice
the eyes of quite a number of women were eyeing her with envy. She
thought it would be rather fun to walk off with this nice-looking man
into the lounge and leave them all annoyed.
   <p><quote>I think a nice cool drink would be nice. As you say it is very
hot in here.</quote>
   <p>Taking her by the arm David led her from the room into the
lounge. He beckoned over a waiter.
   <p><quote>What would you like to drink?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>A lemon squash with ice.</quote>
   <p>David ordered it, and a whisky and soda for himself. After they
had been served he said:
   <p><quote>I was taking a stroll the other morning and happened to pass by
your house. From the glance I obtained of the ground through the
gates you must have quite a wonderful garden.</quote>
   <p><quote>We have. I say we because it does not all belong to me, my
sister and I share the place between us.</quote>
   <p>Pretending he was unaware the sister was away he said:
   <p><quote>Doesn't your sister ever come here to dance?</quote>
   <p><quote>Often when she is at home. At the moment she is staying with
friends in Eastbourne.</quote>
   <p><quote>So you are all alone for the time?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not quite alone. I have the servants and lots of friends. Are
you staying long here?</quote>
   <p><quote>I wouldn't know. Depends on whether I get bored or not. When
I get bored I move on.</squote>
   <p><quote>Not bored yet I hope?</quote>
   <p><quote>I should never be bored in such charming company as yours.</quote>
   <p>In spite of herself Caroline felt herself flush.
   <p><quote>You must come and take a look round the grounds of the Manor
House one day, that is if you would care to do so.</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothing would give me greater pleasure. Can we make a definite
date?</quote>
   <p><quote>Come and have tea with me tomorrow afternoon at four o'clock.
After tea I will show you round the house and grounds.</quote>
   <p><quote>I shall be delighted to. Most kind of you to ask me.</quote>
   <p>Caroline was thinking, that will make some of the women in the
other room jealous when they hear I have landed this man to tea with
me.
   <p>David was thinking, I believe if I play my cards rightly I shall
land this woman in my arms in time. How wonderful it would be to
marry a quarter of a million pounds. He felt she had been on the
shelf for so long, if she really fell for him, once they were married,
he would have no difficulty in getting her to settle a nice sum on
him. Feeling it would not be wise to rush matters so soon he finished
his drink and suggested they returned to the dance room. Caroline
could do nothing but agree although she would have liked to stay and
continue talking with him.
   <p>Back in the dance room David found her a seat and went and asked
Vera to dance.
   <p><quote>Well, how do you like my friend Carrie?</quote> asked Vera as they
took the floor.
   <p><quote>I like her very much. She dances well and seems quite a
charming young woman.</quote>
   <p><quote>Carrie is a darling really. Just unfortunate for her she does
not possess the lovely looks of her sister. Every man in Gallows
Corner is mad on Susie.</quote>
   <p><quote>That I suppose leaves Miss Caroline rather out in the cold?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. They are both terribly wealthy. I have never been able
to understand why some man has not tried to snap up Carrie. She is
the sort who would make a good wife for a man.</quote>
   <p><quote>You don't think the sister would, is that it?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, that is not it. It is Susie, although she has heaps of
admirers she never seems to bother much about them. When at home she
is always too busy with her horses, riding to the hounds and taking
part in ladies' point-to-point races. Susie is a wonderful
horsewoman.</quote>
   <p>David had one more dance with Caroline later that evening then he
excused himself with the excuse he was feeling tired and thought he
would turn in. Saying he would be sure to be with her at four o'clock
the next afternoon, he said good night and left her.
   <p>David could see she was longing for him to stay and dance once
again with her. He knew he was doing the right thing in not doing so.
That would make her look forward all the more to the next day. He
went to bed feeling most satisfied with the evening.
<head>CHAPTER FOUR</head>
   <p>EVERYONE in Gallows Corner spoke of it as a whirlwind
engagement when it was announced two weeks later that Caroline Dodd
had become engaged to David Carson.
   <p>David had hurried his love-making up for the very good reason his
capital was fast disappearing and he was wise enough to know it would
never do to ask Caroline to lend him any money, after they were once
married he would see to it she made a settlement on him.
   <p>Caroline had never been made love to by such an experienced man
as David Carson, he literally swept her off her feet. She felt sure
she had at last found a man who would make her happy for life.
   <p>The moment the engagement was announced congratulations from most
of the women in Gallows Corner poured in to Caroline. The men had
varied opinions, the single ones began to feel annoyed they had not
tried to snap up such a wealthy woman in spite of her plain looks
before this Carson appeared, the married men told their wives Caroline
was a fool that they were sure Carson was merely wishing to marry her
for her money. Most of the wives argued the point, they, like their
single sisters, felt Caroline was lucky to have managed to get one of
the best-looking men they had ever seen.
   <p>David, who sensed the various opinions and felt some pressure
might eventually be brought to bear on Caroline to think again,
pleaded for an early marriage. She was not adverse to the suggestion,
but he had to use a deal of pressure before she would agree to a quick
marriage at a registry in Starminster. She wished for a marriage in a
church with bridesmaids. It was only when David said he was a Roman
Catholic, and unless he agreed to embrace her religion, it would not
be possible for him to marry her in the Church of England, that she at
last agreed to a registry marriage. Perhaps what finally decided her
was a letter she received from her sister, Susie, telling her not to
think of getting married until they had found out more about this
David Carson, than she had been able to tell her in her letter. Susie
said she would be returning to Gallows Corner the following week and
would like to meet this man and decide what she thought of him.
Knowing what a lovely girl her sister was, Caroline felt by doing so
she could be running the risk that David, once he set his eyes on
Susie, might change his mind about her so she told David to go into
Starminster and arrange the wedding as quickly as possible.
   <p>That fitted in well with David's plans. In Starminster he
arranged for them to be married in three days' time. It was only on
the morning before they were to get married that he arrived at the
Manor House pretending to look a very harassed man.
   <p><quote>Darling,</quote> he burst out with, <quote>I fear we shall have to
postpone our marriage for a few days.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why, David, why?</quote> cried Caroline, feeling alarmed he had
changed his mind.
   <p><quote>Well, dearest one, it is like this, when I left my apartment in
London for a short holiday I only drew from my bank enough cash to
last me about three weeks. The trouble now is, I left my cheque book
in my rooms and only recalled that I had done so about half an hour
ago. I must go back to London to get some more money, we cannot start
off on a honeymoon on the small amount I have left, and I've got to
pay my hotel bill in the morning. That is why I said we must postpone
our wedding until I get back.</quote>
   <p>David Carson had no apartment in London, he had no cheque book.
He had carefully thought out the lie he had just told hoping the
reaction to it would be Caroline would refuse to have her wedding
postponed and offer to lend him money enough to last until they
returned from their honeymoon. If her reaction was not like that and
she just said, very well, go to London and get back as quickly as
possible, he would then just have to disappear from Gallows Corner for
ever leaving his hotel bill unpaid. Luckily her reaction was what he
had hoped it would be.
   <p><quote>David, I simply won't agree to any postponement of our wedding
tomorrow. You are a silly to look so worried about the matter. I can
lend you whatever money you require until we return then you can pay
me back.</quote>
   <p><quote>That is sweet of you to say that, sweetheart, but I hardly like
to borrow from you the large amount I shall require for our
honeymoon.</quote>
   <p>David was continuing to play it up well.
   <p><quote>Don't be absurd, darling, I can advance you any amount you ask
for,</quote> said Caroline. <quote>Don't you know I am a very wealthy woman?</quote>
   <p>David pretended astonishment at this announcement.
   <p><quote>Heavens! Carrie, I had no idea you were a wealthy woman.
Naturally I thought you must have some money to be able to pay your
share of the keep up of the Manor House.

I shall serve them with tomatoes and olives, which I hope you will
enjoy.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm sure I shall. Your cooking's wonderful.</quote>
   <p>Julia lingered on in the room for another few minutes, then she
ventured cautiously downstairs again. Adrian was now sitting with the
Portuguese engineer and his silent wife, and another man, discussing
seafaring matters in English. Julia attached herself to Lieutenant
Robson, reminding him he had promised to play dominoes with her again.
Their game lasted till nearly ten o'clock when Se&ntilde;ora Gonzalez
commanded everybody inside for dinner. Adrian excused himself, said
<quote>goodnight</quote> with a meaningful glance which Julia chose to ignore,
and drove off in the jeep.
   <p>Julia felt depressed and a trifle sad as Luis conveyed her to Don
Felipe's house on Saturday morning. Just before she left the Tafira,
a message had been delivered from the shipping company, instructing
her to be at their offices on the quay at seven o'clock on Monday
morning ready to embark in the Juno for Southampton, sailing
punctually at ten. As she looked out at the white sunlit streets, and
the palms and the flowers, with glimpses of the blue sea and the
golden beaches between the buildings, Julia knew she did not want to
leave all this so soon. Yet in another forty-eight hours her holiday
would be over, and she would be on her way back to the grey English
winter and all the worries of finding a new job and a roof over her
head. She sighed, thinking how unkind fate could be at times.
   <p>The morning began just the same as the others. The old
flower-woman sat in her usual place, and as Julia mounted the steps to
the house, Alvaro opened the door and made his bow to her. Pepita was
wheeling a little wicker cart round the pool today, the white cat
sitting inside on a cushion. She rushed to meet her friend eagerly.
<quote>Yoo-li-ah! Yoo-li-ah!</quote>
   <p>When she had swept her curtsey, and held out the lace-trimmed
flounce of her frock for admiration, Pepita led Julia off to help her
push the cart. Soon they were chattering away gaily. <quote>El
helado,</quote> gurgled Pepita as the maid brought out two glass
dishes. <quote>Ice-cream,</quote> Julia insisted. They both thought it quite
funny when they discovered chocolate was the same in both languages.
Suddenly Julia realised she was going to miss this little Spanish
child, so full of affection and the simple joy of life. It was
impossible to feel dull when Pepita was there.
   <p>Julia said as much to Don Felipe when he came home.
   <p><quote>I haven't the heart to say goodbye,</quote> she remarked as they
watched the maid pick up the little girl ready to carry her off to the
nursery. <quote>I've enjoyed Pepita so much.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ah, yes. You propose to sail home in the Juno, do you
not?</quote>
   <p><quote>That's right, alas. And you won't want me here tomorrow, as
it's Sunday, of course.</quote>
   <p><quote>I must tell Pepita then,</quote> he said firmly. <quote>You cannot be
allowed to part without exchanging your farewells. It would not be
courteous.</quote>
   <p>He spoke rapidly in Spanish and the result was extraordinary.
Hastily the maid set the child down again and retreated into the
background. Pepita stood there staring at Julia with all the
happiness draining out of her pretty little face. Her black eyes
filled with anguish, the tears brimming over and coursing down her
cheeks. Without speaking a word, she flung herself upon Julia,
seizing the girl round the knees. When Julia bent to try and comfort
her, Pepita uttered a heartrending wail and then broke into a torrent
of excited Spanish punctuated by screams and sobs.
   <p><quote>Pepita does not wish you to leave her,</quote> Don Felipe said
quietly. <quote>She is desolate, as indeed I am myself.</quote>
   <p><quote>This is awful,</quote> Julia exclaimed in consternation. <quote>Do
please tell her to stop crying, Don Felipe. I can't bear it. If you
could explain it isn't that I really want to go home. I just have
to.</quote>
   <p>Her father spoke to the child, but she went on weeping.
   <p><quote>Yoo-li-ah! Yoo-li-ah!</quote> she moaned beseechingly, still
clinging to the girl's knees and refusing to be lifted up.
   <p><quote>Oh, dear!</quote> Julia exclaimed. <quote>Whatever can I do?</quote>
   <p><quote>You could remain in Las Palmas,</quote> Don Felipe pointed out.
<quote>That would make my Pepita so happy again. It is rarely she finds a
companion who is as congenial to her as you obviously are.</quote>
   <p><quote>But how can I stay?</quote> Julia began. <quote>I only wish I
could.</quote>
   <p><quote>I should be only too delighted to engage you as governess for
Pepita,</quote> he answered. <quote>You would soon acquire sufficient Spanish
to be able to help her with her first lessons. You could read to her,
and sing with her and so on. Enlarge her knowledge of English still
more. It would not be arduous, and naturally I would pay you an ample
salary. So will you not agree to spend the winter in Las Palmas, Miss
Barclay, and dry Pepita's tears?</quote>
   <p>Julia hesitated. It was certainly an exciting offer, far more
attractive than going back to London. She might continue to live at
the Hotel Tafira for the next few months, enjoying the climate and the
friendly beach and caf&eacute; life. And there was Don Felipe himself,
the handsome man watching her now with an unaccustomed trace of
anxiety in his eyes. Feminine intuition told Julia he wanted her to
stay on for his own sake as well as Pepita's. It was flattering to
know a man like this one considered you important to him.
   <p>She realised she was weakening, but then all at once she
remembered what she had heard the previous evening. Yet it was
probably no more than gossip that Mrs Henderson had repeated, and
what Se&ntilde;ora Gonzalez had told her cast no reflection on Don Felipe
either. He could not be blamed for his father's state of mind.
Adrian had said she might be running into danger with him, but Adrian
could be wrong, and anyway it was no business of his what Julia
Barclay did. He had no right to dictate to her, behaving in that
high-handed fashion. She felt herself stiffening again as she
remembered his voice and manner. She would show Adrian he was
completely wrong, and stupidly old-fashioned at that. She found Don
Felipe fascinating from every aspect. She lifted her eyes to smile at
him now.
   <p><quote>You make it sound too tempting,</quote> she surrendered. <quote>Very
well, then, if you do really think I'm capable of being Pepita's
teacher. I've never done anything of that sort before, you know.</quote>
   <p><quote>I am quite satisfied,</quote> he replied. <quote>So you will stay, Miss
Barclay?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I will. And thank you ... Do please tell Pepita. I
can't bear to see her like this.</quote>
   <p>She watched the child's expression change as her father spoke to
her. She ceased to sob and the light stole back into her face again.
For a few moments she gazed up at Julia doubtfully, incredulously.
Then gradually the dark eyes grew bright once more, and even began to
sparkle as was their wont. Julia lifted her up, and she immediately
wound her small arms round the girl's neck, nuzzling her cheek,
snuggling against her hair. Don Felipe smiled as he watched them.
   <p><quote>Pepita is restored,</quote> he said. <quote>We are both most grateful to
you.</quote>
   <p>There was a rustling sound behind them, and Julia half-turned to
see Do&ntilde;a Beatriz standing on the tiles. It was the first time
Julia had ever met the older woman outside the dining-room. One
moment Do&ntilde;a Beatriz was in her vision, a tall black figure staring
at the little scene. The next she was gone again. Julia was almost
convinced her eyes must have deceived her. Pepita was finally carried
off to the nursery, and as Don Felipe led the way indoors to luncheon,
Do&ntilde;a Beatriz was already there, sitting in her accustomed chair at
the foot of the long table. She bowed gravely to Julia, acknowledging
the girl's greeting, and began to serve in her usual silence. Julia
had already realised there was something quite off-beat about Do&ntilde;a
Beatriz, so she was careful to address only Don Felipe at her side
throughout the meal.
   <p>They discussed the fiesta, which he waved aside as a trifling
celebration in Las Palmas.
   <p><quote>In the country it is much more important,</quote> he said.
<quote>Harvest is something for which we offer gratitude indeed there. I
shall be out at my own estate in the morning, marking the day with my
workpeople. My land is around the village of San Bernardo, a
beautiful valley with many foothills. I have a large house there
beside the river. You must see it one day.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I should like to.</quote>
   <p><quote>You have not penetrated the interior of the island yet? No?
It will surprise you. The mountains are so majestic they take the
breath away when they are viewed for the first time.</quote>
   <p><quote>You've another house at Tojeda, haven't you?</quote> Julia
remembered. <quote>On the cliffs &mdash; somebody was telling me &mdash;</quote> Then she
stopped abruptly, realising what she was saying.
   <p>Don Felipe had begun to peel himself a peach. He completed the
delicate operation before he answered. Then he laid down his silver
knife and looked at Julia directly as he spoke.
   <p><quote>So. People have talked about me. I wonder what else they said
about Tojeda. No, do not trouble to tell me, Miss Barclay. I can
guess. I know what scandal is tossed about in the caf&eacute;s and
hotels.</quote>
   <p>Julia felt a trifle uncomfortable.
   <p><quote>I didn't really pay great attention,</quote> she began, but
imperiously he cut her short.
   <p><quote>We will discuss this matter later,</quote> he said, <quote>when we may be
private. Now tell me, have you been to the aquariums yet? ...</quote>
   <p>As soon as the meal ended, Do&ntilde;a Beatriz slipped away as usual
and Don Felipe indicated that Julia was to follow him.
   <p><quote>We will go to my study,</quote> he decided. <quote>I have to speak to
you about Pepita's education among other things.</quote>
   <p>He led Julia to a wing of the house she had not seen before.
Like all the rest, this room was richly furnished, with handsome red
brocade curtains, and a carved mahogany desk and chairs. Don Felipe
unlocked a drawer and handed Julia an envelope.
   <p><quote>Your salary to date,</quote> he explained. <quote>On Monday we begin our
new arrangement, of course. I had thought ...</quote> He named a figure
which Julia knew was generous in the extreme. <quote>So you will be here
at the same time then. The car will call for you as usual.</quote>
   <p><quote>Thank you very much, Don Felipe. I'll do my best.</quote>
   <p>She waited, thinking he was going to talk to her about his
daughter, and what he wanted a governess to do, but Don Felipe made no
mention of Pepita now. Instead he frowned to himself for a moment, as
though lost in thought. Then he lifted his head and asked quietly:
   <p><quote>I wonder what tales you have heard about me, Miss Barclay.
Could you not repeat them to me?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I don't quite know &mdash;</quote> Julia hesitated.
   <p>Don Felipe twisted his lips into a wry smile.
   <p><quote>It was obviously unflattering to me,</quote> he remarked.
   <p><quote>But there is no need to be embarrassed, Miss Barclay. I know
what is said on the island. Loose tongues wag here just as they do
everywhere else. Gran Canaria is certainly a paradise, but it has its
serpents too.</quote>
   <p>He paused to consider her. Julia returned his glance
sympathetically, appreciating that it was not easy for this man to
bare his innermost feelings. Don Felipe continued:
   <p><quote>You have plainly heard uncharitable comments about me, so you
must permit me to tell you the facts myself. Seven years ago I
married the daughter of one of my fellow landowners, Don Miguel \de
Francia. We were deeply in love and very happy. After Pepita's
birth, the doctors informed my wife that she could bear no more
children. Naturally it was a tremendous grief. We had hoped for sons
to carry on our name.

<text id=LOBP09>
<QUOTE>
The best thing we can do seems to be to concentrate on work,
doesn't it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Under Rufus Horgan!</quote> he said.
   <p>Andrea flinched. For a moment she had forgotten that, and now
the sting in his voice made her think he was trying to hurt her. Not
that she could have blamed him. Then she remembered how he had been
passed over, and realised how he must feel. And on top of that to
have almost won her, only to see for himself how the idea suddenly
revolted her. No, she couldn't blame him for wanting to hurt her!
   <p><quote>Under him, as you say,</quote> she agreed dully. <quote>It's life, I
suppose. And now &mdash; goodbye.</quote>
   <p><quote>Will you be here or at the house tomorrow?</quote>
   <p><quote>Here &mdash; to begin with. Goodbye.</quote>
   <p>On the second attempt, she got away. She could not bear to let
him know Mark had not made any definite arrangements about her going
to his home again.
   <p>Perhaps never, she thought, when at last she was in her own room,
staring at her white face in the mirror. Perhaps she had given
herself away too blatantly, and he would keep clear of her. He had
Pauline to interpret his wants, so perhaps any typist would do &mdash;
   <p>Next day, a sickening desert of hours in the office, it seemed
she was right. There was no phone call for her. Normally she could
have telephoned the house to ask how he was, but now she was too
ashamed. Then, late in the afternoon, when she had ceased hoping to
hear his voice every time her telephone rang, Gus answered a call.
She stiffened, listening.
   <p><quote>Oh, it's you, Mark?</quote> she heard him say. <quote>Still making-out?
Fine! Something you want us to do here?</quote>
   <p>Andrea trembled. She kept her pencil moving and her head bent,
but she was straining to hear every word.
   <p><quote>Oh, hell!</quote> was all Gus said at first. The receiver crackled
for a while, and then: <quote>Well, we'll go through with it. You know
you can trust Andrea and me. The guy needn't know we hate his guts
for coming here instead of you. You want me in on your first
conference? O.K. Thanks a lot &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Mark must have said goodbye then, for the American put down the
receiver. She felt him looking across at her, but would not look up
until he said:
   <p><quote>Horgan's coming tomorrow. I guess I'd better go and break it
to the boys in the lab.</quote>
   <p>He eased himself up and ambled off. By the time he came back,
she had taken a grip on her whirling emotions, managed to sound cool
when she spoke.
   <p><quote>Gus,</quote> she said, <quote>what about that leakage business? Does
Dr. Horgan have to know?</quote>
   <p><quote>He'll have to know I suppose. It'll all come out in the
handover. Now, if I could just trip over one of my own feet, or
something, and didn't have to meet him tomorrow over at Mark's
place &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't be absurd. You have to keep your job.</quote>
   <p><quote>And I have to bring him back and induct him here, and the
scientist in me sure hates it. Understand?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. And I'm sure Mark does, too. I'm sure everyone feels the
same.</quote>
   <p><quote>They're taking it badly in the lab. You know, I think Mark's
latest theory about the leakage &mdash; that it was just coincidence &mdash; was
right. I can't see any of those boys letting out a word of what
passes here, even if they know &mdash; which, thanks to the system, none of
us really does.</quote>
   <p><quote>I think it's all over, anyway. Any instructions for me
tomorrow, while you're away?</quote>
   <p><quote>Just see the place is all spruced up and no dust on the
files,</quote> he said with an attempt at an understanding grin. <quote>And
have one of the girls from the typing school warned she may be needed.
Mark will want you with him and Horgan quite a bit. I've to run the
show here until he has everything sewn up. Though how I shall do it,
I just don't know.</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll manage perfectly,</quote> she said automatically.
   <p>He said nothing more. Next morning she was in charge of the
office; Gus didn't come back for lunch, which she had a vision of
Pauline serving to the three scientists.
   <p>Andrea ate in the canteen hastily, but forcing herself to mix
with the other girls as though today was just like any other day &mdash; as
it was to them. The shock and sensation of Mark's blindness was over,
and unless his successor turned out to be young and attractive they
were barely interested.
   <p>The moment she glimpsed Dr. Horgan through the office window,
getting out of Gus' car, she knew he was no heart-throb. He wore
rimless glasses, was short, conventionally dressed and
dedicated-looking. Mark, without his height and personal magnetism,
she supposed bitterly.
   <p>Then the two men came into the office, and Gus was introducing
her. Dr. Horgan's eyes behind his spectacles were friendly and his
smile kind.
   <p><quote>Dr. Pentland told me about you, Miss Holme,</quote> he said,
shaking hands. <quote>I'm sure we shall work well as a team &mdash; and I'm to
have the benefit of sitting-in on your work with him for a time. The
idea is that we meet and work at his home in the mornings and I remain
behind for fuller discussion in the afternoon. Today I'm simply
looking round &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Gus led the way, showing him what had been Mark's desk and his
small inner office which he had used for highly secret work. Then
they went off to the lab and the other departments, and Andrea could
drop the forced smile from her lips and stare into space.
   <p>It sounded as though she might never again be alone with Mark.
   <p>Why should she want to be? she asked herself furiously. Why
offer herself again and again for punishment?
   <p>The door opened and Gus came back.
   <p><quote>Leaving him to get acquainted,</quote> he explained.
   <p><quote>Did you see Pauline?</quote>
   <p>He blinked, looking at her vaguely. <quote>Did I? Sure. She served
us a pretty good lunch.
   <p><quote>She's certainly settled down. Old Mark seems to rely on her
quite a bit.</quote>
   <p>Even if the words were not meant as a barb they drove deep into
Andrea's heart.
<head>CHAPTER 14</head>
<head>Talk Of Pity</head>
   <p>FOR Andrea the next few days were terrible. Not only for
herself, but in knowing Mark's agony in gradually transferring his
affairs, including his confidential secretary, to the older man.
Particularly the agony of those talks from which even she was
excluded, when he confided the highly secret details of his
discoveries.
   <p>The only way she could get through the days was by turning
herself into a sort of robot and trying not to think &mdash; not to feel
when she saw from Mark's expression that his head was aching with
strain. Not to care that behind the very dark glasses, that gave him
such a distinguished look, were eyes that could not see.
   <p>It was about ten days before Dr. Horgan worked in the factory
office, when he dictated a few letters after returning from Mark's
home. And then one afternoon Horgan came soon after lunch. Andrea
saw him drive up and get out briskly.
   <p><quote>Dr. Pentland has some jobs for you, Miss Holme,</quote> he said,
striding in. <quote>Call in a typist for me and go over to him, will you?
I may not get back there today &mdash; it depends on the work here.</quote>
   <p>Andrea telephoned the typing pool. As she did so, she met Gus'
eyes. This is the take-over, they said, as plainly as speech, and she
knew that it was true. This might be the very last time she would go
to the Pentlands' home to work for Mark...
   <p>It was a lovely afternoon, mockingly lovely. Once the
rectangular steel-and-glass blocks of the factory were behind her and
she was cycling along the short-cut, she might have been in the heart
of unspoilt country.
   <p>There was a drone of bees in the roses over the porch of the
house, and a great bowl of half-opened roses on the old chest in the
hall. Pauline, Andrea thought, as she turned into Mark's office &mdash; and
then the flicker of jealousy roared up into a great burning flame.
For Pauline was in the office with Mark &mdash; very close to him. Andrea
had a horrible impression that they sprang apart as she entered.
   <p><quote>Oh &mdash;</quote> the blonde exclaimed, turning. <quote>I didn't hear you.</quote>
   <p>For a moment Andrea thought she was going to burst into tears so
overwhelming was the certainty that all her vague feelings about
Pauline and Mark had been only too well founded.
   <p>And then her throbbing pulses steadied, for she saw there were
books scattered over the carpet between them, and an overturned bowl
of roses. Pink, cream and scarlet, they were lying everywhere.
   <p><quote>Dr. Horgan said you wanted me &mdash;</quote> she got out.
   <p><quote>I do.</quote> Mark turned his head in her direction, while his
hands groped for the back of a nearby chair. <quote>But I've just been
extremely clumsy, trying to find my way around. Knocked something
over and turned the whole room into a shambles, apparently!</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, no &mdash; it's not so bad as that.</quote> Pauline stooped and began
dabbing at the water on the carpet with a scarf she had pulled from
her neck. <quote>It's just a good thing I hadn't left to do your mother's
shopping before you shouted for me.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't worry. Andrea could have cleared up.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why yes, of course. But I didn't know she was coming. It's
all my fault, Mark, not warning you where the flowers were.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, leave it, now, or you'll miss your bus.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. I'd better get another pair of gloves &mdash;</quote>
   <p>The girl was wearing her outdoor coat &mdash; fabric gloves, and big
china earrings that, as usual, warred with the rest of her outfit.
She was strangely breathless. As for Mark, unless it was a trick of
the light, he looked very white.
   <p>Was it true that Pauline had dashed in in response to a shout
from him when everything cascaded down off the top of the bookcase?
Or had there been a love scene, when some clumsy movement of Mark's
might have caused the accident? There was certainly a strange tension
in the air.
   <p><quote>You don't mind fetching a cloth from the kitchen?</quote> Pauline
asked. <quote>I simply must run!</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll see to it. Don't worry.</quote>
   <p>Andrea wheeled and went off, leaving them to say what they liked
to each other. But Pauline came out at once. Andrea heard her go
racing upstairs, then the rapid opening and shutting of a drawer and
her footsteps coming down again.
   <p><quote>So sorry to trouble you!</quote> she called, turning her fair head
to flash the other girl a smile as they passed in the hall.
   <p>As Pauline ran out and down the drive, Andrea braced herself and
walked back into the office. Mark was still standing where she had
left him &mdash; she had to go down almost at his feet, to mop up the water.
   <p><quote>I'll rearrange the flowers and I'd better get a towel to dry
the books,</quote> she said, trying to sound casual and failing. There
was something in the atmosphere! It could only mean she had
blundered in on a love scene, however unpremeditated and brief it
might have been.
   <p><quote>Do, please,</quote> Mark said curtly.
   <p>It seemed to take hours of coming and going, and all the time he
stood there, until he must have known by her silence that it was all
cleared up.
   <p><quote>Have you finished?</quote> he asked. <quote>Sorry to be such a clumsy
oaf. Better get down to work now, hadn't we? It's really only a few
personal letters.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm ready. Aren't you going to sit down?</quote>
   <p><quote>Thanks, I'd rather stand &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He paced up and down, feeling his way by the chairs that were
always strategically placed for him. His mind was obviously
distracted &mdash; these letters to people who had written sympathetically
about his tragedy seemed to give him more trouble than the most
intricate scientific calculations.

<text id=LOBP10>
   <p>Gaby touched his wrist. <quote>Now that we are in my country, will
you allow me to choose for you a really French meal?</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course.</quote>
   <p>As she gave the order to the waiter, using her hands so
expressively it was difficult for Rob to imagine why she had singled
him out. She could surely have had any man she wished. She was
looking very young tonight, and, as usual, indescribably beautiful, in
a simple strapless dress of a green and white silky cotton. Her
shoulders and face were still tanned, and in this light the shade of
her hair had deepened to a burnt honey.
   <p>She met his gaze. <quote>You are looking at me again, Rob.</quote>
   <p><quote>I was just thinking how lovely you are. You make me say all
the things I never thought I could say aloud.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not even to Diana?</quote> There was a glint in her eye.
   <p><quote>We won't mention Diana tonight,</quote> he said abruptly. <quote>I don't
want to make comparisons.</quote> He sounded pompous, but he did not want
to be made to feel guilty this evening, of all times.
   <p><quote>No, of course not.</quote> She was silent while the first course of
steaming artichokes, soaked in a buttery sauce, was served.
   <p>Then her smile dazzled him. <quote>I hope you have a good appetite
tonight, Rob. I have ordered a lot of things.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll eat them somehow, then we'll walk it off afterwards.</quote>
   <p>There was blue trout next, then a young chicken that had been
cooked in wine and herbs, finally a platter of cheese and fruit.
   <p>Rob took a deep breath. <quote>I think that was the best meal I've
ever eaten. I think of beans on toast in Birmingham and shudder. Or
spaghetti. I won't like going to Italy!</quote>
   <p><quote>Will you ever go back, Rob?</quote> she asked, skinning a peach with
absorbed skill.
   <p><quote>Not if I can help it. That phase of my life is over.</quote>
   <p><quote>And the future, Rob, what do you look for in the future?</quote>
   <p><quote>Whatever comes,</quote> he said lightly. <quote>This is a see-saw
business. I'll stay at the top just as long as I can, then try to
accept defeat as gracefully as I can.</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll stay at the top for years, Rob. We both will. I know
that,</quote> she said vehemently. <quote>Before we are finished, everyone in
Paris, Rome and New York will have heard all about Rob Martin, the
famous British singer.</quote> She leaned across the table so that the
perfume of her hair drifted up to him. <quote>With the two of us in
partnership, we can go a long way. You do believe that?</quote>
   <p>The expression in her eyes was hidden from the lamplight. He
looked at her for a long time. Then he said slowly, <quote>Yes, I believe
that. I believe that, with you, I could do just about anything anyone
asked me.</quote>
   <p>She sat back smiling triumphantly. <quote>We shall sing our way round
the world, Rob. Perhaps we shall be invited to those cities we have
only read about. People will talk of us as they did of Nelson Eddy
and Jeannette Macdonald. That was a long time ago, I know, but no
singing partnership achieved quite the fame they did. But we will,
Rob, we will,</quote> she ended fiercely, and she gripped his hand as
though she would never let it go.
   <p>Abruptly he said, <quote>I'll pay the bill and we'll walk down to the
sea. I want to see if it's as clear as they say it is.</quote>
   <p>They took off their shoes, and the sand was soft and smooth
beneath their feet. By the time they came to the sea the lights of
the terrace looked a long way off. Rob bent and put his hand in the
water. It was warm and still.
   <p>Gaby said impishly, <quote>Let's paddle. No one can see us from
there.</quote>
   <p>Rob tucked up his trousers and she kicked her nylons towards the
high, white sandals. They waded into the shallow water.
   <p><quote>Look across there.</quote> He pointed the way they had driven
earlier. The whole coast was like a strip of twinkling stars. <quote>We
could be on an island, cut off from all those people there. In fact,
I wish we were. I don't want to go back.</quote>
   <p><quote>Neither do I, Rob. If you are going to stay, then I shall stay
with you.</quote>
   <p>He turned towards her. Her face looked very pale in the
darkness. A strange, burning feeling was creeping over his body. He
felt as though he were poised on the brink of some new, wonderful
experience.
   <p><quote>Gaby...</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, Rob?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, Gaby, Gaby!</quote>
   <p>Her lips were cool and smooth under his, and her cheeks were
like silk. He held her, wanting to retain this moment all his life,
the two of them in the warm, shimmering darkness, rocking gently to
and fro in the rustling water.
   <p>When at last he released her, he was still feeling dizzy from the
impact. Without speaking they gripped each other's hands, and walked
back to the dry sand and sat down.
   <p>Gaby started to rub at her feet with a wisp of a handkerchief.
She had amazingly small feet. But everything about her was petite.
   <p>She said at last, <quote>I've been waiting a long time for you to do
that, Rob.</quote>
   <p><quote>You have?</quote> He was amazed. Then his arm came round her bare
shoulders. <quote>I suppose I've wanted it too, but I've been afraid.</quote>
   <p><quote>Afraid?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. Afraid that you would push me away, and then everything
would have been over before it started. I couldn't have stood that.
I think I felt this way about you the moment I saw you at the Savoy
party. People laugh about love at first sight, but sometimes it's
true &mdash; only you don't see it at the time.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then you do love me?</quote> she said slowly.
   <p><quote>Oh, yes. You've hit me like... like a boomerang.</quote>
   <p><quote>And what about...?</quote>
   <p><quote>... Diana? Yes, I know.</quote> Was it only this morning that he
had told Diana he loved her? He had believed it then, and in an odd
sort of way it was still true. He did love Diana, but it was nothing
like this flame that blazed within him when he was with Gaby. The man
who first said there were many faces of love was right. He went on
slowly, <quote>I don't know what to say about her. I can't let her down
just like that, yet one day it will have to come. I can see that
now.</quote>
   <p><quote>Rob.</quote> She rested her head against his shoulder. Her perfume
had none of the gentle scent of Diana's. It was some excitingly
subtle blend that tore at his senses. <quote>We have our careers to think
of first of all. I think it would be best to go for a little while as
we were, seeing more of each other perhaps, getting to know each
other, but doing nothing definite. A romance can do no harm to our
publicity at the moment, but marriage must wait. Don't you agree?</quote>
   <p><quote>I suppose so. But it's you I want above everything.</quote> He was
startled that she put their publicity so firmly before their private
life, but she was probably right; there was still time to get to know
more about each other. Aloud he said, <quote>I never imagined anything
like this would happen when we both were invited to Monte Carlo.</quote>
   <p><quote>And would you still have come if you had guessed, Rob?</quote> she
asked quietly.
   <p>He smiled into the darkness. <quote>Yes, I would. Of course I would,
that's the glorious part of it. Oh, Gaby!</quote> He turned and kissed
her again, running his hand through her hair. <quote>I think I must be the
luckiest man in the world.</quote>
   <p>They lay on the sand a little longer, talking, listening to the
sound of the sea, and the breeze rustling through the pine trees
behind them, and just dreaming. Then Gaby said, <quote>Rob, if you want
to stop for a few moments at Cannes, perhaps we had better go.
Tomorrow night will be exhausting. I shall never be able to face
it.</quote>
   <p>He jumped up. <quote>I had forgotten all about tomorrow. How selfish
of me. It doesn't seem quite real somehow, after this.</quote>
   <p>He drove along the coast in high spirits, their voices joining in
the liquid melody of their new song. At Cannes he parked near the
harbour, and they found a pavement caf&eacute; and sat for a while,
watching the boats and drinking black coffee.
   <p><quote>Funny,</quote> he mused. <quote>This is what I always imagined myself
doing in the South of France, sitting idly, drinking coffee, watching
the people and the boats. And aren't some of the boats fabulous?</quote>
   <p>They lit up the harbour, some miniature liners, launches, speed
boats and small, colourful sailing dinghies. They seemed joined in a
community of their own.
   <p>He and Gaby watched in silence, holding hands. For the moment
everything had been said. They were content merely to be together.
Reluctantly then, they went back to the car and to the hotel.
   <p>Outside Gaby's room he said, <quote>I wonder what time band call will
be?</quote>
   <p><quote>I've heard in the morning, but I'm not sure.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then we'll have time for a swim in the afternoon. Is that a
date?</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a date. Goodnight, Rob, and thank you.</quote> She put up her
face for his kiss. <quote>Sweet dreams.</quote>
   <p><quote>They'll be sweet all right. I shall be dreaming of you.</quote>
   <p>He drew back the curtains and let the sea breeze in before he got
into bed. He lay awake for a long time, thinking about the evening
and the whole day that lay ahead. It was all too short, but he
intended to hold on to it tightly with both hands.
   <p>He breakfasted alone, learning with disappointment that Gaby was
having hers in her room. He had been particularly looking forward to
this, breakfast in the cool of the morning on the broad terrace,
looking straight out to sea. There would have been something
particularly intimate about it. He toyed with the warm rolls and
cherry jam, but drank two large cups of coffee.
   <p>Their call came about eleven o'clock. He went up and knocked on
Gaby's door.
   <p><quote>I missed you this morning,</quote> he said, when they drew apart.
   <p><quote>You'll have to get used to my bad morning habits,</quote> she teased
him. <quote>I never get up unless I have to. Even for someone like
you.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'll try to remember. Shall we go now?</quote> He reached for her
hand. She looked this morning as though she had stepped straight out
of the sunshine. She wore a full white skirt of some silky material
and a yellow top. She looked slim and tiny and he badly wanted to
protect her.
   <p>They worked hard for the rest of the morning. The producer
wanted nothing less than perfection. Again and again the same acts
were called for a repeat. Rob watched, amazed, as many more
professional stars than himself were made to run through their words
or their music five or six times.
   <p>It was a cosmopolitan gathering of stars. There were English,
American, French, Italian, and a couple from Brazil. Rob began by
feeling overawed before realizing that most of them had probably come
up the same way as he had.
   <p>The rehearsal finished at last and they all trooped in to lunch,
arguing good-humouredly about how the evening's performance should be
staged. Rob did not have a chance to be alone with Gaby until after
three o'clock when most of the others had gone to their rooms to rest.
   <p><quote>Still game for a swim?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>I'll fetch my things and be with you in five minutes.</quote>
   <p>For half an hour they splashed about in the water, more clear and
blue than Rob had believed possible. Then they lay in long
deck-chairs, dozing under their striped umbrellas.
   <p>Rob reached for Gaby's hand after a few minutes, but she was
asleep, looking as deeply at peace as a young child.
   <p>He lay back in his chair.

<head>CHAPTER ONE</head>
<head>Southern Ireland August, 1940</head>
   <p>DUSK WAS softening the coastline of County Kerry as Diana
West turned reluctantly from her window to go downstairs.
   <p>She hesitated on the landing, remembering that Gregory disliked
cr&egrave;pe-soled  brogues and tweeds, and knowing that he would
make some barbed remark about her wearing her
<quote>Lady-Bountiful-uniform</quote> in the gracious drawing-room of Rosebrae.
Six months of being Mrs. Gregory West had taught Diana that the
only thing to do was to grow a protective shell and to let her
husband's arrowed words glance off unnoticed. Not that they hurt any
the less for being ignored; sometimes the ache and the bewilderment
and the disillusion was so fierce that the future became a burden to
be endured and never never a happiness to be anticipated.
   <p>Now, her young mouth set and a bleak expression in her dark brown
eyes, she went down to where an elderly manservant was beckoning to
her from the hall.
   <p><quote>You're late,</quote> he reproved. <quote>I was nearly coming to fetch
you. Come in here a minute, Miss Diana, there's a thing I have to
show you before you go in there.</quote>
   <p>He nodded towards the drawing-room and then steered her into the
unlit butler's pantry next door.
   <p><quote>But, Fergus &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Wheesht! Stay here &mdash; I'll be right back.</quote>
   <p>With a faint smile Diana leaned on the table in front of her and
prepared to wait as Fergus had ordered. He had been her father's
batman in the First World War and for twenty years after that he had
bullied and served and adored the whole family, with the exception of
his master's sister Miss Charlotte Cavendish. <quote>A poor fool woman,</quote>
was the kindest thing he had ever said of her, and angry tears stood
in his eyes when his master's will was read and he heard that his
beloved and orphaned Diana was left in the care of Miss Charlotte.
His dislike and distrust were returned in full measure by that lady
and by Gregory West, but he was Diana's man and she would as soon do
without an arm as do without her oldest friend, Fergus Burke.
   <p>A moment after Fergus left the pantry Diana became aware of a bar
of light in the dimness, and moving along a bit she saw that the
serving hatch was slightly open at one side giving a narrow view of
the drawing-room. Without curiosity because it was such a familiar
scene, Diana watched her aunt presiding behind the tea-tray.
Firelight gleamed on silver and fine china, and lamplight flattered
the smooth skin and fading fair hair of Miss Charlotte.
   <p><quote>Diana's late again,</quote> she said, passing a plate of hot
buttered scones to Gregory. <quote>Really, we don't see much of her at all
these days.</quote>
   <p>He shrugged. <quote>She's probably taking soup or whatever it is to
her ghastly villagers. Beats me how she can bear to enter their
hovels!</quote>
   <p><quote>Do try not to be any more ignorant than you already are!</quote>
Miss Charlotte snapped. <quote>You seem to have taken all your ideas about
what you call <squote>the landed gentry</squote> from Victorian novels. Diana has
lots of responsibilities here and you ought to help her out with some
of them instead of sitting around here like an ornament. And you
needn't glare at me like that! We know each other too well for either
of us to put on an act when we're alone, and if I hadn't had a soft
spot for your father long ago I would have left you to go to the devil
in your own way!</quote>
   <p>Diana drew back from the hatch, her mind a riot of emotions as
she realised that she was deliberately eavesdropping and that her aunt
and Gregory weren't strangers as they had led everyone to believe.
   <p>Fergus gripped her arm and she jumped. <quote>This is no time for
party manners!</quote> he hissed. <quote>Many a choice bit I've heard here and
I thought it was time you heard it too. They're in a girning mood
today and that's why I wanted you down earlier, so keep your ears
skint!</quote>
   <p>Without a scuffle Diana couldn't get away from the determined
Fergus, and almost against her will she looked once more into the
drawing-room.
   <p><quote>And another thing,</quote> Miss Charlotte was saying, <quote>we didn't
finish what we were talking about when tea was brought in. Diana will
soon be twenty-one and I have no intention of being done out of my
share of our bargain just because you can't hold her.</quote>
   <p>Gregory laughed softly and smoothed his brown wavy hair. <quote>I can
get any woman, and keep her. Every woman needs to be shown who's
master and in the end they love it, and Diana's no different.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh yes she is. You can't class girls like Diana with the
<squote>women</squote> you've known. She was fresh home from finishing school &mdash;
and heaven knows it might as well have been an enclosed convent for
all she knew of life &mdash; you swept her off her feet, and she was all
prepared to love you for ever. But what happens? You seem to have
frightened her to death, because she's just a shadow of the girl she
was six months ago. I'm warning you, Gregory, when a Cavendish digs
her toes in neither you nor any man living will move her.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're just getting anxious about your twenty thousand quid,</quote>
Gregory muttered, but some of the assurance had gone from his voice.
<quote>Oh all right, just to please you I'll start being the niminy-piminy
lover she seems to expect, but honestly, Charlotte, she's such an
innocent and she always looks so &mdash; so untouched that any man would
lose patience and want to bring her down to earth.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not any man,</quote> Miss Charlotte said coldly, and anger
glinted in her pale eyes. <quote>Your father may have been a bit of a
rogue but he was also a gentleman, and that you will never be. He
would have kept his sights fixed on the Cavendish wealth and he would
have had Diana eating out of his hand until she would have begged him
to take over the management of her money when she was twenty-one. I
begin to regret that I groomed you for this part for which you have
turned out to be so manifestly unsuited, but if you don't hand over to
me that twenty thousand pounds within a month or two after Diana's
birthday be very sure that all the regrets will be yours.</quote>
   <p>A wave of nausea hit Diana and she bent over to rest her clammy
forehead on her hands. Beside her, Fergus muttered black oaths and
heaped imprecations on the two conspirators, his hand resting gently
on her bowed head. Then the bell tinkled above their heads and he
smoothed his jacket before going into the drawing-room.
   <p><quote>I'll say you're not home yet,</quote> he whispered. <quote>You'll need
time to think. But lassie, I had to do it, I just had to do it.</quote>
   <p>Left alone, Diana straightened and looked dully at the hatch. No
one ever remembered that it was there as it was never used. On the
other side it looked like part of the white panelling, as did the one
on the opposite wall of the pantry which led to the dining-room and
which was used every day. Neither Miss Charlotte nor Gregory were
welcome in Fergus's domain, and it was unlikely that either of them
had ever been inside his pantry.
   <p>Knowing that she didn't want to talk to anyone, not even to
Fergus, Diana ran quietly across the hall to the garden-room and
taking the first coat she could find she left the house by the side
door. Clouds obscured what little light there was in the sky, but
Diana knew every path in this part of Kerry and almost blindly she
made her way to the hill above Whitewater Bay. The bay was a quiet
anchorage on a rocky part of coast, but privacy was jealously guarded
by Captain James Wallace who owned the biggest estate in the area, and
no villager from Morne ever went near the little beach.
   <p>Diana didn't know &mdash; and at the moment she didn't care &mdash; if
Captain Wallace had ever seen her on the hillside or not, but she
never did any harm just by sitting on the sheltered side of the big
grey rock below the skyline. The slope in front of her was steep but
it wasn't very far down to the beach where the waves swished gently on
the shingle.
   <p>How long she sat there she never knew, thoughts chasing endlessly
through her mind.
   <p><quote>Sold,</quote> she whispered once. <quote>Sold like a sheep at a Kerry
Fair. But it wasn't my fault &mdash; I've never come up against people like
my aunt and Gregory &mdash; oh, of course it was my own fault, dreaming
of a knight in shining armour and thinking I'd found him in Gregory &mdash;
how funny that is &mdash; Gregory! a new-style Sir Lancelot! &mdash; it's really
terribly funny when you think about it &mdash;</quote>
   <p>And suddenly the laughter which shook her turned to tears and she
rested her cheek against the cold grey rock and cried as she hadn't
done since the death of her father ten years before.
   <p>It was the memory of her father which calmed her at last, and she
sat motionless as she recalled his unfailing light-heartedness even
when the pain of an old war wound racked him; his deep love for her,
and his sorrow that she had never known the mother who had died when
she was an infant; his affection for his wife's beautiful home in
Kerry and for the people of Morne whom he viewed with tolerant and
amused English eyes.
   <p>I'm English really, Diana thought, and it's in England I should
be now and not skulking over here in a neutral country when my own
people are at war with Germany. Or I could go over the border to
Ulster and try to do something useful for a change instead of running
an estate on more money than I'll ever know what to do with.
   <p>Money. Her expression hardened as she thought of the two who
were haggling so shabbily in the Rosebrae drawing-room. Well, they
were going to be disappointed this time. There would be no control of
her inheritance by Gregory, and no twenty thousand pounds for Aunt
Charlotte who no doubt felt she had earned it by introducing the son
of an old love to her niece.
   <p>Diana tensed suddenly as a low murmur of voices reached her and
then she heard the crunch of heavy boots on the stones of the pathway
just above her head. She kept very still as two men passed by, aware
that Miss Diana of Rosebrae &mdash; few people had ever called her Mrs.
West &mdash; would look rather silly if she were found on the Captain's land
with her eyes red and her face all streaked with tears. Gregory
hadn't gone down well with the locals but there was no need to
proclaim her own misery in front of them even if they had proved to be
better judges of a man than she had been.
   <p>She looked cautiously round the edge of the rock beside her and
saw that against the lightening sky the two men stood out fairly
clearly and that they both carried rifles in the crooks of their arms
as they patrolled the little headland.
   <p>Diana frowned. The voices had had a clipped intonation unlike
the soft speech of Kerry, but of course Captain Wallace was a law unto
himself and there was no one to say him nay if he wished to employ
non-local gamekeepers and to have them patrol his bounds after dark.
But such doings were alien to a simple place like Morne, and without
knowing why, Diana was glad that her coat was one she had bought and
worn at school in Paris, a soft grey wool which blended with the rock
against which she was leaning.

<text id=LOBP12>
He realised that she was also wiping her eyes. He hated having to
hurt her, but he had known ever since he had announced his engagement
to Hyacinth, that he would have to talk seriously to his ex-wife. He
had suspected her of wanting to renew their relationship before she
accepted Charles Rawlings, but afterwards he had believed that she had
found happiness with the bluff sailor and he'd been genuinely glad &mdash;
until this holiday in Singapore. Then it had occurred to him that she
had not got over their disastrous marriage.
   <p><quote>I'll &mdash; try and make Charles a good wife,</quote> she said when she
had controlled herself and turned to face him. <quote>He is &mdash; devoted to
me, and I know he will make an excellent husband. I have already told
him about you, and &mdash; and he is prepared to forget it. He believes
that it is possible for two people situated as we are to have a
platonic friendship.</quote>
   <p><quote>And you know that's true, Biddy.</quote>
   <p>She shook her head.
   <p><quote>I don't think that a man and woman who have lived together can
ever be friends; sex is bound to enter into their relationship....
Perhaps you are right.</quote> She made a determined effort to speak
naturally. <quote>It would have been a bad mistake to try and pick up the
threads again. You always were a devil, Nick, and I'm sorry for the
girl you marry, whether she is Hyacinth or &mdash; someone else.</quote>
   <p><quote>If it is not Hyacinth it will be no one,</quote> he assured her.
<quote>But meanwhile, I must find her. If only I had a clue where to look
for her.</quote>
   <p><quote>Has it occurred to you that when you told her about &mdash; us it was
such a shock to her that she has run away.</quote>
   <p><quote>If that had been the case she would have left a letter or a
message, surely?</quote> he protested.
   <p><quote>She might have wanted to punish you; to make you half frantic
on her account, and if so, she has succeeded admirably.</quote>
   <p><quote>I am sure Hyacinth would not be so childish,</quote> he retorted.
   <p><quote>It's just possible that she did leave a letter and it
hasn't been delivered yet,</quote> said Bridget. <quote>What about Tu Kota &mdash;
perhaps he knows what has happened to her?</quote>
   <p><quote>As soon as Charles comes back I'll send for him.</quote>
   <p>The Vice-Admiral returned a few minutes later, his face very
grave.
   <p><quote>Miss Chalmers did leave the hotel last night,</quote> he said.
<quote>She was seen going down the servants' staircase. Those on duty
took her to be a Eurasian sewing maid; she went out very quickly and
spoke to no one. One of the boys who was just going off at the time
saw her walking to the corner of Empress Place, where she got into a
ricksha.</quote>
   <p><quote>Did he notice the number of the ricksha?</quote> asked Nick eagerly.
   <p><quote>He says not.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then &mdash; he probably recognised the coolie who drew it? These
boys know the ricksha coolies by sight. Once we can find the fellow
we shall also find where Hyacinth went. There's no time to be
lost.</quote>
   <p><quote>The boy says that the coolie was a stranger to him; he had
never seen him before. I think he was speaking the truth; there was
no reason for him to lie.</quote>
   <p><quote>Damn!</quote> Nick pounded his clenched fist on the table. <quote>If
only he had kept his eyes open! In which direction did the ricksha
go?</quote>
   <p><quote>He didn't wait to see; there was a great crowd in the streets
last night, owing to the Chinese festival, and it was easy enough to
lose sight of a ricksha. I am afraid, Nick, old fellow, that we shall
have to ask the police to help us, for there has been a very sinister
development.</quote>
   <p><quote>You &mdash; mean...?</quote>
   <p><quote>That Malay boy, Tu Kota, is missing; he, too, didn't sleep in
the hotel last night; he has not been seen since just before midnight,
and he told no one where he was going.</quote>
<head>2</head>
   <p><quote>There you are!</quote> exclaimed Bridget. <quote>Hyacinth was not
alone; granted she's run away, but she took Tu Kota with her; and I
can assure you that she'll be quite safe with him. Don't look at me
like that, Charles, I'd trust that boy anywhere. He is perfectly
reliable. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Hyacinth has returned to
Lipur.</quote>
   <p><quote>But she wouldn't do that. How could she, when your brother is
there alone!</quote>
   <p><quote>Perhaps that's why,</quote> said Bridget, then as both men looked
blank, she cried. <quote>Oh, how stupid you two are! Didn't Edward
propose to her? She may have decided to accept him after all, and
he'll lose no time in marrying her; he won't give her a chance to slip
through his fingers again.</quote>
   <p><quote>We must get in touch with Lipur at once!</quote> cried Nick.
<head>3</head>
   <p>But it was not so easy to get in touch with Lipur; there had been
a heavy storm twenty-four hours previously, and telephonic
communications with the district had been cut, and with Pekama. Nick
managed to get on to the nearest estate and they promised to send a
runner to Lipur with a message for Edward Grampian, and when they
received his reply, telephone it at once to Singapore. Meanwhile,
Charles Rawlings systematically called on all the people Hyacinth had
known, and questioned the officers who had dined with them the
previous night, but none of them had seen Hyacinth, nor could give any
clue to account for her disappearance. It was a complete mystery.
   <p>When the following day had dawned and she had still not returned
and there was no news of her, both the men realised that they must
approach the police. Nick had not slept all night and looked haggard;
he was so restless that he couldn't bear to sit still. Even Bridget
was no longer suggesting that the girl had been caught out in an
escapade; if she had been she'd have been back long ago.
   <p><quote>But there's still a chance that she went to Lipur,</quote> she
insisted. <quote>And you mustn't worry too much, Nick. If Tu Kota is with
her; he'll look after her.</quote>
   <p><quote>The boy who saw her get into the ricksha said she was alone.</quote>
   <p><quote>It may not have been Hyacinth; he couldn't swear to it. It may
really have been one of the Eurasian sewing maids.</quote>
   <p><quote>He said she was wearing a light coat and a gauzy scarf round
her head, and those are two of the articles missing from Hyacinth's
wardrobe.</quote>
   <p><quote>It may be just a coincidence,</quote> said Bridget. <quote>I shouldn't
pin too much faith on that. Wait until we have heard from Lipur.</quote>
   <p>But Charles Rawlings agreed with Nick that they could not afford
to wait, and he offered to go to the police. He knew them and could
impress upon them the need for as little publicity as possible,
though, of course, if publicity would help to find the girl, then they
must employ it.
   <p>The girls and Nick should have returned to the country today, but
with Hyacinth missing, it was unthinkable that they should leave
Singapore. Nick had done everything possible to discover her
whereabouts, but from the moment she had stepped into the ricksha it
was as if the earth had opened and swallowed her.
   <p>He decided to go and make some tactful enquiries in the Chinese
quarter; not that he expected to find Hyacinth there, but someone
might have seen her. Nick himself had many acquaintances in the
Chinese quarter, friends from the war days, and he knew he could rely
on them to do everything possible to help him.
   <p>He was just about to leave the hotel on his quest when one of the
clerks in the reception desk &mdash; a young educated Malay &mdash; came up to
him.
   <p><quote>Mr. Trelawney, sir ... about the young lady....</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> replied Nick, suppressing his eagerness with an effort.
   <p><quote>I have made a discovery, sir. It may be of no account, but I
think that you will find it &mdash; interesting. If we could go up to your
room, sir....</quote>
   <p>Nick wondered if he was about to be touched by a blackmailer, but
the young man sounded genuine enough.
   <p><quote>Very well,</quote> he said. <quote>Come with me now.</quote>
   <p>Once in his room he closed and locked the door, then faced the
Malay.
   <p><quote>What is it?</quote> he asked. <quote>If it's information which will lead
to the finding of Miss Chalmers I'll make it well worth your
while....</quote>
   <p><quote>As I said, sir, it may be of no value, but briefly, I have some
scraps of paper which the boy who cleans her room found in her waste
paper basket. I thought they might be a clue.</quote> He took an envelope
out of his pocket, and emptied a number of twisted scraps of paper on
to the desk in the window. Nick saw that they contained words printed
in block letters, and that some of them had been part of an envelope.
   <p><quote>When were these found?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>Yesterday morning, sir. I was passing when I saw the boy
emptying the waste paper basket, and I gave him a coin to let me have
the contents and not say a word about it to anyone.</quote>
   <p>Nick was already sorting the scraps of paper.
   <p><quote>Have you put them together?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>No sir.</quote> But Nick guessed that the Malay was lying; he had
put them together and then crumpled them up again. He thrust his
hand into his pocket and handed a note to the man.
   <p><quote>Keep your mouth shut, do you understand?</quote>
   <p>Nick gave up all thought of going to the Chinese quarter; he had
glimpsed one significant word, and he was determined to piece the
whole of the scraps together, no matter how long it took him.
   <p>It was over two hours before he had finished, and then he had the
entire message and the envelope.

<quote>
   <p>If Missie Chalmers wishes to know about Mr. Trelawney's
business in Singapore, a ricksha will be waiting at the corner of
Empress Place tonight at midnight, to take her to the lady known as
Chinese Lily. Come veiled and say nothing of this. It concerns
Missie's happiness.
<QUOTE/>

   <p>So that was it! Someone was anxious to break his engagement to
Hyacinth, and had sent her this damnable note which she ought to have
brought straight to him. But she had not done so and had undoubtedly
gone off in the ricksha which had been sent for her; the boy who had
seen her get in it had told the truth. But where had she been taken?
And why hadn't she returned? Who was at the back of all this?
Chinese Lily? He could not think so. He had always regarded her as
his very good friend, though one could never be quite sure when
dealing with an Oriental. It might be that the announcement of his
engagement had roused some dormant demon in her and she'd had Hyacinth
kidnapped. But she had congratulated him and told him she was very
happy for him when he had spoken of his fianc&eacute;e the other night.
   <p>Who else could be at the bottom of this attempt to get hold of
Hyacinth? Attempt, he thought angrily. It was no attempt; it was an
accomplished fact. If the person had just wanted to put her against
him she would have been back by now; the fact that she was missing
assumed a very sinister aspect.
   <p>Chinese Lily was quite capable of having a European girl
kidnapped if she wanted to do so. She was utterly fearless, and had
been too long associated with the underworld not to know exactly how
to set about it. He knew that certain girls who had been in her
employ during the war and had chatted too much to the Japanese had
simply disappeared, and as one girl was as good as another to the
occupying troops &mdash; and if any special man was interested in the girls
in question, Chinese Lily always saw that there were others, even more
attractive &mdash; no awkward questions were asked.

<text id=LOBP13>
This might account for much that puzzled her.
   <p><quote>Mollie, there's no sense in stalling when we both know our own
minds. I've had girls before but never the real thing until now.
I've been waiting for you darling. Thank God I found you in
time...</quote>
   <p>Again the premonition shook her. What did he mean?
   <p><quote>I've been waiting for you too,</quote> she said shyly. <quote>It's so
simple really, isn't it?</quote>
   <p>Either you were one of the lucky ones and met your fate, or you
weren't &mdash; and didn't. The world was a different place because she and
Nigel had met. She drew a steadying breath, realising how near they
had come to missing each other. If he'd gone to America they might
never have met. Somewhere across the world he would have roamed about
seeking her &mdash; while she would have stayed home, doing the job nearest
to her, but empty and unhappy. The thought brought the misty feeling
back to her eyes. They were lucky.
   <p><quote>You feel as I do, so it couldn't be better,</quote> he whispered.
<quote>Let's get out of here when I can do more than talk.</quote>
   <p>Mollie followed him, bemused with happiness. She moved on a
cloud, floating effortlessly out to the car. They got in without a
word, and he drove on, careless of direction, intent only on getting
her alone.
   <p><quote>Now.</quote> He slammed on the brake, drew into a lay-by.
<quote>Darling girl...</quote>
   <p>They were in a leafy lane, hedges high about them, the evening
closing in slowly. It had not rained after all. She turned to him,
her face showing her love and understanding.
   <p><quote>Nigel &mdash; I love you.</quote>
   <p><quote>I know. I feel it here.</quote> He touched his broad chest, before
drawing her into his arms. She trembled at his touch, realising his
complete domination over her will. She had read of such things
happening to others, but this was her first experience and she was
unafraid. His cheek rested against hers, he held her close, and for
the moment was content.
   <p><quote>I love you. Thank God I found you in time.</quote>
   <p>She touched his face gently with her lips. <quote>It's wonderful. I
didn't know it would be like this.</quote>
   <p><quote>I did &mdash; with the right girl. We must be married at once,
Mollie. I can't stand anything else. You must agree.</quote>
   <p>Could any promise made before this moment really count? She
subdued the rising uneasiness, wanting to promise Nigel anything he
demanded.
   <p>As if he read her thoughts he said: <quote>Your guardians haven't a
hope of holding you to a promise made before we met. I'll talk them
round. They can't withhold permission once we're determined.</quote>
   <p>She laughed softly against his ear. <quote>It's remotely possible
that they won't be swept off their feet as I have been...</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll make a fight for it, won't you?</quote> The words were an
intimate whisper, and seemed to carry them forward more than anything
yet.
   <p><quote>Yes. Oh, I will. I will.</quote>
   <p><quote>I want us to belong from the first possible moment.</quote>
   <p><quote>So do I.</quote> She wondered at herself, but no other answer
was possible. <quote>I'm spineless &mdash; I'd no idea it took one this
way.</quote> Perhaps it wasn't always so. Perhaps other men were not as
fascinating as Nigel, with his Viking appeal. She studied him
quietly, seeing the strength in his face, that backed his
handsomeness.
   <p>He began to kiss her mouth, deliberately trying to rouse her,
experiencing the first thrill of her being as she responded. He was
quick to follow this with a more intimate embrace.
   <p><quote>I'm the first,</quote> he mused against her soft lips. <quote>The very
first. I can tell &mdash; and I'm glad. I wanted to be first &mdash; with the
one woman. You've never been kissed before.</quote>
   <p><quote>Not this way. Just cousins and things.</quote>
   <p><quote>Things?</quote> He pretended a brief jealousy.
   <p><quote>Games &mdash; relatives &mdash; and things...</quote>
   <p><quote>Not one of them kissed you so &mdash; and so &mdash; and so...</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote> She breathed lightly, because it seemed impossible to
draw a long breath. <quote>Oh, please, Nigel...</quote> His increasing passion
was almost more than she could bear just then, yet she wanted to
respond, to be to him what he obviously wanted her to be. In the
confines of the little car it was difficult to cast off a feeling of
apprehension. She grew tense, wishing she had more experience. When
was it time to call a halt? Perhaps it was all new to him, also, so
she must go carefully. Her last wish was to hurt him, or to harm this
wonderful feeling they shared. <quote>You &mdash; you are going too fast for me,
Nigel.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't you like me to hold you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, but...</quote>
   <p><quote>You'll get used to it, adorable baby. I'm glad you're not
ready with all the answers. I always hoped for a girl like you. Most
of them drive a chap too far.</quote>
   <p>She realised that in spite of his words, he did place a brake on
himself in some way and she felt considerably relieved. He leaned
away, considering her, his eyes teasing. She felt shy again, gauche
and young.
   <p><quote>You'll have to make an honest man of me soon, darling. Let's
make plans. Definitely before I go to America! We both want
that.</quote>
   <p><quote>I may not be able to travel with you.</quote>
   <p><quote>I can scarcely bear to leave you behind even for a few
weeks.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're too impatient. Let's just be engaged for a few
months.</quote> It would be so pleasant knowing that he loved her and was
waiting for her, and they would have time to make a proper start to
their life together.
   <p><quote>No. That's not enough. You know it too, but I forgive you
because you don't realise what it means to me. We must be married,
Mollie.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well &mdash; won't it be worse if we're married &mdash; and then I can't
get out to you for months? There is all the business of the passport,
and visa, you know what it's like.</quote>
   <p><quote>I could fly back every weekend.</quote>
   <p>She laughed shakenly. <quote>You're in love.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I am in love; be gentle with me, sweet Mollie.</quote>
   <p>The appeal touched her heart. He drew her back into his embrace.
She knew then that he was too big a man to conceal his feelings from
her. His simplicity sprang from his strength of character, and was
not weakness as she had first thought.
   <p><quote>You will come to see the family at the weekend. I'll make all
necessary plans. They'll know I mean to marry you.</quote>
   <p><quote>They may feel that I'm unsuitable.</quote>
   <p><quote>It doesn't matter. It's what I want that counts now. I'm not
a boy.</quote>
   <p><quote>You must meet my guardians too,</quote> she whispered.
   <p><quote>If that's what you want me to do, but it doesn't make any
difference. I'll raise heaven and earth to get you. We've time if I
start moving tomorrow. We'll treat the trip to America as a
honeymoon.</quote>
   <p><quote>I should have thought that in this scientific age you'd be
flying to America?</quote>
   <p><quote>No. My chief is doing so, but I'm taking out some special gear
that we'll need over there. I must see to the loading and unloading,
for some of the instruments are fantastically sensitive. Whether we
reach the moon or not depends entirely on my efforts &mdash; alone and
unaided!</quote> He laughed at her crestfallen expression. <quote>I love to
tease you darling. Actually I'll manage so much better with you
along.</quote>
   <p><quote>I hope it's the right thing to do. Could it be a stumbling
block in your career later on?</quote>
   <p><quote>Our marriage? No... but you may rue the day you ever met
me.</quote>
   <p>She put both hands to his face. <quote>I'll never do that, Nigel.
I'll always understand. Men have jobs that take them out of a
woman's sphere sometimes. I'll not be jealous of your work. At least
I hope I won't.</quote>
   <p>They sat for an hour, bemused by their happiness, feeling that
all things were possible. The tremendous difficulties ahead began to
dissolve beneath their sanguine hopes. Night was closing in when
Nigel thrust both hands through his thick hair and sat erect. He
pressed the self-starter grimly.
   <p><quote>We'll call it a day. I must see Terence tonight and tell him
our news. I must also be in London before breakfast. Don't forget
your promise to spend next weekend with me at home.</quote>
   <p>She sat back, knowing that he was leading and she must follow.
She felt depressed when she remembered the promise made to her
guardians. Would they understand that this feeling for Nigel was
something she had not foreseen?
   <p><quote>Are you regretting anything?</quote> Nigel said, as he drew up in
front of the stone steps leading to the main hall of the college.
<quote>Wait &mdash; we didn't say goodbye.</quote> It was a stormy, protracted
farewell, which bewildered her. Nothing could possibly be as
important as this. He opened the car door for her, following quickly
on to the steps. <quote>I'll see you in, darling.</quote>
   <p><quote>It really isn't necessary...</quote> Yet it was comforting to know
herself protected. She went up the steps ahead of him. The door
opened before they reached it.
   <p>Terence stood looking down at them. His expression was cold,
utterly unreadable. He was not in the least like Nigel then. He was
wearing a navy double-breasted suit and looked formal and stiff to
her. Some of the stiffness was in his bearing, and she realised in
surprise that he was angry &mdash; very angry. For an instant she
hesitated. She felt that Nigel was momentarily startled too. They'd
both forgotten about Terence.
   <p><quote>So there you are.</quote> Terence spoke first, through set lips.
<quote>I might have known you'd be together. You could have given me a
hint, Nigel.</quote>
   <p><quote>None of your business &mdash; was it?</quote> Nigel said.
   <p>Mollie glanced from one to the other in keen dismay. It was to
Terence that she made her appeal. Why was he so angry? <quote>Please,
Terence...</quote>
   <p>His cold smile did not reach his eyes. <quote>All right.</quote>
   <p>She looked back at Nigel, seeing his mocking smile as if he
appreciated Terence's temper. There was a tiny silence, which she did
not try to break.
   <p><quote>Now you're here you can give me a lift back, Nigel.</quote> Terence
was trying to recover lost ground, but finding it difficult.
   <p>Mollie was so unprepared for this open antagonism between the two
men that she did not know how to cope. Dismay held her silent and
uncomfortable. Had they quarrelled earlier in the day? She thought
Terence looked white and wondered why he was there, as if awaiting
them.
   <p><quote>Don't be in such a hurry to push me off,</quote> Nigel drawled as if
amused. <quote>It may interest you to know that Mollie and I are engaged &mdash;
we'll make it official as from next weekend. We are to be married as
soon after that as I can manage it &mdash; any objections, old man?</quote>
   <p>The silence was quite terrifying to Mollie as she looked up at
Terence. What was wrong? She had not known either of them long
enough to guess at the source of the trouble, and she had certainly
not been guilty of flirting with either of them.
   <p>Terence made an effort to answer the challenge. He was a more
slender man than Nigel, but still stood about six feet tall. He felt
mechanically in his pocket for a cigarette, and they waited as he
lighted it.
   <p><quote>Congratulations,</quote> he said, puffing out a cloud of smoke.
   <p>Nigel grinned and waved a hand in an airy salute, evidently
knowing that he could not at that moment expect more from his brother.
<quote>Thank you.</quote>
   <p>Had Terence expected this would happen, and had tried to save his
brother from committing himself? Nigel had hinted that she was not
the first girl in his life, and she realised with a fresh pang that he
had seemed thoroughly experienced in the way he'd tried to rouse her.
   <p><quote>Aren't you going to kiss your future sister-in-law?</quote> Nigel
said.
   <p><quote>I'll claim that privilege on the wedding day.</quote> Terence
turned away.
   <p>Nigel stared hard at him, not too pleased, but for once bereft of
words.

<text id=LOBP14>
   <p>Lois did so, deftly removed her scarf and gloves and followed
her friend into the house. Bertie and Robert were in the living-room
which, despite the bright fire, had a cold, unused appearance, natural
enough considering that Bertie preferred the kitchen and Joan was
always too busy to sit down anywhere.
   <p>Lois's arrival seemed to warm and enliven the atmosphere, and, as
Joan had predicted, there were no gaps in the conversation. She was
not in the least self-conscious and so obviously bubbling over with
youthful high spirits that the two men could be almost seen to
thaw in her presence. Before she came, there had been a slight
stiffness, due chiefly to the fact that they were practically
strangers with little in common.
   <p>Joan brought in tea, tiny, diamond-shaped sandwiches and cake.
Waiting on the others, she was a little hurt by their attitude.
Bertie, as usual, expected to have everything done for him and
Robert's attention was given to Lois. Every now and then he would
turn to Joan, including her in the conversation, but she could not
help feeling that he regarded her as a mere child, the little girl who
had been the Rose Queen &mdash; even though he had forgotten her! Whereas,
he treated Lois in a subtly different manner. More like a woman,
thought Joan, though she was three years younger than herself. It
must always be like that, she supposed. The pretty ones got
everything! And Lois was essentially feminine, although it would have
been unfair to dismiss her as a mere flirt. She was interested in
men, her looks and manner aroused their interest. <squote>And I,</squote> thought
Joan, <squote>am interested only in Robert. As for my looks, they don't
amount to a row of pins in contrast with what Lois has to offer.</squote>
   <p>After tea, they sat round the fire. When Bertie had visualised
Joan taking Robert on a tour of the property, he had forgotten how
short the afternoons were. Darkness was already gathering, and when
it became necessary for Joan to excuse herself in order to feed the
hens, there was still no chance for him to be alone with Lois. Robert
was left to play third whether he liked it or not. Apparently he did.
He and Lois were getting on splendidly together.
   <p><quote>I thought you were a hermit, Mr. Hepworth. Joan says you've
been away, but I pictured you shut up at Silverstone, the windows
shuttered, the tradesmen leaving just enough food outside the back
door.</quote>
   <p>Robert looked at her with amusement. <quote>Are you disappointed?</quote>
   <p><quote>Quite the reverse, but I do wish you were married.</quote>
   <p>Robert laughed outright. <quote>You're a bit young to be a
match-maker. It's a favourite hobby of those who can't &mdash; well, match
themselves!</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, I don't bother about most people, but if you had a
wife, it would be such fun. She would be living in the largest house
for miles, and she'd give lovely parties and everything would be gay.
Larchwood is a bit flat, you know. My stepmother plays bridge and
that's awful. You should see their faces, as solemn as if they were
at a funeral and if you dare interrupt they chop your head off. There
are the church bazaars, too, and outings and amateur theatricals and
the Women's Institute, but nothing can be compared to the parties your
wife would give.</quote>
   <p>Bertie was frowning at her, afraid that Robert would imagine she
was giving him too broad a hint. It was a bit much the way she
was carrying on, he reflected. Of course, she was so sweet and
innocent she didn't realise she might be giving a false impression.
   <p><quote>Lois works at Mrs. Harris's Dress Shop in Waverley,</quote> he
told Robert. <quote>I expect she's thinking how good it would be for trade
if there was a touch more social life here. She's gifted at her
job.</quote>
   <p>He glanced at her with pride, glad to show her in a different
light from the one produced by her own scatter-brained chatter.
   <p>Lois threw up her pretty little soft hands in a gesture of
protest.
   <p><quote>You ought to hear Mrs. Harris's opinion of me! The things I
forget! The things I don't do! She'd have fired me long ago if it
wasn't for my figure. I can model clothes, you see. She has to admit
they look better on me than on any of the other girls, and that makes
the customers more inclined to give an order.</quote>
   <p>Feeling a trifle out of his depth, Robert said: <quote>Do you like
your job, Miss Wade?</quote>
   <p><quote>I would if the clothes were real.</quote>
   <p>Robert floundered deeper than ever, and, seeing his expression of
bewilderment, she added: <quote>Mrs. Harris has to please her customers
and they're mostly farmers' wives or just the locals. Not that she
could fly higher. She hasn't got it in her. But, if I never marry, I
shall try to get a job in London, modelling. I get fed up with
ordinary clothes, garments. I'd like a real creation.</quote>
   <p>Her eyes were large and dreamy as if gazing upon some celestial
vision. How odd women were, thought Robert, amazed at her reverence
for what he considered so trivial. Bertie, however, pounced on one
sentence of hers.
   <p><quote>How d'you mean if you never marry? Of course you'll marry.
There isn't any never about it.</quote>
   <p>At this moment, Joan re-entered the room. Tom had managed to
escape having to accompany his wife to evening service, and, in what
Joan considered a most touching way, had insisted on finishing all the
final chores.
   <p><quote>You run along and enjoy yourself with your friends, Miss
Sutton. It's not often you get the chance of wearing a nice red dress
instead of your old blue trousers. Apron over it's all right with
chicken, but, with the old sow there's bound to be trouble. Rub
herself against you as likely as not, and then where will you be?</quote>
   <p><quote>Rolling in the mud, I expect, Tom,</quote> she responded,
laughingly.
   <p><quote>That's egg-zactly what I meant. You go indoors and keep
yourself nice and clean for once.</quote>
   <p>Obeying him thankfully, Joan slung her apron on to a peg, shed
her rubber boots in favour of high-heeled black shoes and combed her
hair in front of the small mirror in the kitchen.
   <p>A nice red dress, Tom had said. Probably that was how it looked
in his eyes, and she had herself chosen to wear it in preference to
her blue woollen or the tweeds, believing, hoping &mdash; even though rather
shamefacedly &mdash; that Robert would notice her and think she was pretty.
The blue suited her better, bringing out the colour of her eyes, but
she knew she must do something to distinguish herself if possible.
Lois was so fascinating that whether she wished it or not she was
always a powerful rival. The deep red colour of this dress would
surely procure its wearer a little attention.
   <p>During tea, however, Joan realised that she might just as well
have worn her ancient corduroy trousers, or swathed herself in a red
blanket! There wasn't a man in the world who would have given her a
second glance while Lois was in the room. She heaved a sigh, then
laughed at herself for being so silly and self-pitying. It was her
own fault for inviting Robert on a day when Lois would be there, and,
instead of standing about, feeling sorry for herself, she ought to be
doing something to help poor Bertie. He must be itching to get rid of
the other man.
   <p>Entering the living-room, Joan put forward the first excuse she
could think of to ensure that her brother might have his coveted few
minutes alone with the girl he loved.
   <p><quote>Mr. Hepworth &mdash; I mean Robert &mdash; I wonder if you'd mind coming
upstairs to look at a damp patch we've got. I thought &mdash; while you're
here...</quote>
   <p>He rose at once, but she saw the surprise he could not altogether
hide. Although technically the owner, his father's old bailiff
performed all that was necessary from a landlord.
   <p>He followed Joan up to the next floor, without comment.
Meanwhile, she was racking her brains for a means of delaying him,
and, at the same time, was wondering where to take him. There were
three bedrooms, Bertie's, the one where she slept and which had
formerly belonged to Uncle Greg, and a tiny spare room, kept sacred
for the infrequent visitor. Avoiding all these, she led him up the
remaining few stairs to the loft, flicking on lights as she went.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry to take you away from the fire.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm not a hot-house plant, I shan't wither. Where's the damp
you mentioned?</quote>
   <p>Joan glanced wildly about her. There was an old couch whose
upholstery needed repairing, two tin trunks, a large lithograph of
Canterbury Cathedral in a hideous frame and some cardboard boxes. The
walls were white-washed and the ceiling innocent of any stain.
   <p>Blushing scarlet, she stammered: <quote>There isn't any d-damp.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then why the blazes did you say there was?</quote>
   <p><quote>I &mdash; I just wanted &mdash; people sometimes like to be alone
together &mdash; please try to understand.</quote>
   <p>Raising her eyes to his, she saw that he was looking at her with
an expression of contempt.
   <p><quote>I believe I do understand,</quote> he said. <quote>Well, if you really
want it, you can have it.</quote>
   <p>Before she realised what he meant, he caught her by the
shoulders, drawing her towards him. She had an instant's glimpse of
grey eyes, hard as steel, then his lips were on hers.
   <p>For one fleeting second, her senses reeled and a sweet thrill ran
through every nerve. Then she had wrenched herself free, her cheeks
burning, her eyes bright with unshed angry tears.
   <p><quote>How dare you!</quote> she gasped.
   <p><quote>Very easily. You've never taken your eyes off me the whole
afternoon, yesterday you managed to fling yourself into my arms &mdash; I
thought it was an accident at the time, I admit, but in face of this,
I'm not so sure.</quote>
   <p><quote>You conceited idiot!</quote> exclaimed Joan, furiously.
   <p><quote>No, I don't flatter myself it's my superior charms which turned
your head. I can imagine how bored you must get here, but you
shouldn't play with fire, you might get the wrong man.</quote>
   <p><quote>I have,</quote> she retorted. <quote>I don't know anyone who could have
behaved so abominably. It was an accident yesterday, I fell over
my shopping bag.</quote>
   <p><quote>At the very moment when I happened to be there to catch you. I
suppose you'll tell me next that staring at me all afternoon was
merely the natural anxiety of a hostess waiting to pour out the second
cup of tea.</quote> Robert was speaking as unkindly as he could, driven to
it by a frightful suspicion that he had made an unforgivable mistake.
<quote>If you're so innocent,</quote> he went on, <quote>show me the damp patch on
the wall &mdash; or would you prefer me to search the ceiling?</quote>
   <p>Joan positively stamped her foot with rage. <quote>There isn't a damp
patch. It was an excuse to get you out of the room.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ah, now we're getting at the truth,</quote> he interposed,
sarcastically.
   <p><quote>Will you listen to me and stop interrupting! The reason
why I wanted to take you away from the others is that my brother's in
love with Lois. He never gets a chance of being alone with her and I
thought &mdash; oh, never mind, you'd never understand. Think what you like
of me. Why should I care? You're only a stranger. Besides, I've
done what I wanted to. They are alone together.</quote>
   <p>She spoke with an air of triumph which had very little to do with
her true feelings. For one dreadful moment she had longed to slap his
face, just as hard as she possibly could. Now, all she wanted was to
drop on to the beastly old broken couch in the corner and sob her
heart out.
   <p>Robert spoke apologetically.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry. I've made an appalling mistake, I see that now.</quote>
   <p><quote>Sorry!</quote> she repeated, derisively.

<text id=LOBP15>
   <p>We were on a stretch of straight road, climbing up towards the
Heights, and he risked taking his eyes from the road for a second to
look fully at me. I couldn't read anything from his face. Apart from
a certain gravity there was nothing in it but the impersonal scrutiny
that belonged to his vocation. He let another car overtake him before
he spoke.
   <p><quote>Still speaking from a professional point of view,</quote> he said,
<quote>I would strongly advise you to pay a visit to your doctor in the
very near future.</quote>
   <p>I didn't answer him until we had reached the row of cottages that
nestled in a hollow underneath the final ascent to the Heights. He
drew the car to a stop on the green in front of the last one in the
row and was in the act of getting out when I said quietly, <quote>You're a
doctor.</quote>
   <p>He reached over into the back and lifted out his bag.
   <p><quote>But not yours, Mrs. Landry. I attend only to the lower
members of your household.</quote>
   <p>He said it quite without rancour, and I was positive none was
intended. <quote>But you could be mine,</quote> I insisted.
   <p>He inclined his head. <quote>I could, yes. But I would advise you to
see your own man, one who knows and understands you.</quote> He shut the
door and leaned down through the window to ask, <quote>Are you coming in,
Mrs. Landry?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote> I shook my head. <quote>No &mdash; I'd rather not.</quote>
   <p><quote>As you wish. I may be a little while in here. You've time to
climb up to the Heights if you feel like it. The view is well worth
the scramble if you haven't seen it before.</quote>
   <p>I waited until he had disappeared into the cottage before I got
out and started up the path that wound its way up behind the row of
houses. I had been there before and I wasn't particularly interested
in the view. It was the old restlessness that drove me on once I
found myself alone, away from the calming influence of his presence.
   <p>I was panting by the time I got to the top and sank on to a small
outcrop of rock. I got my cigarette case out with a certain amount of
defiance and watched the blue smoke drift lazily away on the still
air.
   <p>The view was a magnificent one even in the distant haze of the
November morning. The sun caught and sparkled on the river as it
wound its leisurely way far below. Bare of leaves, the wooded
hillside had a stark beauty, and the fields still held practically the
fresh greenness of midsummer.
   <p>I was sitting there, lost to time, when I heard the foot-steps
behind me and turned to see Dr. Broderick clambering over the uneven
ground. I jumped up in quick remorse.
   <p><quote>Oh, I'm sorry &mdash; I've kept you waiting,</quote> I said hurriedly, but
he waved me back on to my rock.
   <p><quote>There's no hurry,</quote> he said. <quote>I guessed you'd be up here. I
often come up myself when I'm out this way.</quote>
   <p>He sank on to the rock next to me. I noticed that he was not in
the least exerted by the rather stiff climb. His breath came evenly.
   <p>And, strangely, I felt a return of that calmness. I sat there
quietly with him, waiting. I had the feeling that he was waiting,
too &mdash; serenely patient.
   <p>But it was a long time before I spoke. He hadn't invited my
confidence &mdash; rather he seemed to have gone out of his way, a little
earlier, to reject it. He might not like me but I felt that he would
listen, and that he would have an understanding I could never expect
from Charles.
   <p>And so I said at last, <quote>I think I'm losing my reason, Dr.
Broderick.</quote>
   <p>He gave me no more than a casual glance.
   <p><quote>And what makes you think that?</quote> he asked calmly. <quote>As a
rule, a person who is becoming mentally unhinged is the very last to
suspect anything is wrong.</quote>
   <p><quote>But I can't remember who I am,</quote> I said, wretchedly. <quote>I know
that I must be Lisa Landry, and that Charles is my husband and Joanna
my daughter &mdash; but I don't know them. I don't know anyone with whom I
come in contact &mdash; the servants, our neighbours &mdash; I didn't know you
the other day &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Just a minute, Mrs. Landry,</quote> he broke in gently. <quote>Loss of
memory is a very common occurrence. There are many factors that can
contribute to its cause. You mustn't worry that you're losing your
reason because you're suffering from a temporary amnesia &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>But it's more than that. Don't you see? I have a memory &mdash;
but it isn't the right one.</quote>
   <p><quote>What do you mean by that?</quote>
   <p>I asked him then the question I had wanted to ask the vicar, that
man of God. The question I had been too afraid to ask myself in the
darkness of the unsleeping night.
   <p>I asked it unflinchingly, out of the stillness which had
descended suddenly upon us.
   <p><quote>Do you believe, Dr. Broderick, that the soul of a girl who
has been dead nearly sixteen years could inhabit and take possession
of a complete stranger?</quote>
<head>7</head>
   <p>THERE was a bird singing in a tree near at hand. I couldn't
see it but the high, sweet notes of its song held a plaintive,
appealing sadness. The faint whirring of some distant machinery
reached us clearly, a dull monotonous sound. When Dr. Broderick
moved his foot suddenly I jumped nervously.
   <p>He had sat quietly, not looking at me, his face quite inscrutable
so that I had no means of knowing what he was thinking. When he spoke
at last he sounded oddly helpless in his hesitation.
   <p><quote>My dear girl &mdash; I don't profess to know anything about the
spiritual body &mdash; only the physical one. A clergyman would be better
equipped than I am to answer such a question. But tell me why you ask
it?</quote>
   <p>I took a deep breath and faced him fully.
   <p><quote>Because that's what I think has happened to me. If it hasn't &mdash;
then I know I am mad.</quote> I gave a little mirthless laugh. <quote>Take
your choice, Dr. Broderick, which would you rather be if you were
me &mdash; possessed or insane?</quote>
   <p><quote>What makes you think you are either?</quote>
   <p><quote>There's nothing else I can think &mdash; when the only life I know is
that of a girl who has been dead more than fifteen years.</quote>
   <p>I took the cigarette he offered, drawing at it raggedly. I gave
him a quick, nervous glance but he wasn't looking at me. He was
gazing out across the wooded stretch beneath us. I knew that he was
waiting for me to go on but wouldn't hurry me, that his calmness
didn't mean that he was disinterested.
   <p>I started to tell him about Dorcas Mallory. I began with abrupt,
sometimes not quite coherent sentences, but presently beneath the
soothing influence of his quiet attention I went on more fluently.
   <p>I told him about her adoption when she was a child &mdash; no more than
three years old &mdash; so that there was no memory of a previous life
before that with the Mallorys. There was only a vague recollection,
too, of the new mother who had died not much more than a year later.
But the memory of the life with Adrian Mallory was clear. I told him
of her childhood in the house, High Towers &mdash; a lonely childhood,
perhaps, but a happy one, with dear old Henrietta and the kindly
Mrs. Bakewell. I told him of small, uninteresting incidents that
only Dorcas Mallory could have known; those trivial, everyday
occurrences that mean nothing to anyone other than the person they
happened to. I evoked memories of old Henrietta who probably hadn't
been as old as she seemed at that time to the young Dorcas &mdash; of her
warm motherliness and her fragrance of lavender; of Adrian Mallory,
his shyness and his gentle kindness, and as I talked about him I think
I realized for the first time that I would never see him again &mdash; that
perhaps I had never known him, for how could I have done so? I know
that I talked of him with a sadness that went deep inside me.
   <p>I recalled Dorcas Mallory's schooldays &mdash; rather lonely schooldays
with not many close friends because the reserve that was in Adrian
Mallory was in Dorcas, too. But she had not particularly felt the
loneliness and the holidays had been happy ones &mdash; spent mostly at
home, at first because of her father's reluctance to travel and then
because the war made travelling impracticable.
   <p>When I told him about Russ I found it difficult to speak
impersonally. There was so much that I couldn't put into words, not
even to someone as understanding as Dr. Broderick. How could I
possibly describe to anyone the love between Russell Winslow and
Dorcas Mallory? My voice broke when I finally told him of the wedding
that never took place, of the journey to London of Dorcas and Adrian
Mallory, of the happiness of that girl on the eve of her marriage.
   <p>I sat silent at last, my head bent, watching the slight breeze
lazily stirring a curled brown leaf at my feet. It rustled faintly as
it moved, and then a sharper breath of wind caught it and hurried it
away.
   <p>Dr. Broderick said gently, <quote>What then?</quote>
   <p>I looked up, somehow startled that he had been unable to follow
the wistful trend of my mind. <quote>What then?</quote> I repeated, and then,
keeping my voice as steady and expressionless as I could, <quote>Dorcas
and her father were killed in an air raid. There was no wedding.
They both died that night.</quote>
   <p><quote>This girl you have been telling me about &mdash; she is the
one...?</quote> He paused uncertainly. I think his logical mind found it
difficult to put my fantastic supposition into words. I waited to see
if he would continue.
   <p>When he didn't, I said, <quote>I woke up on the day of Joanna's
wedding thinking that it was my wedding day. I didn't know where
I was, or why, but the events I have been telling you about &mdash; that
evening in London &mdash; were so clear to me that I thought it was still
April, 1944. I took up Dorcas Mallory's life exactly at the point
where she died.</quote> He stirred slightly as though he would have
interrupted but I went on, <quote>I can't tell you a single thing about
Lisa Landry's life prior to that morning in August, but I can tell you
all about Dorcas Mallory. I can tell you of these things that no
one &mdash; not even Charles &mdash; could have told me. I am Lisa Landry &mdash; but
my mind is Dorcas Mallory.</quote>
   <p>He said, <quote>Charles &mdash; your husband?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why do you say &mdash; that even Charles could not have told you?
How could he know anything at all &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Charles and Adrian Mallory were stepbrothers,</quote> I said. <quote>I &mdash;
Dorcas never saw him until a few weeks before &mdash; before she died. He
spent most of his time in Canada.</quote>
   <p><quote>Did you know this girl?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p><quote>But you probably heard your husband talk about her?</quote>
   <p><quote>He never really knew her.</quote> I said it defensively, but
against what I wasn't quite sure. <quote>I told you &mdash; Dorcas never met him
until a few weeks before she was killed. And then she barely knew
him &mdash; they only met a very few times. Charles couldn't possibly know
all the things I have told you about her.</quote>
   <p><quote>He could know a good deal of it,</quote> he said gently. <quote>And some
of the things... Are you quite sure that you know these things,
or could you have imagined them?</quote>
   <p><quote>No!</quote> I said it with a sense of outrage. <quote>No one could
possibly imagine everything I know about Dorcas Mallory &mdash; every
detail of her life &mdash; every incident, day by day. And Russ...</quote>
   <p><quote>The man Dorcas was to marry?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes &mdash; I knew him immediately I saw him. How could I have
recognized a man I have never met?</quote>

<text id=LOBP16>
Yes, he would see Mackinnon and see if he could get anything out of
him. For Jane's sake he would have to know. So that this could be
stopped before it was too late &mdash; if it was not too late already. To
his surprise he found himself hoping that there was nothing dreadful
to discover. For Jane's sake, of course. She would be hurt. And he
did not want her hurt. And young Grant &mdash; damn it, he had almost liked
him the other night. And he could not help admiring him, for his guts
in tackling the job he was tackling.
   <p>But Alison, who, after all had brought up four daughters, seemed
to think it would all fade out. And Elizabeth had some plans...
   <p><quote>You'll be starting counting days to your holiday soon, Jane,</quote>
he said cheerfully.
   <p>Jane smiled but did not answer. If she counted days it would be
for a reason contrary to what the General thought. She gave him half
her attention as he went on talking about what Elizabeth had said in
her last letter, conjecturing about when they would see Susan again.
She was thinking of how she would tell Neil what her father had said
about his parents, seeing the look of relief which would come into his
dark eyes when he knew his aunt's disparaging remarks had had no
foundation in fact. How glad she was that Neil could now look back to
his young parents with affection, untouched by fear. How glad she was
that they had decided to recreate that flower garden which Angus
seemed to think had been created by Neil's mother.
   <p><quote>Father, I'm going to ask you for a heap of cuttings in the
autumn. There's a wide strip of land at Dalnadoire which Angus says
was once a garden. So we &mdash;</quote> she coloured and changed it, <quote>so Neil
is going to start it again. I've said we'd give him lots of
plants.</quote>
   <p><quote>Plants! Plenty of those, Jane.</quote> Here the General was in his
element. <quote>Come out when you've finished, and we'll mark what you
want. Best to do that when they're flowering.</quote> He got up stiffly
out of his chair. <quote>There's that new delphinium I put in last autumn.
Coming out now. Grand colour. You'd like it in the background,
Jane. And it's growing so well that it will split. Come out and look
at it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. I'll just get rid of these.</quote> She got up from the
table, stacking dishes, and smiled to herself as she ran between the
dining-room and the kitchen. Once they got to know Neil they would be
sure to like him. She would just need to have patience.
   <p>The next three weeks went by with what seemed to be an
astonishing rapidity. Jane had had little enthusiasm for her holiday
at the beginning, but now she had even less. To have to exchange,
even for a fortnight, the warm happiness of being with Neil, of
sharing with him their growing love, of watching how everything was
progressing at the farm she was coming to love as much as he did, for
Elizabeth and her lectures, for spells of baby-sitting, and keeping at
arm's length the rather callow young men whom Elizabeth seemed to
know, was far from pleasing. But she could see no way to get out of
it. Her mother was constantly talking of it, enlarging on the
supposed pleasures in store, expecting from her an enthusiasm which
Jane could not produce.
   <p>That Lady Rose was thinking more of getting Jane away from
Drumlairig than of her having an enjoyable holiday, Jane was well
aware. General Rose might be starting to think more kindly of Neil,
be beginning to take an interest in him and his doings, to see in him
something to admire, but her mother was not. To her Neil Grant was
still someone of so little account that he could be completely
ignored. It almost seemed that she was completely unaware of her
daughter's friendship with him.
   <p>But, despite that, for Jane those weeks were happy ones. Neil
was still working hard, indeed seemed to be working even harder.
There was so much to be done and everything had to be done in a
manner conforming to the high standard he had set himself. Dalnadoire
was beginning to look like a well-kept, prosperous farm, the old house
was being gradually cleaned and painted.
   <p>Jane watched progress with eager, loving eyes, was there to give
praise and encouragement.
   <p>The weather was fine, the days were hot, but one morning Jane,
rising early as usual, looked out of her window to see that the trees
and the chimneys were almost blotted out by mist. There was not a
mountain to be seen and there was a stillness over everything. Was
this the first sign that autumn was coming? Surely it was still too
early in the year for that, but everything was early this year. But
whatever it was it was a disagreeable morning, and she would need to
get away quickly for it would take her much longer to walk that mile
to the station with visibility a mere ten yards.
   <p>Shrouded in a mackintosh, shivering a little in the damp still
air, she hurried down the drive. It felt as if she were alone in the
world. Apart from the never ceasing swishing and pounding of the
river, there was not a movement, not a sound. And then a dog barked,
another joined in excitedly, and two small forms ran eagerly towards
her.
   <p><quote>Why Rory! Gill! What are you doing here?</quote> she exclaimed and
looked beyond them, as a man's figure loomed out of the mist.
   <p><quote>Morning, Jane,</quote> Neil was greeting her cheerfully. <quote>Want a
lift?</quote> He put an arm about her shoulders, smiling at her surprised
face. <quote>Not the sort of morning for a walk. Here's the car.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why, Neil! I never expected to see you. Are you going to the
station?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote> He had the door of the car opened. <quote>In you get.</quote>
   <p>She got in, the puppies scrambled in after her and she let them
jump eagerly on to her lap as Neil went round to the driver's seat.
   <p><quote>Have you something to collect, Neil?</quote>
   <p>He shook his head as he started the engine and they moved off.
<quote>I want to see you get safely there,</quote> he said quietly.
   <p><quote>You mean &mdash; you've come especially to take me?</quote>
   <p>He smiled. <quote>You don't think I was going to have you walking
that lonely road on a morning like this?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, Neil!</quote> she murmured and felt wonderful. And when in a
few minutes they reached the station, she leaned over, put her hands
on his shoulders and kissed him on the mouth, not caring at all that a
smiling Willie MacIntyre was an interested spectator.
   <p>There were many other small incidents to show Jane what she was
to Neil, to make her feel warm and rich and essential. On the
Tuesdays when she met him in Inverness for lunch, they usually managed
to have a little time left after their meal was over. At first they
had walked along the river to the islands, or climbed the hill to the
castle, looking at the statue of Flora MacDonald, at the view westward
at which she gazed. But latterly they had spent their time among the
shops. Window shopping, Jane said. Nor did they restrict their
window gazing to the books which delighted them both.
   <p>It was the week before Jane was due to go on holiday that they
saw the chest of drawers. It was small, in a beautifully veined
walnut, and its bow front gave it an elegance which pleased them both.
They agreed that it was the sort of thing they liked, they looked at
it from all angles, discovered its price and then Neil said quietly,
<quote>Shall we buy it, Jane?</quote>
   <p><quote>Buy it?</quote> She looked at him quickly, her colour heightened.
   <p>He was not looking at her and there was some colour too in his
tanned face. <quote>I mean, when we see it &mdash; Dalnadoire needs a lot of
furniture and &mdash; later we might not see one we like as well as this
one.</quote>
   <p>Jane smiled. <quote>Could we, Neil?</quote> she asked.
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>Let's buy it then,</quote> she said in a matter-of-fact tone. <quote>I
can just see it against that short wall beyond the window, in what
will be the lounge.</quote>
   <p>He turned to her, smiling now. <quote>Have you time, Jane?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh yes,</quote> Jane said happily.
   <p>So on the Sunday Jane found a new task. With a soft duster she
had to carefully polish the lovely walnut chest. Neil watched her
young, earnest face lovingly, but with the shadow in his dark eyes
which was often there when his face was in repose and when he was
watching Jane. Later he took her off for a walk on to the moors.
   <p>The day was hot and in the early morning there had been a
suspicion of thunder, but the clouds had passed, although there was
still a heaviness in the air.
   <p>When they reached the second stile, Jane perched on the top of
it, and they looked back down the slope.
   <p><quote>A storm, if it isn't too wild, wouldn't do any harm,</quote> Neil
commented. <quote>The river is running much slower than usual.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes. Did you bathe in that pool above the falls when you were
a boy, Neil?</quote> she asked.
   <p>He grinned as he turned to look at her, leaning against her
knees. <quote>I did. Every morning before anyone else was astir I'd run
out and have ten glorious, splashing minutes, before I dashed back
again, pretending I'd never left the house.</quote>
   <p><quote>Did Mrs. Cummings object to you bathing?</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't know about the bathing, but she didn't want her house
messed up. Though one morning she did catch me, and I was the usual
lazy ingrate and so on and so on. I decided then, Jane,</quote> there was
a twinkle in his eyes as he went on, <quote>that my family &mdash; for some
unknown reason I seemed to think I was going to have several children
and that we'd be living at Dalnadoire &mdash; would be allowed to play in
that pool whenever they liked.</quote>
   <p>There was an answering twinkle in her blue eyes. <quote>Are you still
of the same opinion, Neil?</quote>
   <p>His smile widened. <quote>I am. But their mother would have to
approve. She mightn't think it a good idea.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm sure,</quote> Jane said carefully, <quote>that any girl you'd made
the mother of your children, would be quite sensible about that sort
of thing. She'd want them to have fun.</quote>
   <p>Neil laid his cheek against the back of her hand, which she had
resting lightly on his shoulder, for a moment. <quote>I think Dalnadoire
is a house which needs a family of children,</quote> he said quietly.
   <p><quote>It does,</quote> Jane agreed. <quote>It should be filled with fun and
laughter. Neil,</quote> she went on seriously, <quote>you never told me what
made you run away just at that time, after all those miserable years.
Was it because you were unhappy, a sort of cumulative unhappiness?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well,</quote> he answered slowly, <quote>I didn't run &mdash; I walked. All
the way from here to Aberdeen. Unhappy? I suppose that came into it.
But the main, the overwhelming reason, was pride.</quote>
   <p><quote>Pride?</quote> Jane repeated in surprise.
   <p><quote>Pride,</quote> he said again. <quote>To be told, day after day for all
those years, that you were living on charity, that there was no reason
why they should have to work their fingers to the bone to keep an
ungrateful cur like you were &mdash; I was determined that as soon as I
could I was going to go somewhere where she hadn't to keep me. And
what was more I was going to repay her all she'd had to spend on
me.</quote>
   <p><quote>But, Neil,</quote> Jane was red with indignation, <quote>you weren't
living on charity. It was yours.</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't know. And she said I was. I planned it carefully,
Jane.

   <p><quote>June, do you mean that?</quote> he exclaimed.
   <p><quote>Yes,</quote> she returned and her steady gaze conveyed as much as
the brief reply.
   <p>He caught his breath and swung back to his own seat. He started
the car, and sped on at a speed that gradually filled her with alarm.
   <p><quote>Where are we going? You must turn back!</quote> she cried, as a
milestone flashed by.
   <p><quote>We'll go where there can be no turning back,</quote> he replied.
<quote>We'll drive till midnight, and stay at the first place we come to.
Then neither of us can ever go back, and the matter will be
settled.</quote>
   <p><quote>Eustace!</quote> She caught hold of his arm. <quote>You're mad! Turn
back!</quote>
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he muttered. <quote>Other people give up everything for
love, and why not we? Love may not be all, but at least it's more
than all the rest. I can't give you up, June. I won't.</quote>
   <p>That his reckless impulse was due as much to pride and anger, the
chagrin of an imperious man thwarted, as to any warmer passion, made
it easier for her to recall him, his own natural good sense and
worship of the conventions coming to her aid, but June had her hands
over his, trying to force him to turn the car, which performed some
queer antics during the brief struggle, and she was imploring him,
half sobbing, before she succeeded in persuading him to bring the car
to a standstill.
   <p><quote>Oh, turn round and drive back at once,</quote> she cried, sobbing
openly now the danger was past. <quote>How could you be so mad?</quote>
   <p>He allowed her to shed agitated tears for some moments, without
offering a word of apology, his mouth compressed, his features cruel
in their clear-cut rigidity.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry,</quote> he said then. <quote>And nothing will make you alter
your decision?</quote>
   <p><quote>Please don't talk about it any more. Drive home.</quote>
   <p><quote>You think you'll make him happy by marrying him out of pity?</quote>
he asked.
   <p><quote>It isn't pity. I'm fond of him. I was glad when he asked me
to be his wife, and if &mdash; if meeting you earlier might have made a
difference, it can't do now. It would be mean to throw him aside,
just to suit my convenience.</quote>
   <p><quote>If he were well &mdash;</quote> began Hilton.
   <p><quote>I'd act exactly the same,</quote> she broke in. <quote>Please drive
back. It's quite dark.</quote>
   <p>Hilton gave a sigh of fierce protest, and in another minute they
were rushing back along the way they had come.
   <p>
   <p>AFTER a temporary improvement, Frank Elvington's health
ceased to show any advance. Even his own optimism became slightly
dimmed. Whilst still confident of his recovery, he did not talk of it
and his marriage with such eagerness as before, obviously regarding
both as some distance away.
   <p>June watched him with an ache in her heart. She seldom saw
Hilton, both she and he avoiding each other as much as possible, and
she devoted herself to Frank, trying to put Hilton out of her mind.
   <p>One day, when she found Frank preoccupied, he confessed that he
had been strongly advised to leave England, and had refused, at any
rate, for the present.
   <p><quote>But why not go, dear?</quote> she urged. <quote>You must do anything to
get better.</quote>
   <p><quote>Because I don't want to leave you,</quote> he confessed.
   <p><quote>You mustn't hesitate to go anywhere where there's the least
chance of hastening your recovery.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh &mdash; well,</quote> he said reluctantly. <quote>I've promised to think of
it.</quote>
   <p>Whilst he hesitated, June met Dr. Rother, who told her that
Frank's only chance of life was to sail immediately for South Africa.
He and Dr. Hilton, he added, had done wonders in keeping him alive
as long as they had done, but nothing more could be done for him in
England. The warm climate of South Africa was his last and only
chance.
   <p>June had not thought his danger so great, and hearing that Dr.
Hilton was still with him, she hastened to Cliff Top, and was in time
to stop Hilton as he crossed the wide entrance-hall to the door.
   <p>He was passing her with an inclination of his head.
   <p><quote>No,</quote> she said, unsteadily. <quote>I must speak to you, please!</quote>
   <p>He followed her into the room near by.
   <p><quote>Dr. Rother says that Frank must go away at once,</quote> she said.
   <p><quote>He has just consented to do so,</quote> replied Hilton.
   <p><quote>But is it true that this is his last chance?</quote> she asked, and
when he averted his head, not answering, <quote>Doctor Rother says it's
his only chance,</quote> she added distressfully.
   <p>He turned his head sharply looking down at her with a ruthless
directness, and his words fell with icy distinctness.
   <p><quote>It is not his only chance,</quote> he said. <quote>It is no chance at
all.</quote>
   <p>June turned white, her lips falling apart, speechless.
   <p><quote>He may never come back,</quote> announced Hilton deliberately.
   <p>She was horrified. For all her fears, it came as a shock to hear
Frank's doom pronounced in so many words. She looked out of the
window to where the leaves were already turning to pale yellow and
deep copper, a mellow sky above them and she thought of all the
beautiful things awaiting his enjoyment, of all the many years of life
he was to miss.
   <p><quote>Are you sure?</quote> she whispered.
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>He doesn't know?</quote> she faltered, and professional instinct
brought his brows together.
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he said, <quote>and you must not allow him to guess. I have
told you he may never come back, but that must not be repeated to him.
A patient's optimism has performed miracles before now.</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course, he must not be robbed of hope. But you don't expect
any miracle to happen?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p>There was a little pause, whilst June mourned. Remembering
Frank's unwillingness to be separated from her &mdash;
   <p><quote>Then is it any use sending him away to &mdash; to die among
strangers?</quote> she asked. <quote>He doesn't want to go.</quote>
   <p><quote>He must go,</quote> replied Hilton. <quote>However useless, we must
insist upon everything being done which possibly can be done.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, of course,</quote> she assented, sadly.
   <p><quote>You see, June,</quote> said Hilton, softly, <quote>you cannot put another
man in my place even if you wish.</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't talk of that,</quote> she begged. <quote>How long &mdash; how long do
you expect?</quote>
   <p><quote>It may be as long as seven or eight months, but you'll be
married to me before that, June.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, no!</quote> Even his attraction was powerless to affect her at
that moment. <quote>How can you mention such a thing?</quote>
   <p><quote>Our marriage won't hasten his end by so much as a second, for
he need not know of it,</quote> remarked Hilton, <quote>and I cannot pretend to
love you less, now I know you're going to be mine.</quote>
   <p>He stepped to the door and opened it for her to pass out. She
could not answer. She knew it was only natural that he should not be
deeply affected by Frank's death, and equally natural that he should
be pleased at the possibility of making her his wife, yet there seemed
something callous about his calmness.
   <p>She braced herself up to face Frank, but the ordeal was far worse
than she had expected, for she found him in quite good spirits,
waiting eagerly to tell her the news.
   <p><quote>June, darling, I'm going to South Africa,</quote> he announced.
<quote>I've just promised Hilton. He says I haven't a chance here, but
he's certain that a year out there will make me as well as ever I've
been. He's told me of another case similar to mine, which he sent out
there with excellent results. I didn't tell you, darling, but I
hadn't much faith in the idea before. I thought I'd perhaps go away
from you and &mdash; all to no purpose, and if I wasn't going to get better
I wanted to stay with you. But now I feel satisfied it's just a
year's absence and then &mdash; oh, June! &mdash; health and you! No price is too
great for that!</quote>
   <p>It took all her courage and self-control to hide her tragic
knowledge from him and to respond to his cheerful talk. She tried to
rememeber what Hilton had said of the miracles performed by optimism
and the desire for life, and to will passionately that Frank's belief
in his recovery would add another miracle to the annals of the sick.
   <p><quote>But oh, June, to leave you all that time!</quote> he exclaimed.
<quote>Eight or nine months at the very least, he said, and most probably
a year. Will you forget me in all that time?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, Frank, I'll be marking the days off on the calendar and
waiting for your return,</quote> she said, though she choked over the
words.
   <p>He pressed her fingers to his lips, afterwards holding her hand
close against his cheek.
   <p><quote>I'd rather stay here and die, with you beside me to the end,</quote>
he whispered, <quote>than go away for all that long dreary time and then
not return to you after all. Supposing something happens to part us,
June?</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothing will,</quote> she declared, with the tears running down her
cheeks, her hands holding him protectingly. <quote>Because do you know
why, Frank? Because we're not going to be parted.</quote>
   <p>She spoke vehemently in the impulse that had come to her, the
passionate desire to comfort and serve, to sweeten his tragedy.
   <p><quote>I'm going with you,</quote> she announced, firmly.
   <p><quote>June, darling!</quote> He raised himself, his face irradiated.
<quote>Do you really mean you'll marry me before I go?</quote>
   <p>She nodded, a smile quivering under her tears, and as he clasped
her to him, kissing and thanking her, she had no regret for her
impulse of pity, only a great thankfulness that she could at least
make his last months happy.
   <p><quote>Sweetheart, I'll ask so little of you,</quote> he whispered, when
his first rush of gratitude was over. <quote>I only want to have you with
me. You're not going to marry a miserable invalid. We'll have a real
honeymoon when I'm well. It will be something to get well for. Until
that time you'll be Mrs. Elvington only to other people. To me
you'll still be my beautiful sweetheart who's waiting for me. And oh,
darling, you won't have to wait long! I'll make such haste to get
well.</quote>
   <p>Every moment she remained with him increased her satisfaction
with the step she had taken, and when she left him she felt more at
peace than she had done since Eustace Hilton had come into her life.
   <p>She had undertaken a definite service, one that both her head and
her heart approved, and which left no room for personal
considerations.
   <p>Thus it was that when Hilton called that evening, she was beyond
his power to influence.
   <p>She was in her room, making out a list of the many things she
required to take with her out of England, when his car stopped at the
gate. Thinking it must be Frank who had sent for her, she leaned out
of the window, alarmed when she recognised the car, fearing he had
brought her ill news of Frank.
   <p>She did not imagine that he would pay her a visit except in
Frank's interest, and when she hurried into the room where her mother
was trying in vain to learn the reason of his visit, her first words
were of her fiancee .
   <p><quote>No,</quote> he replied, <quote>there is nothing to be anxious about, but
I shall be obliged if you can give me a few moments alone.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Arnage rose somewhat haughtily, taking her departure with
distinct displeasure. She might have borne much for Dr. Hilton
once, but as mother of the so soon-to-be Mrs. Frank Elvington, of
Cliff Top, she resented his cool dismissal.
   <p><quote>What is it?</quote> asked June, when she was alone with Hilton. She
could not think what had brought him.
   <p><quote>Elvington telephoned me to announce your immediate marriage,</quote>
he replied, through his teeth, it seemed, his tightened lips moved so
little.
   <p><quote>Oh!</quote>
   <p>June was simultaneously relieved and troubled. Relieved that his
call meant no fresh ill to Frank, distressed and perturbed that he
should be going to reopen personal matters which now more than ever
should be buried and forgotten.

<head>The Birds</head>
<head>A short story by Barbara Comyns</head>
   <p>Little Hal was like a boy made of butter &mdash; yellow complexion
and yellow hair. After his mother's death, his thin little face
contorted into sudden grimaces. His younger brother Charlie held up
his chubby arms with love towards Cousin Nelly, who kept house for
their father now he no longer had a wife; but Hal would sit behind the
shed door, grimacing under his large straw hat, his long yellow
fingers twisting the tags at the back of his boots.
   <p><squote>That boy's highly strung,</squote> Nelly would say to his father.
<squote>He don't seem natural. Why don't you get him a pet, Bert &mdash; a
kitten or a dog?</squote>
   <p><squote>He'll be all right when he goes to school,</squote> Bert would
answer, and he would give the robust Charlie a poke with his
earth-grimed forefinger, which caused the little boy to roll about
with laughter, then disappear under the green serge tablecloth until
Bert prodded him again and there would be more laughter.
   <p><squote>There's a boy for you,</squote> Bert would proclaim with pride, and
Hal's unnatural behaviour would be forgotten.
   <p>
   <p>Hal was not all right when he went to school. He was afraid
of the other children and was sick in the Plasticine box on the first
day. He refused to speak a word, and kept leaving his desk to stand
by the door and make faces. The following day he behaved in the same
way, except that he wasn't sick. As he stood by the door, a sinister
wet patch appeared round his feet and the children shouted, <squote>Please,
teacher, that there Hal has wet himself.</squote> The teacher, very red in
the face, gave Hal a smack on the hand with a ruler, and put some of
the sawdust that the chalks had been packed in on the wet patch. Hal
did not cry, but the rims of his eyes became red as though he had, and
he sat quite still for the rest of the morning just watching the door.
   <p>When Nelly came to fetch him home the teacher said, <squote>That Hal
of yours lives in a world of his own. He doesn't seem to be all
there.</squote> Nelly looked rather put out and replied that he was quite
all right, only the poor little chap was highly strung. <squote>His dad's
going to get him a pet. He'll be all right then, you'll see.</squote>
   <p>When Bert came home for his dinner she said, <squote>What about that
little cat or dog you were going to bring home for Hal, to give him an
interest in things. The boy wet himself at school today. It don't
seem natural at his age.</squote>
   <p>Hal's eyes became red rimmed again, but he did not speak. He
seldom did. His father said, <squote>Well, I've got him a little bird, but
I must buy a cage first. You'd like a nice green bird, wouldn't you,
Hal?</squote> The boy just nodded his head, but Charlie said, <squote>Charlie
wants a green bird too. Will it lay green eggs?</squote> and Nelly picked
him up and, hugging him, said he was a caution.
   <p>
   <p>The next day, when Hal returned from school, there was the
bird in a wooden cage with bars in front. His father showed him how
the cage should be cleaned and the seed and water containers filled;
and he told him that the bird could be taught to talk <squote>if you speak
to it nice and quiet.</squote>
   <p>Hal put the cage on the table and gazed at the bird, fascinated.
He put his face close and whispered something very softly, then put
his ear close, hoping for a reply. At that moment, Charlie came
running up and put his fingers between the bars, shouting ~<squote>Hallo,
green bird,</squote> and the terrified bird fluttered into a corner of its
cage. Hal turned to his brother and slapped his laughing, pink face.
Nelly jumped to her feet, yelling <squote>You've no call to do that.</squote>
Hal, afraid that his new treasure would be taken away from him,
picked up the cage and dashed from the house to the garden shed, where
he spent the afternoon softly talking to the bird and watching it.
   <p>He became devoted to the bird. He was allowed to keep it in his
bedroom under the eaves, where it was safe from Charlie. Usually,
when he came home from school, he would free the bird from its cage,
and it would fly around the room, picking up little things with its
beak and sometimes settling on Hal's head or hand. He talked to it
and he said it talked to him, but no one knew if this were true
because it flew back to the safety of its cage as soon as anyone else
entered the room.
   <p>The teacher said Hal was doing better at school &mdash; not that he
learnt anything, exactly, but he did sit still and behave better, and
sometimes drew birds in his copy-book. Perhaps he would get around to
letters later, she added.
   <p>
   <p>Then, one afternoon, a fearful thing happened. He was up in
that little room of his, with the bird sitting on his shoulder. He
was talking to it very quietly, and perhaps the bird was talking
back &mdash; no one knew for sure. Outside the door, Charlie was listening
hard because he wanted to hear the bird talk too. Suddenly he burst
the door open and cried, <squote>I heard it, I did.</squote>
   <p>The bird left Hal's shoulder and, afraid, flew across the room,
searching for its cage. Not knowing about reflections, it first flew
straight into the old brown-framed mirror on Hal's chest-of-drawers
and then, in panic, out of the open window and away. Hal knew at once
that his bird had gone and would never come back.
   <p>It was after the bird's disappearance that Hal had his first sort
of fit. He never mentioned the bird again. Perhaps he had even
forgotten all about it, but as he almost never spoke now no one really
knew what he was thinking about. He had taken to sitting behind the
shed door again, and sometimes he could be heard talking to himself.
   <p>It was in September that Bert brought home the two cockerels, one
white, one black. They were leggy young birds, just growing their
wing feathers. The father said to his boys, <squote>There's a bird apiece
for you. I want you to fatten them up, and when they are fit for
eating we'll have a great party and Nelly will become your mother.
Now see which of you can make his bird grow the biggest.</squote>
   <p>Charlie chose the white bird and Hal had to have the black. It
was slightly on the small side, but the difference in size soon
changed and Hal's bird grew and grew. On the way home from school he
gathered corn from the sides of the fields and stuffed it in his
pockets, and as soon as he came in by the gate the cockerel used to
run to meet him. Nelly said, <squote>Well, Hal, I must say your cock is
growing into a fine bird. Little Charlie's can't hold a candle to
it.</squote> Hal gave one of his rare smiles and looked at his bird with
pride. It certainly was almost twice the size of Charlie's.
   <p>The cockerels grew very large, and early in December Bert said,
<squote>Nelly, those birds are ready. We must see about the banns.</squote>
When Hal heard his father say this he knew that one day when he came
home from school his cockerel would not be there to meet him. It
would have to be sacrificed if there was to be a party and Nelly was
to become his mother. He could imagine everyone's surprise when Nelly
began to change. He wondered if she would be wearing mama's blue
dress with the lace on the collar. Perhaps, as it was winter, it
would be the brown one trimmed with braid, in patterns he thought
resembled snail shells.
   <p>
   <p>The days passed and still the glossy black cock waited by the
garden gate for Hal's return from school. Some days he felt he could
not bear it any longer, and he would plan to ask his father to cancel
the party so that his bird would be saved; but this would mean that
Nelly would not turn into his mother, and that would be terrible. The
black cock would have to die. He almost wished it would peck him so
that he need not love it so much. Charlie had given up feeding his
because it had pecked him right across the nose. Nelly had thrown a
stone at it and shouted, <squote>Your days are numbered, you bad old
bird.</squote>
   <p>Then, one afternoon when Hal came home, there was no cock waiting
by the gate, and the knob on the kitchen door had blood and feathers
stuck to it. He went to the back of the shed and was sick. When he
saw Nelly he asked her when it was she was going to turn into his
mama.
   <p><squote>Why, fancy you remembering that, you clever boy! In two days I
will be your mama and cousin too.</squote>
   <p>Hal sat on his stool by the fire and tried to work this out in
his mind. Later, he asked, ~<squote>Will you have two heads?</squote> and Nelly
said, <squote>Bless the boy. Whatever is he thinking about now?</squote>
   <p>
   <p>The day of the wedding came. Hal and Charlie had new blue
shirts and new belts with buckles to fasten them, shaped like snakes.
Nelly had a green velvet dress and a hat with pansies on it. When
Hal asked her why she wasn't wearing his mother's brown dress, she
replied, <squote>Oh, that old thing! Why the moths had it months ago.</squote>
   <p>The cottage became filled with people, and there was a lot of
noisy talk and laughter. Then it was time for the party, and they all
sat down to devour Hal's and Charlie's birds. When Hal could bring
himself to look at the steaming brown carcasses he could see how much
larger his bird was than his brother's, and although he felt a great
sadness there was a feeling of pride as well.
   <p>A man with a large waxed moustache and a mop of curly damp hair,
whom Hal thought might be his uncle Fred, said, <squote>That's a fine bird
you're carving, Bert.</squote> Hal waited, breathless, to hear his father
tell everyone that it was his bird that was so large, but Bert was too
preoccupied with carving to answer. Sweat was pouring down his face,
and he did not like to take his jacket off in company. Later, he
turned to Hal and said, ~<squote>You'd like a little of the breast and
perhaps some stuffing, Hal?</squote> and the boy replied that he would like
to eat some of the smaller bird, please. He could not eat his own; it
was dreadful to see it there all cut about.
   <p>Every now and then he'd look down the table at Nelly, who was
sitting there looking flushed and very pretty, but not in the least
like his mama. The cocks had been killed and were almost eaten now
and the party had been going on a long time, but there was no sign of
his mother's return. Perhaps there was some mistake. The last knife
and fork had ceased to rattle against the plate, and the bottle of
port had been opened. For a moment there was silence; then Hal braced
himself to ask, <squote>Dad, whose bird was the largest, Charlie's or
mine?</squote> Everyone turned towards him in surprise and, with half a
smile on his face, he waited for them to know whose had been that
splendid bird.
   <p>Bert considered for a moment. Then, remembering that Hal had
asked for a slice from the little bird, he answered, <squote>They were both
real fine birds. I was proud to carve them. Yours was very tender
but I think Charlie's was the largest.</squote>

<text id=LOBP19>
   <p>It was one of the strangest courtships I'd ever known &mdash; it held
society gossips by the ears all that Season
<head>A pretty case for Freud</head>
<head>BY ALEC WAUGH</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY BOB PEAKE</head>
   <p>I NOTICED him in the first place because he was the only
other person in the pavilion wearing a silk hat. I had the excuse of
having come on there from a wedding. But I should have gone back and
changed had I known how conspicuous I should be.
   <p>It was ten years since I had been to the Varsity Match at Lord's.
And I was astonished by the change; by the empty stands, the absence
of smart frocks, the lounge-suited atmosphere of the enclosures. A
social occasion, for whose sake in remote rectories mothballs had been
once shaken out of braided coats and wide-brimmed <quote>toppers</quote>
stripped of their tissue wrappings, was now a very ordinary cricket
match in which the general public took little interest.
   <p>As I walked in my sponge-bag trousers and shining hat through the
long, high, many-windowed morning room, I felt as antediluvian as the
curved bats and pastoral portraits that adorn its walls: so
antediluvian that as I took my seat beside the one other Edwardian
survival, a hackneyed Latin tag &mdash; the tongue that it is a solecism now
to quote &mdash; actually seemed appropriate to the occasion.
   <p>I thought of Lord's as the pre-war pages of Punch presented
it; of Lord's as I had known it in the early 'twenties; the
tight-packed mounds; the coaches by the tavern; the parade of parasols
between the innings; colour, excitement, glamour; and now this:
Homburgs and bowler hats in the pavilion, long terraces of white
beside the screen... Nos duo turba sumus, I thought, as I
leant sideways towards my fellow relic.
   <p><quote>I wonder,</quote> I asked, <quote>if I might see your scorecard?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>HE turned; and I immediately forgot that it was a need for
sartorial kinship that had decided my choice of seat.
   <p>He was one of the most striking-looking men that I have ever
seen.
   <p>He was young: in the latish twenties; and handsome in a
clear-skinned way. But it was not merely his good looks that startled
me. The impression that he made is not to be explained by any
cataloguing of separate features; high forehead, grey-blue eyes, full
mouth, long pointed nose. I was no more conscious of those separate
features than one is of the pattern on a transparent lampshade. Just
as there are two kinds of lampshade, the one whose object it is to
retransmit a softened light and the other that is a decoration,
simply; so are there certain types of face, the one in which the
personality is subservient to the featured mask of lip, brow, cheek,
to which it gives mobility and meaning, the other in which you are so
exclusively conscious of the personality behind that mask that you
sometimes find yourself unable to describe the physical appearance of
someone with the very texture of whose thought you are familiar.
   <p>It was like that now. I was conscious not of a handsome face,
but of a new person; of someone who was masterful but unworldly;
practical but inexperienced; masculine but with that look of
anticipation, of waiting to be fulfilled that you expect to find in a
young girl; a combination of characteristics so self-contradictory
that the obvious corollary to their catalogue would be: <quote>What a mass
of complexes. A pretty case for Freud.</quote> That was what you would
have expected.
   <p>He wasn't, though. He was of a piece, without
self-consciousness; the kind of man who does not know what the word
shyness means.
   <p>I was curious, alert, excited. I've got to find out who you are,
I thought.
   <p>In the lazy atmosphere of a cricket match it is easy to start a
conversation. The cricket was slow, desultory, undramatic. In a
little while we were more interested in our talk than in the match.
At any rate, I was.
   <p>His talk had the same contradictory characteristics as his
appearance. It was boyishly eager, yet at the same time
authoritative. It was the talk of one who stood on the brink of
experience, yet was accustomed to the exercise of authority. More
baffling still, though his voice had a slightly mannered intonation,
it had no trace of the drawl that you would expect to find in a
fashionably-dressed young man. He was a puzzle, right enough.
   <p>
   <p>THE hands of the turret clock pointed to five o'clock.
Stumps would not be drawn till half past six. In an hour and a half
I ought to be able to find out something about him.
   <p>Luck came my way.
   <p>An exchange of ideas became an argument, a point which could only
be settled by the consultation of a particular book of reference. I
had fancied the book was in the pavilion library. It did not prove to
be; or anyhow, we could not find it. I happened to have a copy at my
flat.
   <p><quote>It's not five minutes' walk away,</quote> I said. <quote>Let's go back
there afterwards and have a sherry.</quote>
   <p><quote>Let's go back now. This cricket bores me.</quote>
   <p>An answer that combined his boyishness and his authority; his
readiness to accept new suggestions with his assumption that no wish
of his would be contradicted. It did not occur to him that I might
want to stay on and watch the cricket. Like a schoolboy on his way to
a party he chattered without stopping till we reached the large,
barrack-shaped apartment-house on whose highest floor I had a one-room
flat where I keep clothes and papers, that I use as a kind of office
pied-&agrave;-terre when I am in London.
   <p><quote>Is this where you live?</quote> he asked.
   <p>I nodded.
   <p>
   <p>HE looked up inquisitively at its straight sheer surface,
as though he were seeing this particular kind of building for the
first time; as though he were a foreigner obtaining the material for a
monograph <quote>How London Lives</quote>.
   <p>As I opened the cocktail cabinet and set about the preparation of
an <quote>old-fashioned</quote>, he deployed none of the diplomatically assumed
indifference with which it is customary to take stock of a new room
without letting it appear that you are conscious of being in one.
   <p>With an unabashed curiosity he took a mental inventory of the
room: its lighting, its shelves, its chairs, its pictures, the jumble
of knick-knacks along the mantelpiece; then started on a tour of
investigation, taking up a book, peering into an etching, lifting a
cigarette-box; without comment, as though he were visiting an
exhibition, till suddenly, with a note of real interest in his voice,
~<quote>What's that doing here?</quote> he asked.
   <p>He was pointing to the framed original of a jacket design for one
of my novels.
   <p><quote>That? Oh, I'm responsible for that.</quote>
   <p><quote>You drew the picture?</quote>
   <p><quote>No &mdash; wrote the book.</quote>
   <p><quote>What, you, the author!</quote>
   <p>There was a surprised excitement in his voice that I should have
found extremely flattering had not experience counselled me against a
readiness to believe that here, at last, I was about to meet the
perfect, that dream reader whom every novelist is convinced must exist
somewhere, the one reader who has not only read everything that he has
written, but read between the lines.
   <p>On those rare occasions I really am the target at which
enthusiasm is directed, it is usually to receive some such testimonial
as <quote>I've been wanting to meet you for so long. There's a mistake in
that last book but one of yours that I've been longing to point out.
On page thirty-seven you talk about Mildred's gas fire, and in the
last chapter you have coals falling through a grate. Now I wonder if
anyone else has spotted that?</quote>
   <p>Previous experience did not encourage me to expect from my
guest's excitement a long, sympathetic, interpretive analysis of my
short stories. I should have been disappointed if I had.
   <p><quote>There's something I've always wanted to ask you. Was Julia
Thirleigh really the model for your heroine?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well...</quote>
   <p>It is the kind of question that usually a novelist resents;
resents because it is impossible to reply honestly. The answer is
always <quote>Yes and No</quote>. No full-length character is ever a direct
portrait; yet no character that is alive has not been drawn in part
from life. A trick of speech has been borrowed here, a gesture there.
The process of creation must start somewhere; must have some solid
foundation in experience. But by the time the story is quarter
finished, the novelist has forgotten his model altogether; his
character has developed a temperament and destiny of its own.
   <p>
   <p>USUALLY, at least, that is the way it happens. In the case
of Julia Thirleigh it had been rather different; possibly because I
have <quote>put</quote> her into the kind of novel that is less a story than an
argument, that requires distinct types to contrast different points of
view. I needed a character to typify the debutante of the late
nineteen-twenties, the second edition of the Bright Young People, the
London of the slump. And it was just because Julia is herself less a
person than a type that, when I had finished the book, I was
astonished to find how closely my finished character resembled the
model which i had meant to employ merely as a first sketch: so closely
that I did not see how a great many people could fail to recognise
her.
   <p>Through a decade when young women not only claimed, but asserted,
their right to the same independence as their brothers, Julia was the
most discussed of those Londoners whose activities are photographed
week by week in The Tatler and Bystander and Sketch.
   <p>She was not so much famous as notorious. She had avoided, it
is true, any open scandal. She had not shot an unfaithful suitor,
been convicted as a drug addict or cited in the divorce courts. To
that extent she had been discreet.
   <p>At the same time she had been subpoenaed in a slander suit that
had been heard in camera. It was at one of her
bottle-parties in a top-storey studio that a free fight with
gate-crashers had ended in a crumpled figure on the pavement and a
comment from the coroner that only her most loyal friends held to be
unjustified. There had been no open scandal.
   <p>But the clothes she had worn, the company she had kept, her
manner, her habits, her whole way of living had given her the kind of
label that made her current coin in any argument.
   <p><quote>Well now, take somebody like Julia...</quote> and when people said
that, no one had any doubt of what was meant.
   <p>
   <p>PRUDENCE as well as friendship counselled me to show my
manuscript to Julia before I delivered it to my publisher.
   <p>She returned it with a very typical remark.
   <p><quote>I don't use Blue-grass.</quote>
   <p><quote>Is that your only comment?</quote>
   <p><quote>My only criticism.</quote>
   <p><quote>There's nothing there that you object to?</quote> I asked her.
   <p><quote>Why should there be?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well...</quote>
   <p>She smiled.
   <p><quote>Is there anything in your book that people haven't said about
me and believed about me?</quote>
   <p><quote>There's a difference between gossip and a thing said in
print.</quote>
   <p><quote>If your publishers are afraid of libel I'll write them a letter
of absolution.</quote>
   <p>I could scarcely deny, in the face of that, that I had used Julia
as a model, yet I was reluctant to admit that my character was a
photograph.
   <p><quote>In a kind of way,</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>You did? I'd always heard you did, but I wasn't certain. You
must know her, then?</quote>
   <p><quote>I was lunching with her yesterday.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yesterday!</quote>
   <p>He regarded me with a strange veneration, as though I were haloed
in such a light as had transfigured Moses on his descent from Sinai.
   <p>
   <p><quote>YESTERDAY! I can hardly believe it. I've heard so much
about her, read so much about her. It's strange to be meeting
somebody who really knows her. Is she as beautiful as her
photographs? They are all so different.

<head>COMPLETE STORY by May Somerset</head>
<head>So she invented George</head>
   <p>To be young &mdash; and alone &mdash; in Paris... What else could either
of them do but pretend they were in love?
   <p>
   <p>JUDY stuck it for two days. Then she revolted. And, being
Judy, she decided she must do something about it.
   <p>Coming to Paris had been the biggest thrill in all the twenty
years of her life. She had got the chance when Mr. Cartwright's
personal assistant had fallen ill at the last moment.
   <p>Judy, who had worked under her, knew more about what this Paris
conference was about than anyone else in the office &mdash; apart from Mr.
Cartwright, of course.
   <p>So, at two days' notice, she was off to Paris.
   <p>Paris in the spring! With mist rising from the Seine in the
early morning and the cafes gaily spilling out across the pavements in
the midday sunshine.
   <p>She could see Notre Dame from her hotel window and the Arc \de
Triomphe from the window of the office where the conference was being
held.
   <p>It was all fabulous. Walking to work, she wanted to sing. At
lunch time she was torn between the desire to window shop and just sit
at a cafe table and watch the world go by.
   <p>It was the evenings that were the trouble.
   <p>Strolling along the streets, exploring Montmartre or the Isle \de
Cite was possible only if she had company. Alone, it was apt to give
the wrong impression. As Judy had found out.
   <p>Another girl would have done; or an aunt or uncle, father or
mother. It didn't have to be a young man; though, naturally, that
would have been better still.
   <p>Judy knew no one in Paris, except Mr. Cartwright, who was
engaged every evening, and who was, anyway, at least sixty.
   <p>But she certainly was not going to spend ten glorious evenings
sitting in her hotel.
   <p>So, something had to be done. And there was something she could
do. At least, there was the possibility of something. Being Judy,
that was enough.
   <p>One other person shared the room she had been given to work in,
when she was not actually in the conference chamber taking notes. He
was the personal assistant to the leader of the other English
delegation.
   <p>His name, she knew, was Charles Hanson. He was tall and lean and
quite heart-stoppingly handsome, or would have been if he hadn't
looked so solemn all the time.
   <p>He sat across the room from her and concentrated on his work.
   <p>Obviously he was immune to females or, at any rate, he was intent
on giving that impression.
   <p>But he was the only possibility. On the third afternoon of her
stay Judy was desperate at the thought of another wasted evening in
front of her.
   <p>She didn't want to scare the poor man across the room. Neither
did she want to give him the impression that she was <quote>that</quote> type of
girl.
   <p>All she wanted was a companion so that she could move freely in
the evenings.
   <p>She'd make quite, quite sure there wouldn't be any
misunderstanding about it.
   <p>So she invented George. Well, perhaps not quite invented.
Because there was a George at home in England and he was apt to
proudly announce he was <quote>her fellow,</quote> and there was no need to
explain that he was five years old and her nephew into the bargain.
   <p>
   <p>COMING back to the office after lunch, Judy stood at the
big window for a moment before she went to her desk.
   <p>Below, in the Champs Elysees, the cars glittered in the sun and
the pedestrians were dappled by leaf shadows.
   <p>Then, abruptly, she turned round.
   <p><quote>Oh, I wish George was here.</quote>
   <p><quote>Eh?</quote> Charles Hanson was already at his desk. He raised his
head, looking a trifle startled.
   <p>Judy crossed to her own desk. <quote>I said I wished George was
here,</quote> she repeated. <quote>He &mdash; he's someone I go about with a lot in
London. It would be so heavenly to have him to go about with here.
What do you do with your evenings here?</quote>
   <p><quote>Er &mdash; so far I've gone for walks.</quote>
   <p><quote>Are you going for one tonight?</quote>
   <p><quote>I &mdash; yes, I thought of doing that.</quote>
   <p><quote>By yourself?</quote>
   <p>He straightened a little. <quote>Certainly by myself. I don't know
anyone in Paris.</quote>
   <p><quote>Neither do I. That's the trouble.</quote>
   <p>She launched herself into her plan. <quote>You see, it's all very
well for you; you can go for walks by yourself, explore anywhere you
like. But I can't; not alone. People seem to &mdash; to get the idea that
I don't really want to be alone.
   <p><quote>I'll go crazy if I have to spend every single evening that I'm
in Paris just sitting in the hotel. Why, I may never get the chance
to come here again.
   <p><quote>It would be all right if &mdash; George was here. But he isn't. So
please, when you go for your walk, may I come with you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Good heavens! Do you know, I never thought of that. I
imagined you'd have lots of friends; be out every night.</quote>
   <p><quote>I haven't and I'm not,</quote> she retorted. <quote>I came at two days'
notice, so there wasn't even time to find out if anyone I knew had
friends in Paris. I know George hasn't.</quote> She had to keep him in
the foreground. <quote>He's never been to Paris.</quote> That was true,
anyhow.
   <p><quote>Wouldn't George mind if you came out with me?</quote>
   <p>Judy felt her colour rising. Thank goodness he had no means of
knowing she always did blush furiously if she had told even the
tiniest and whitest of lies!
   <p><quote>Well, he does rather like me to himself.</quote> That, too, was
true.
   <p><quote>But I can't waste all my evenings here. I want to see so much.
I want to go on buses and the Metro, up to Montmartre and along the
Left Bank. I want to go on a river trip.</quote>
   <p>Then a thought struck her. She had invented George, but, after
all, Charles Hanson might have someone who would prefer that he did
spend his evenings in Paris in lonely solitude.
   <p><quote>Of course, if you've got someone who might not like it...</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I don't think Peggy would take to the idea, but she isn't
here, is she?</quote>
   <p>Suddenly he grinned. <quote>If you'll risk George finding out, I'll
do the same with Peggy. After all, as you obviously can't go around
by yourself I'd be a boor to condemn you to your hotel for the rest of
your evenings in Paris.
   <p><quote>So, shall we say six o'clock, providing this afternoon's
conference doesn't run late. Still, as we'll both be there...</quote>
   <p>They met at six, by the elevators on the ground floor.
   <p>Charles grinned again as she came towards him and Judy found
herself thinking that this Peggy was pretty lucky.
   <p>Plainly, Charles was shy at first, but when his smile was so wide
and friendly you just had to like him.
   <p>As far as the evening was concerned, her plan couldn't have
worked better. She'd been right in thinking that Paris in the
evening, with a companion, would be a simply wonderful place.
   <p>They ate in the Place \de Republique and then went up to
Montmartre and found a fair going on in the streets.
   <p>They talked and laughed with all sorts of people. They had
coffee at several different cafes. They looked down on the twinkling
lights of Paris. And then they walked down the steep streets and back
to her hotel.
   <p><quote>It was marvellous!</quote> There were stars in Judy's eyes. <quote>It's
exactly as I thought it would be.</quote>
   <p>He looked down at her. <quote>You must bring George here, one day,
and show it to him. Is he fun to be with?</quote>
   <p>Because she felt such a stab of guilt she said quickly: <quote>He's
the greatest fun in the world. And I will bring him one day.</quote>
   <p>She'd be grey-haired by the time he was old enough and probably
still a spinster.
   <p><quote>Will you bring Peggy, too?</quote> she asked.
   <p>He hesitated, then he shook his head. <quote>I don't think so. She
finds going abroad too complicated. She's content with Britain.</quote>
   <p>So Paris could stay <quote>theirs.</quote>
   <p>Judy couldn't help her heart giving a little leap. Neither could
she help the malicious little thought that Peggy sounded both drab and
dreary.
   <p>Charles was certainly neither.
   <p>
   <p>SHE took herself to task several times during the next few
days, however. After all, she had thrust herself on to Charles when,
quite obviously, he'd had every intention of staying solitarily true
to Peggy.
   <p>To do anything unfair to Peggy would be mean and despicable.
   <p>But it was a little difficult to remember that when they were
seated, shoulder to shoulder, on a boat on the Seine and there was a
moon overhead.
   <p>Neither was it easy when they walked back to her hotel and their
hands touched and linked for a moment before she pulled hers away.
   <p><quote>George?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>And Peggy,</quote> she retorted, almost sharply.
   <p>He moved a little away from her.
   <p><quote>You're right, of course. But it's been a good evening, hasn't
it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Wonderful.</quote> It was extraordinary how it could hurt to say
just one word.
   <p>It would have been silly &mdash; and it would have admitted things she
didn't want to admit if she had refused to go out with him any more.
   <p>So at the week-end they explored further. They went to St
Cloud and, of course, Versailles.
   <p>The sun continued to shine and Judy wore the summer dresses she
had packed with so much excitement.
   <p>But at night, back in her hotel room, she took to standing at her
window for a long time, leaning on the window sill and looking out at
Paris as it slept.
   <p>She was storing it all up in her heart. Though now, she knew, it
would hurt unbearably every time she remembered it, and she would go
on remembering it all her life.
   <p>Perhaps Charles would remember, too, even if he did have his
Peggy who never wanted to leave England. She certainly couldn't know
what she was missing.
   <p>Charles was lucky; this could fade to a dream for him. He had
someone to put in its place.
   <p>But she &mdash; well, George, at five years old, didn't promise to be
much help, even though she did love him so much.
   <p>Rather ostentatiously she bought postcards for George everywhere
they went. If Charles didn't like it, well, he could buy them for
Peggy, couldn't he?
   <p>Inevitably their last day came, their last evening.
   <p><quote>We're doing a show tonight,</quote> Charles informed her
masterfully. <quote>And a night club afterwards. You're not going back to
George without sampling that side of Paris night life.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>ACTUALLY Judy didn't enjoy it very much. She kept
remembering that tomorrow night she'd be back home, and there would be
no Charles.
   <p>It was her own fault, of course. She had started it all, and if
she'd got hurt there was no one else to blame.
   <p>But it was going to be lonely after tonight. And the loneliness
seemed to have crept into her heart already.
   <p>After they had been at the night club for some time they fell
silent.
   <p>Judy watched the dancers firmly. She mustn't blink or the tears
in her eyes might spill over, and she knew that Charles was looking at
her averted face.
   <p><quote>Ready to go?</quote> He said suddenly.
   <p><quote>Quite ready.</quote> She rose at once.
   <p>But when they were outside neither of them made any attempt to
turn in the direction of her hotel.
   <p>The night club was in Montmartre and, wordlessly, they walked up
towards the Sacre Coeur, and then, in the shadow of the great church,
they turned and looked down over Paris.
   <p>The moon was paling; it was almost dawn.
   <p>Charles said softly: <quote>Shall we see the sunrise? Everyone
should do that once.</quote>
   <p>So they waited, and gradually the sky turned to a pale green and
then to pink and then to misty gold which seemed to envelop
everything.
   <p>Judy knew that if she made the slightest move towards Charles she
would be in his arms.

<text id=LOBP21>
   <p><quote>Tell me, how did you come? Did Weir bring you?</quote>
   <p>Before Linda could make any reply Ralph Batley's voice cut in
sharply from behind her, saying:
   <p><quote>This is my uncle, Mr. MacNally, and this</quote> &mdash; the hand came
past her and rested on the boy's head &mdash; <quote>this is my nephew,
Michael.</quote> Before she could acknowledge the introductions he went
on: <quote>Take Miss Metcalfe up to the house, Uncle Shane.</quote>
   <p><quote>Aye, Ralph. Yes, I'll do that. Will you come along now?</quote>
The old man backed away from her, one arm extended in a courtly
gesture. She felt inclined to laugh. From first impressions she
didn't think she would get many laughs from her employer, but this old
man seemed to be bubbling with a peculiar sense of joy.
   <p>In the yard the wind tore at them, and as the old man steadied
her with his hand on her elbow he yelled: <quote>Have you long come? I've
been away up in the top field, the fence is flat.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, I've just arrived.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then you haven't been in the house at all?</quote> His voice was
high with surprise.
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p>She could feel his bewilderment. <quote>I wondered about your case
there.</quote> He put out his hand for it, and she let him take it from
her.
   <p><quote>Did Weir bring you up? You didn't say.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, Mr. Weir was out.</quote>
   <p><quote>You couldn't have got here afore dark then?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, I lost my way and I arrived at another farm. The name</quote> &mdash;
she paused, then went on &mdash; <quote>the name was Cadwell.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>THE old man came to an abrupt stop and his hand came off
her arm. He turned to the boy and said: <quote>Michael. Here, take hold
of this case and go on up.</quote> He pushed the case and the lamp into
the boy's hands, then added: <quote>Away with you now.</quote> It wasn't until
the child had moved off that he said quickly: <quote>Don't tell me that a
Cadwell brought you up here, then?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, the young man. Rouse, I think his name was.</quote>
   <p><quote>You didn't tell him &mdash; Ralph back there?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I'm afraid I did, I didn't see any reason not to. What
have I done wrong?</quote> There was a tremor of apprehension in her
voice. <quote>I didn't know that Mr. Cadwell and Mr. Batley were at
loggerheads. I'm terribly sorry if I've caused &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>That's all right, you weren't to know, girl, but I don't know
how Maggie will take this. Come,</quote> and he took hold of her arm
again.
   <p>They were walking along a broad flagged terrace now and the wind
was meeting them head-on, and when they reached the porch they both
stood panting for a moment, before the old man said: <quote>I'll take off
me boots. Maggie would brain me if I went in with me boots on.</quote>
Then bending towards Linda he whispered: <quote>Wipe your feet &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Feeling very like a child, Linda did as she was requested, while
she watched him hop from one stockinged foot to the other over the
cold stone flags to the door. When he opened the door the reason was
made plain, for the floor on to which she stepped was polished as she
had never before seen a floor polished.
   <p>But her attention was lifted from the floor to the hall which
opened out before her, for in size and shape it was an exact replica
of the hall of the Cadwells' house. There was the same large open
fireplace. There was the same winding staircase going off to the left
with the balcony running from it along the entire length of the far
wall; yet for all the similarity this hall had nothing of the other's
charm.
   <p>A long black oak refectory table ran lengthways down the hall.
Standing with her back to it was a woman. She was of medium height
with greying hair and had two patches of red high on her cheek bones.
Her expression checked Linda's progress.
   <p>
   <p>THE Cadwells had looked at her each in their own way.
Ralph Batley's appraisal had shown his surprise. The old man had
greeted her gleefully, the boy with wonder; but this woman's look was
so different. It seemed as if she was being called upon to make a
quick decision and was finding the process difficult.
   <p>The woman was now coming towards Linda.
   <p><quote>I'm sorry you've had to find your own way. When you didn't
come at two he thought maybe... anyway he couldn't leave the
calving.</quote> The woman's voice was soft and thick and pleasant, but
before Linda could say anything she had turned on the old man, crying:
<quote>It's your fault. Where d'you think you've been?</quote>
   <p><quote>Now Maggie, whisht a while, I was up in the top field with
the railings as flat as a pancake. You wouldn't have me let the
cattle get through, now would you?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh.</quote> She moved her head impatiently then turned to Linda
saying: <quote>Well, come in, come in. Here, let me have your coat.
You'll be frozen.</quote>
   <p>As Linda took off her coat Shane, tripping towards the fire-place
like an aged gnome, said gaily: <quote>She's got her hand in already,
Maggie, she's been helping with the calving.</quote>
   <p><quote>Helping with the calving?</quote> The woman looked up at her
incredulously.
   <p>Linda, going hot with what she knew was to come, said hesitantly:
<quote>Apparently I came in the back way. I saw the light in the byre.</quote>
   <p><quote>You came in the back way? From the main road?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh.</quote> She nodded at Linda, a smile now softening her face.
<quote>Mr. Weir brought you?</quote>
   <p><quote>No.</quote>
   <p><quote>No. Weir didn't bring her.</quote> They all turned their eyes
towards the door under the balcony through which Ralph Batley was
entering the room. As he came slowly across the hall he said to no
one in particular: <quote>She took the wrong road.</quote>
   <p>She watched him reach up to the high mantelshelf and take a pipe
from out of a wooden rack, then he turned to his mother. But his eyes
remained on the pipe as he said heavily: <quote>She forked right at the
cliff end.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Batley's brown eyes were wide and, unmistakably, there was
fear in them.
   <p>Ralph Batley turned from his mother's gaze to the fire now and
lifting his foot he thrust it into the heart of the blazing logs. A
shower of sparks sprayed around the chimney. Then taking a home-made
spill from out of a bunch and putting it towards the blaze, he said
coldly: <quote>Our neighbours were kind enough to bring her to the top
gate.</quote>
   <p>He was attempting to light an empty pipe. Realising this he
threw the spill into the fire and, as if to cover up his mistake, said
with a poor attempt at lightness: <quote>I'm forgetting, you haven't met
my mother.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Batley's response to this was to say quietly: <quote>You'll be
wanting a wash, will you come up?</quote> She turned about and walked
across the hall. Linda, picking up her case, followed her up the
stairs, along the balcony to the far end. There Mrs. Batley opened
a door, saying over her shoulder: <quote>I hope you'll be quite
comfortable.</quote>
   <p>Linda moved into the room. Then turning quickly about she looked
at the older woman appealingly and said under her breath: <quote>Mrs.
Batley, I seem to have done something wrong. I'm sorry.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Batley stared at her for a moment, then stepping into the
bedroom and closing the door behind her, said: <quote>I'm sorry too, my
dear. I'm sorry you had to start like this. One thing I'll ask of
you, keep away from the</quote> &mdash; she paused here, then brought out &mdash; <quote>the
Cadwells. If you want to work here and in peace, don't even mention
their name. And another thing I would ask you, do your best for him,
will you? You see he never wanted a woman on the place. But I was
for it, and you're not quite what I expected.</quote> She held up her
hand. <quote>No offence meant, but you don't look exactly cut out for this
life. Still, time will tell. Come down when you're ready.</quote>
   <p>She went quickly out of the room leaving Linda staring at the
closed door in bewilderment.
   <p>Slowly she turned and looked about her, and what she saw held
some comfort, for there was a wood fire burning in the grate, the
furniture was old-fashioned but solid and shining. The floor was bare
wood and again highly polished, and before the hearth and by the side
of the bed were two clippie rugs. In the corner stood her trunk and
two cases. This then was her room. It was comfortable and homely,
but all she wanted to do was sit down and cry.
   <p>
   <p>LINDA did not unpack but washed herself and combed her
hair. Yet fifteen minutes later when she went quietly down the
stairs, she could have been dressed for a ball, the way their eyes
turned and watched her approach.
   <p>The table was set now with a white cloth and was laden with food
and she said apologetically: <quote>I hope I haven't kept you all
waiting.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, no, we're just going to start. Come and sit down.</quote>
Mrs. Batley took her seat at one end of the table and indicated a
chair to the right of her.
   <p>Linda had always considered that she had a good appetite although
she may not have shown it in her figure, but she could not attempt to
eat half of the dishes that were offered to her. There was little
talking during the meal except at one stage when Mrs. Batley asked:
<quote>Are your parents in farming?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, but my uncle, my mother's brother, manages a farm.</quote>
   <p>No one made any comment on this and Mrs. Batley put in quickly:
<quote>Well if you've all had sufficient you can make a move to the
fire.</quote>
   <p>Linda's help was accepted by Mrs. Batley without comment.
   <p>When some time later she was standing at the sink drying the
dishes that Mrs. Batley had washed and was searching in her mind for
something to say to break the awkward silence, Mrs. Batley said very
softly: <quote>Were you inside the house?</quote>
   <p><quote>You mean the Cadwells?</quote> Linda's voice, too, was quiet.
   <p>Mrs. Batley nodded.
   <p><quote>Yes, I was in the hall.</quote>
   <p>The older woman flicked her hands downwards into the sink with a
violent movement, and with a harsh bitterness but still under her
breath she said: <quote>I suppose you're comparing it with ours? We
haven't got a hundred-pound carpet nor all the fal-dals .</quote>
   <p>Linda looked at Mrs. Batley who was now thrusting the china
noisily into the cupboard. She found herself pitying this woman, and
she lied as she said softly: <quote>I didn't notice how the place was
furnished. All that I can really remember is that the hall is similar
in shape to yours. But one thing I did notice, the floor and
furniture didn't gleam nearly so much as yours do.</quote>
   <p>Even if it had not been true she would have been bound to say it,
for there was a loneliness emanating from the other woman that touched
Linda.
   <p>As she spoke Ralph Batley came into the kitchen. He looked
neither at his mother nor at Linda but went straight to the back door
and was on his way out when his mother said: <quote>Will she do?</quote>
   <p>For a moment Linda had the awful sensation that the question
referred to herself, but when the reply came: <quote>She'll do all
right,</quote> she was forced to smile. It was the calf they were speaking
about.
   <p>
   <p>IN the living-room Shane was sitting with his feet
stretched out to the blaze but he heaved himself up on her arrival,
saying: <quote>Sit yourself here.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, no, I'll sit here.</quote>
   <p><quote>Do what he says, he's getting selfish enough.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Batley was busy now setting up a framework to the side of
the fireplace and Linda saw it was a half-finished rug. She watched
her drop a carrier bag on Shane's knee, saying: <quote>Get yourself busy,
that'll keep you out of mischief.
<QUOTE>

<text id=LOBP22>
   <p>Then he lazed back, laughing by her side, motionless in the
sun.
   <p>He used to drink the cheap, warm wine straight from the bottle.
   <p><squote>You first,</squote> he told her, <squote>I want the bottle neck to be
smothered in your kisses.</squote>
   <p>He made her laugh so much that, sometimes, she spilt it down her
dress and left a purple stain on the piqu&eacute; collar.
   <p><squote>When I'm rich,</squote> he cried, <squote>I'll buy you champagne, nothing
but champagne. You can bath in it, drink it, spill it down your dress
and it won't even leave a mark.</squote>
   <p>With these words he sprang to his feet and cried into the
swirling blue, ~<squote>I love her, I love her, I love her... ~It's you I
love, you silly girl... Anna and Hugo... Anna and Hugo...</squote> until
their names echoed and trembled to the distant hills.
   <p>He chased her barefoot over the scented grass and thistledown
until they fell panting into each others  arms on the ground.
Then he gasped for breath, his body humped and contorted as he
clutched at his own throat in convulsive agony and desperation.
Between the coughing and the retching, he begged her: ~<squote>Don't look,
Anna, please don't look at me,</squote> and she would slump to the grass
until it was over. Sometimes, there was blood even on the flowers, on
the daises which had, already, pink-tipped petals.
   <p>The days, the weeks, the months rushed by, express train-like but
with no destination, no beginning and no end. He used to walk to the
studio where he was learning to paint.
   <p><squote>To save money,</squote> he told her, <squote>so I can buy you presents.</squote>
   <p>He bought her books, flowers, bits of cracked and broken junk
which he thought pretty, and sometimes clothes. The mackintosh was
the last thing he ever gave her.
   <p><squote>For once I'm being practical,</squote> he said. <squote>After all, it's
meant to rain in England.</squote>
   <p>He walked everywhere and the endless exercise made him hungry.
She spent twice as much as he saved to appease the hunger and they
both laughed when the false economy dawned on them. She bought him
fruit, meat, cheese and eggs and together they strived to cook them
over the gas-ring in her bedroom with the help of a French cookery
book. Their faces were smudged, their foreheads sweaty, their hands
garnished with garlic and, laughing, they would decide to cook the
English way and fall back on fish and chips.
   <p>In the winter, the snow helped to hide the barrack grimness of
their surroundings. It lay like petals on the deserted garden patch
and even transfigured the limp lines of washing into dazzling
obelisks.
   <p>Hugo's cough seemed better in the snow. He would gather handfuls
off the trees, kiss it, eat it and chase her laughing and crying down
the street, hurling it into her streaming hair.
   <p>He painted her room for her as <squote>white as the snow</squote> he said.
He stripped off the sad wallpaper, almost angrily, and in its place
put up fresh and merry whiteness. She made him hang his paintings on
the walls and could scarcely believe the brilliant transformation.
   <p><squote>This is the first time I've ever hung a painting,</squote> he told
her smiling, <squote>and probably the last.</squote>
   <p>She liked best the pictures of Provence, the fishermen with black
nets drying on platinum sand, the baskets of rainbow fish which still
seemed to squirm in the sun-glitter. She liked the lonely stretches
of Camargue wasteland, wild, melancholy and mysterious; she liked the
vastness of the rice-fields, once mistral-torn and mosquito-ridden.
She loved the pictures of housewives, brawny and good-humoured,
haggling with their Midi accent over the monk fish, the grey mullet,
the tiny squid and the lobsters while the naked starfish sprawled dead
in the sun. Even dead, the colours were dazzling &mdash; silver sea bream;
slithery, bright pink demoiselles; the angler with mad antennae-like
hooks sprouting from its huge head; the gigantic turbot and the sleek,
black dogfish with its greyhound head.
   <p>When she looked at his paintings, she could hear the auction bids
and smell the fish and pebbles, she could feel the sticky salt in the
women's hair and the tired sweat on the men's faces.
   <p>Over and over again, he tried to paint a picture of Anna. He
couldn't. <squote>I love you too much,</squote> he explained. <squote>Anyway, I can
only paint fish and peasants.</squote>
   <p>He made her look sad, he made her look happy but somehow he never
captured the startling strangeness which was Anna. In the winter
evenings, she sat for him hour after hour but, in the end, he hurled
the canvas from the easel, cursing himself and his lack of talent.
She reassured him, told him the light was wrong, that he was tired or
hungry, that she loved the picture and it was more real than she was
herself. Then he burst into laughter and asked: <squote>Do you mind if I
turn you into a fish?</squote>
   <p>And, in half the time, he blotted out her likeness and brought
fiercely to life, the sea-glimmer, sunlight, fishwives and the sparkle
of salt water on sealy skin and delicate fins. His excuse was always
the same.
   <p><squote>You see I love you too much, I can't paint the woman I love,
the only woman I've ever loved.</squote>
   <p><squote>The only one?</squote> she asked him.
   <p>He looked at her through flickering lashes, half smiling.
   <p><squote>The only one,</squote> he repeated. <squote>The others were just games.</squote>
   <p><squote>What do you call games, Hugo?</squote>
   <p>Then he looked guilty like a child caught stealing an apple.
   <p><squote>Well,</squote> he said kissing her cheek, <squote>I knew them in the
biblical sense. They were nothing to me, just nothing.</squote>
   <p>Biblical sense or no, she felt sad and jealous and questioned him
closely as to their names and faces. Whereupon he swept her into his
arms and carried her struggling to the bed.
   <p><squote>There,</squote> he said as he knelt on the floor by her side, <squote>on
bended knee I swear it. The only one, it's you.</squote>
   <p>He lay his cheek upon hers, silent for a while, then he whispered
in her hair: <squote>Anna, make love with me, real love... please do.</squote>
   <p>Before she could think or answer him, he was a tangled heap on
the floor, a spitting, gasping heap, half-sobbing, half-human.
   <p>She ran out to get some water and, when she came back, she found
him lying on her bed, laughing.
   <p><squote>So I have to make do with this, do I?</squote> He held up her
portrait still wet and sticky. <squote>It's prettier than you, you brutal
angel.</squote>
   <p><squote>There's not so much of it though,</squote> she answered truthfully.
   <p>Thereupon he jumped up and said that he was hungry.
   <p><squote>And all because of you,</squote> he told her as he kissed her, clung
to her and led her away. She was glad it hadn't happened. She didn't
want to be a game, not even in the biblical sense. Anyway, he was too
ill and she loved him too much.
   <p>Her mother enjoyed having Hugo in the house, her father resented
him. He didn't like to see other people happy around him. It wasn't
his Methodist upbringing, it was just his nature. He was like a damp
cartridge; however much force or pressure was brought to bear, nothing
happened. He never exploded, either joyfully or angrily. He was
simply an unfriendly maggot that you might find under a stone. She
and Hugo had a secret language which they spoke with their eyes and
their hands, and many was the mad, snuffed-out laughter conversation
they carried on behind her father's disapproving newspaper. He was
only concerned that Hugo should pay his rent, not put French coins in
the gas-meter slot and not seduce his daughter. The third condition
was the least important of the three.
   <p>Sometimes Anna wondered if he knew that she wasn't his daughter.
But of course he knew and that made it worse. He didn't mind, he
didn't want children of his own or despise his wife's illegitimate
one. It was this complete indifference to everything, whether mental
or physical, that astonished and terrified Anna. On both counts he
was a miser. He gave nothing, he took nothing but he resented
everything.
   <p>She could recall Hugo's farewell so clearly. It was so vivid
that she often wondered if it had not occurred the day before and
whether it were not just another good-night with another greeting in
the morning. It had been July, almost three years to a day since he
first appeared in their lives.
   <p><squote>We must pretend it's for a day,</squote> he said, <squote>because we know
it's only a month and then we'll be together for the rest of our
lives.</squote>
   <p><squote>A day,</squote> she repeated slowly, <squote>but even a day without you is
a lifetime.</squote>
   <p><squote>While I'm away ,</squote> he said, <squote>you must write to me every
single day and I'll write to you. You know I can't live without you
so promise me you will.</squote>
   <p>She didn't even bother to promise &mdash; it was so unnecessary.
   <p><squote>Don't come to the station,</squote> he begged her, <squote>I'll burst into
tears and make a fool of myself.</squote>
   <p>Nevertheless, she had gone and each tormented minute had been a
tiny stretch of happiness. He leaned from the carriage window and
clung to her, unaware of the selfish noise and activity of a
boat-train crowd and they &mdash; unaware of him. He begged her, made her
swear to go on loving him for ever and never to see, touch or talk to
another man. The whistle went and she brushed the tears from his eyes
with her hand.
   <p><squote>Keep one,</squote> he said smiling.
   <p><squote>I have my own,</squote> she replied.
   <p>The train shuddered, gathered speed and was gone.
   <p>The blurred heads of holiday-makers leaned out, waving and
kissing to the platform of spectators, to the litter of squash
cartons, ice-cream wrappers and separation. She walked away as in a
trance, walking always forward but always left behind. No one noticed
her. On a boat-train station, people look sad or happy &mdash; there is no
in between. She went home and looked at her face in the glass. It
was like a mask of granite which cannot melt, break or be crushed. It
seemed to have no reason for being there at all &mdash; simply a memento of
the past. She assured herself that in a month everything would begin
again as sweetly and smoothly as winding a clock. She wrote to him
every day for a week and every single day she waited for his answer.
There was no question of his letters becoming colder, wearier or less
affectionate. There were no letters &mdash; it was as simple as that. The
postman came to know her face quite well &mdash; it was white and drawn and
seemed scarcely to exist. He gave her gas bills, butcher bills and
canvassing pamphlets but her fingers sorted through them hungrily and
she closed the door and thanked him.
   <p>She made the lodgers' beds, went to work and returned at night to
wait for the morning. After a week, she stopped writing letters
altogether and after a month she sobbed herself to sticky sleep each
night and woke to the swollen-eyed dawn. From that time forth, she
lived in the past and three years' recollection offers a sort of
companionship although it has no future. She walked down the streets
where they had walked together, went to the same pubs and caf&eacute;s,
visited the same museums and cinemas and even took bus-rides into the
country where each blade of grass reminded her of him. She wondered
if he were ill, she wondered if he were dead and suddenly she realized
that she was the ill one, the dead one, the idiot and the possessed.
   <p>Her father was glad it had all ended; her mother was too busy to
comment. <squote>Find yourself a nice steady man,</squote> he told her, <squote>not a
choking, arty-crafty foreigner.</squote> And he returned to his evening
paper in justified and contented humour, pleased that he'd been right
all along and that his day was over.

<text id=LOBP23>
<quote>I felt sure that you would like her, Bill.</quote>
   <p><quote>We got on famously,</quote> he replied curtly, finding it next to
impossible to discuss Betty like this. <quote>But tell me more about your
mother, Kay. Is all need for anxiety at an end? You must have had a
very worrying time of it, poor old girl!</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, it's been anything but pleasant,</quote> she replied.
<quote>Naturally, I was very disappointed about not having this holiday
with you, Bill. I'd so looked forward to getting away with you alone.
As it is, we shall only have a few days to ourselves, for I suppose I
ought to get back to mother as soon as I possibly can. But never
mind, it won't be long before we shall be married, and then we shall
be together always!</quote>
   <p>It was the first time Kay had ever spoken to him in such a strain
about their approaching marriage, and, somehow the remark jarred on
herself almost as much as it did on Bill.
   <p>He said hastily &mdash;
   <p><quote>It's quite a long time to September, Kay.</quote>
   <p><quote>But the time will go so quickly, what with one thing and
another. Buying the furniture for one thing &mdash; won't it be exciting,
Bill, choosing just what we like? You can't imagine how happy and
excited I feel about it all.</quote>
   <p>Bill's heart smote him. Poor Kay! He had sinned against her,
unwillingly, it is true, but nevertheless he had sinned, and however
he looked at things, he saw pain for her in the future.
   <p>He said gently &mdash;
   <p><quote>It &mdash; it's awfully decent of you to care so much about me, Kay.
I'm not really worth it, you know. You're the sort of girl almost
any man would be glad and proud to marry.</quote>
   <p><quote>But, Bill, you are the only one I want to feel like that,</quote>
she said, squeezing his arm, and feeling more reassured. <quote>Let's sit
here for a few minutes, shall we? This boulder looks very
inviting.</quote>
   <p>It had to be the same boulder that he and Betty had sat upon so
often. Bill gave an inward groan. He felt that the situation was
getting beyond him.
   <p>
   <p>Meanwhile, Betty, feeling wretched and unsettled, had collected
her belongings and stowed them away in the suitcases she had packed so
gaily before setting out for this eventful holiday. This done, she
contemplated with dismay the solitary hours that lay before her, with
only miserable thoughts for company, and yet dreaded still more the
return of the other two.
   <p>In the end she went to one of the cinemas and tried to forget her
own problems by becoming absorbed in those of the people depicted on
the screen.
   <p>It was time for supper when she returned to the boarding-house,
and after one anxious glance at the faces of the two lovers, she
heaved a sigh of profound relief. It was obvious that Bill had been
behaving himself correctly and that Kay suspected nothing.
   <p>Betty forced herself to a display of high spirits and gaiety
which she was very far from feeling, and in which she was assisted by
Bill, who, by now, had reluctantly decided that Kay must be kept in
the dark as much as possible concerning the wrong they had done her.
   <p>Kay's unusual display of affection had touched his heart, even
while it had increased his sense of despair and hopelessness, for Bill
realised that all chances of making her a really good and loving
husband were forever dead.
   <p>After supper, they all three went on the pier to listen to the
band, and if the sweet, lilting music woke Betty's heart to fresh
agony, she gave no sign. It was only for a few hours longer that she
would have to wear her mask and act her role.
   <p>And afterwards? Shudderingly she acknowledged to herself that
she dared not face what lay before her. <quote>Sufficient to the day,</quote>
she told herself drearily, looking at the sea, upon which the magic
moonlight shone with the same radiant beauty it had displayed on the
previous night, when it had so thoroughly bewitched herself and Bill.
   <p>Oh, how gloriously happy she had been during those few fleeting
moments of time! They were engraved upon the tablets of her memory
for ever; they marked for her the pinnacle of life &mdash; throbbing,
emotion-packed moments, in which, for the first time in her life, she
had seemed to really live.
   <p>The contrast between that time and this was too sharp, too
poignant. She longed to plunge into that silvered sea and swim and
swim into forgetfulness!
   <p><quote>To-morrow I shall be thinking of all this,</quote> she said.
   <p><quote>Yes, Betty, and you'll be sorry you deserted us,</quote> Kay
replied. <quote>We shall have to come here for our holiday next year and
make it a proper one,</quote> she added, smiling wanly.
<head>CHAPTER 4</head>
<head>LOVE'S ORDEAL</head>
   <p>NEXT morning Betty bade them both good-bye and returned to
London.
   <p>For one long moment Bill held her hand and looked deep into her
glorious brown eyes which held his world, and there passed between
them that same irresistible electric thrill which had signalled the
avowal of their love.
   <p>Then he had stepped back, without uttering a word, and Kay had
raised her face and kissed her friend. A moment later, the guard's
whistle gave its shrill warning, and the train started on its way.
   <p>Betty felt a strange sensation as she looked out of the window
and watched the figures of Kay and Bill diminish, and then disappear
from view. She told herself that she would do her best never to see
either of them again. Yes, it was strange  a sad sensation,
and her eyes were misty as she sank back into her seat.
   <p>So it was over at last! All that now remained was for her to
face reality with as brave a heart as she could muster. A little
desperately Betty told herself that there must be other things in life
besides love. She had been happy and content enough before she had
fallen a victim to its magic spell &mdash; why shouldn't she be able to
recapture that old, gay, careless contentment which, up to now, had
been all she had asked of life?
   <p><quote>I'm glad that Kay will never know,</quote> she murmured to herself,
as she watched the beautiful summer landscape fly past the carriage
window.
   <p>And again, late that night, as she lay tossing restlessly in bed,
she murmured &mdash;
   <p><quote>Yes, I'm glad that Kay will never know!</quote>
   <p>Even that cause of thankfulness would have been denied her, had
she known of what was taking place at almost that selfsame moment
between Kay and Bill.
   <p>After supper, they had wandered, a little aimlessly, down to the
water's edge, where once again the moon spread that shining track of
silver light which seemed to lead to some far-away enchanted country.
When they reached a deserted stretch of beach, Kay pointed to a
nearby groyne.
   <p><quote>Let's sit down,</quote> she said, and even to Bill, preoccupied as
he was with his secret thoughts, her voice sounded strange. <quote>I &mdash; I
want to ask you something, Bill.</quote>
   <p>Somehow, he seemed to know, without being told, what she was
going to ask him. There had been a brooding look in Kay's eyes, and
an absent-mindedness in her manner which, subconsciously, must have
warned him, for he sensed at once that she discovered the truth.
   <p><quote>I think I can guess what you wish to ask me, Kay,</quote> he
stammered.
   <p><quote>Then &mdash; then it is true? You are in love with Betty, aren't
you, Bill?</quote>
   <p>It was impossible for him to deny it, for a moment or two, his
lips refused to frame the words. But at last he spoke.
   <p><quote>Please let us not speak of it, Kay,</quote> he said. <quote>It was
Betty's earnest wish that you should know nothing of it.</quote>
   <p><quote>No wonder &mdash; she's too ashamed, of course,</quote> Kay returned
hotly.
   <p><quote>That's not very charitable of you, Kay, in view of the fact
that Betty has left here solely for your sake. Don't you
understand? She voluntarily gave me up because of you.</quote>
   <p><quote>You were not hers to give up,</quote> Kay retorted.
   <p><quote>Anyway, she knew that my love was hers,</quote> Bill admitted, in a
low voice.
   <p>Kay closed her eyes. A sharp pang of pain shot through her at
his words.
   <p><quote>Bill &mdash; Bill, my darling, you are not going to give me up, are
you?</quote> she cried. <quote>Please &mdash; please don't, Bill! It's only an
infatuation. It cannot last &mdash; it can mean nothing to you in view of
the long and deep affection we have felt for each other. Bill dear,
my life will be completely ruined if you throw me over. Oh, I could
never face such a thing! You are my world, my all!
   <p><quote>This &mdash; this sudden infatuation you feel for Betty will pass.
It cannot possibly last, Bill. You have not known her long enough
for it to mean anything to you. Oh, Bill dear,</quote> Kay pleaded in a
broken voice, <quote>please don't throw me over after all this time, for
the sake of a girl you have hardly known for a week!</quote>
   <p>Such impassioned words, coming from the usually calm, reserved
Kay, went straight to Bill's heart. He could not bear to see her
humbled thus before him &mdash; this girl who had promised to be his wife
and to whom he owed fidelity and respect and love.
   <p><quote>Of course I'm not going to throw you over, Kay, dear,</quote> he
said quickly. <quote>Why, Betty wouldn't hear of such a thing. That's why
she has gone away, as I've already told you. She refuses to have
anything more to do with me. She has behaved very nobly, Kay.
Listen, my dear, I asked you to marry me, didn't I? And I'm going to
do my very best to make you happy.</quote>
   <p>Over her bent head, Bill's eyes were fixed in misery on a fast
vanishing hope of ultimate happiness. Betty was right. Kay must not
be forsaken; for decency's sake he must keep his pledged word to her.
   <p>The sound of Kay's quiet weeping came to him, and resolutely he
set himself to ease her injured feelings.
   <p><quote>Don't cry, darling,</quote> he said. <quote>You are right; all this
unhappiness will pass. It will seem like some vanished dream from
which we have awakened to reality once more. You will try to forgive
me, won't you, Kay dear? It all happened before I was really aware of
it. Believe me, Kay, I'm just as fond of you as ever I was &mdash; yes,
just as fond of you, my darling.</quote>
   <p>Kay longed, but did not dare, to ask him if he cared more for her
than he did for Betty, but she knew the desolate answer to that
question. Instead she said &mdash;
   <p><quote>Of course I shall forgive you, Bill, fully and freely. Betty
is a very attractive girl and no doubt she took advantage of the close
proximity into which you were thrown. Anyway, let us never speak of
it again, Bill &mdash; let it be buried and forgotten for ever.</quote>
   <p><quote>It shall be as you wish, Kay,</quote> he answered, but more coldly,
for he strongly resented the injustice she was doing to Betty.
<quote>Let's go somewhere and find a sherry, shall we?</quote> he added. <quote>It
may cheer us up a bit.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, and we'll drink to our future happiness, Bill!</quote> she
answered, raising her face to his for a kiss.
   <p>But of all this Betty knew nothing, of course. The days went by
slowly and wearily. She was longing for the time to come for her to
return to the office. Her parents had gone to Wales to visit an aged
aunt, and most of Betty's pals were equally inaccessible, so that for
a time solitude was her portion.
   <p>She had plenty of leisure to dwell upon those vanished days spent
with the man she loved &mdash; days of golden sunshine and music and utter
happiness.
   <p>The knowledge that she might never see Bill again was very bitter
to her, but it couldn't be helped.

<head>CONCLUDING Woman SERIAL by MARGARET SUMMERTON</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY WALTER WYLES</head>
<head>the Sea House</head>
<head>Out of violence and fear love could still flourish. For now love
was theirs</head>
   <p>A MOMENT after the kitchen dresser had swung to and left us
in the darkness of the secret passage, there was a sudden, blinding
light. Ivor had switched on a torch.
   <p>Esmond grunted: <quote>Bolt the door. It'll give us an extra half
hour while either Mark or Adkins gets hold of a crowbar. Then go
ahead, shine the light backwards.</quote>
   <p>There was the long, sustained whisper of oiled metal moving, and
then Ivor stumbled over my feet. My wrists, stinging with cramp, were
free from Esmond's grasp.
   <p><quote>Don't start making a fuss all over again Charlotte, there's a
good girl,</quote> Esmond said. <quote>Save your breath. You've got a long
climb. Follow Ivor. I'm right behind you.</quote>
   <p>The steps went on and on; sometimes steeply, sometimes on a wide,
low incline, and the depths of the treads varied.
   <p>After ten minutes, Ivor had gone so far ahead that it was dark.
My head struck rock, my feet misjudged the step and I fell with a
scream.
   <p>Esmond's arm came round my waist, but there was no resilience
left in me to help him.
   <p><quote>I can't breathe,</quote> I whispered. <quote>I'm choking.</quote>
   <p><quote>No, you're not. This is the worst patch. You've only about
another hundred yards to go. Come on.</quote> He heaved me upright, and
half carried me to a point where the steps ended.
   <p>
   <p>IVOR had set the lamp on the floor. He stood over it,
visible to his waist, the rest of him a formless shadow. We were in a
cave. As Esmond put me down, I lifted my arm. I could just touch the
roof.
   <p>The air was a little sweeter but it was still heavy and my breath
came in gasps. I would have given ten years of my life for sight of
the sky.
   <p>I began to beat my hands against the slime-covered walls. I
cried out one word repeatedly: it was Mark.
   <p><quote>Don't, Charlotte. You've got to stick it out for another few
minutes.</quote> With hands that had suddenly grown protective, Esmond
turned me round, pushed the hair from my forehead. <quote>You and Mark
have got the rest of your lives to fix yourselves up. But this small
piece of you belongs to me. If you don't stay with me until I get
into the open, I'm finished, Charlotte.</quote>
   <p><quote>You've no chance,</quote> I said, repeating Mark's words. <quote>There
isn't a yacht waiting for you...</quote>
   <p><quote>Probably not.</quote> He shrugged his shoulders. <quote>But if I can
get clear, make the beach, I'll find some sort of boat...</quote>
   <p>I glanced over my shoulder. Ivor had moved a little out of the
range of the light.
   <p><quote>Why did you come in here? If you're afraid of what he might
do?</quote> I asked Esmond.
   <p><quote>He wouldn't have given me a chance to do anything else. He'd
have shot us all down, made his own getaway alone.</quote>
   <p><quote>What's he doing?</quote>
   <p><quote>Don't panic. He's clearing the way ahead. Except for an air
passage, the way out of this cave is blocked with stones and old
rubbish. After that, there's a low tunnel, one last cave... From
there, out on the cliffs, the odds are against him, not me. I know
every foxhole a darned sight better than he does. I'll leave you
there, Charlotte, and you can double back to Mark. He'll have the
door down by then.</quote> He raised his voice that he had held to a
whisper. <quote>All clear, Ivor?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>AS he pushed me forward Ivor moved into the light. There
was a glint of metal in his right hand. Esmond laughed, and in the
same second pulled me back hard against him, a living shield between
him and the threat of the gun.
   <p><quote>Just as I thought,</quote> he said shortly. <quote>My insurance has paid
off.</quote>
   <p>I froze against him, as Ivor, giant-size in that low cavern,
moved one step, then another towards us. I felt Esmond's left hand
move down to grapple in his pocket.
   <p>Then he shouted: <quote>If you want to kill me, you've got to kill
her first.</quote>
   <p><quote>You're at the end of the line, Elliot,</quote> Ivor said in a voice
of steel.
   <p>Esmond screamed: <quote>You'll have to shoot her first. Lisa won't
be so keen to have a double murderer on her hands, you'll find.</quote>
   <p>Their voices overlapped and were trapped in the echo.
   <p><quote>Lisa's finished with you. You're a wastrel, a sponger,</quote> Ivor
hissed.
   <p><quote>You never meant me to get out of here alive... Webster... and
the boat, they were a pack of lies... Mark was right.</quote> Esmond was
now gasping for breath.
   <p><quote>Of course he was right... You're going to die, Elliot, and the
girl can go with you...</quote>
   <p>The gun in Esmond's hand spat. The light was gone. In the
sudden, blinding darkness I managed to wrench myself free of Esmond's
grasp and dive to the ground. There was a tumult of noise and the
spatter of fire. Something struck my arm. There was no pain after
the first searing blow, only numbness, and sticky warmth trickling
over my hand.
   <p>For a moment I crouched there, dazed, then I stood up and shouted
as loudly as the breath in my lungs would allow.
   <p>Almost immediately I heard the scraping of heavy, stumbling feet,
a voice choking in curses, a fall that sent stones tumbling. Then
silence again, and after timeless seconds, a long-drawn-out gasp.
   <p><quote>Esmond! Esmond!</quote> The echo mocked my cry. I fumbled
frantically in the darkness, bending double, brushing the wet, filthy
floor with my hands... Then I fell over the prone figure that was
still moaning and dropped to my knees.
   <p>I whispered: ~<quote>Esmond!</quote> not sure in the blackness whether it
was he or Ivor.
   <p>He breathed the first syllable of my name. I shifted his head to
my knee. It was heavy, and when I felt his face it was wet... or was
it my fingers that were coated with my own blood or slime from the
cave?
   <p>My hands on his shoulders moved down to his chest, and then
dropped away as he gave a terrible scream. I bent my head until my
face was over his mouth, trying to make words out of the senseless
mumble that followed the cry of agony. But they made no sense.
   <p>And then, behind me, I heard another sound: slow, dragging,
tortuous. I froze, my body bent over Esmond, my hand grasping the gun
that was, miraculously, lying on the ground beside my finger tips.
Ivor was moving.
   <p>
   <p>THEN he was on me, his foot tripping over my leg; my teeth
bit my lower lip to stem the scream, and my free hand covered Esmond's
mouth. Beneath the weight of his body I willed my limbs to stay stiff
and waited to feel the touch of his hand that would tell him Esmond
and I weren't dead. In that moment my finger found the trigger of the
gun.
   <p>Would I have pulled it? I don't know, because the weight
gradually heaved itself from me. Footsteps, scuffling, uncertain,
dragged themselves away, and finally, there was utter silence.
   <p>I lifted my shoulders, eased the burden on my knees, and
waited...
   <p>I fought hard not to wake up. Desperately I clung to the
remnants of unconsciousness, burrowing in the thinning layers, trying
to ignore the pain in my arm and a voice that called my name.
   <p>But the voice and the pain were winning. A hand on my shoulder
scattered the last fragments and I cried out.
   <p>The voice said: <quote>I'm sorry, but it's time you woke up,
Charlotte.</quote>
   <p>Odd, I thought, it sounded like Edwina's voice. I opened my
eyes. The room was full of daylight.
   <p><quote>There! You'll be perfectly all right know.</quote> Her voice was
relieved.
   <p>I pushed myself up on the pillows. <quote>What time is it?</quote> I
asked.
   <p><quote>Almost ten o'clock.</quote> She glanced at my arm. <quote>You're not to
worry about that. It was only a simple flesh wound. Dr. Farnes
stitched it up for you last night.</quote>
   <p>I was still only half awake.
   <p><quote>Could I have a cup of tea?</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>Ivy is bringing you your breakfast as soon as she can manage
it, but she's all behind this morning. Nothing has been done
properly. It's all extremely upsetting.</quote>
   <p>I stared at her. The memory of the afternoon and evening before
came faltering back to me, in patches. I could feel the dazzle of the
torches as Mark, Adkins and the others reached me in the cave.
   <p><quote>Are you hurt, Charlotte?</quote> Mark had gently eased me upright,
away from Esmond.
   <p>Adkins had bent over the body that I had guarded, and a whole
world of tortured waiting passed before Adkins said: <quote>I'm afraid
there's nothing else we can do for him. Mr. Halliwell, I suggest
you help Miss Elliot back to the house. I'll follow you.</quote>
   <p>Even now, I could hear my own voice crying out, and Mark saying:
<quote>Hush, darling. He's dead. I've got to get you out of here.</quote>
   <p>I could remember nothing after that but a close-up of Dr.
Farnes's face as he bent over me, and his cheerful voice saying:
<quote>Now don't worry, young lady. This isn't going to hurt you. You're
going to have a nice, long sleep.</quote>
   <p>I twisted round, so that I could look fully at Edwina. Her face
was grey and pinched, but from the light in her eye I could tell she
was on the brink of reading me a lecture.
   <p>I cried out accusingly: <quote>Esmond need never have died if you
hadn't given him away. You came straight back here yesterday
afternoon and telephoned Inspector Adkins. How could you be so
cruel?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>SHE shook her head at me, patiently admonishing, as if I
were a child. <quote>If you commit murder, Charlotte, you must be
punished.</quote>
   <p>I said: <quote>Why did you play that horrible cat and mouse game if
you knew Esmond was there?</quote>
   <p><quote>I didn't know he was there until I saw the way that dog
behaved, that the dresser hinges had been mended and oiled, and the
attic was bolted. When that meddlesome policeman forced himself on me
in the morning with his story of Esmond being alive, I didn't believe
him.</quote>
   <p>She leaned forward, said fiercely: <quote>And do you know why I
didn't believe him?</quote>
   <p>I shook my head.
   <p><quote>Because if he were speaking the truth it meant that all of you,
and you in particular, Charlotte, had wilfully deceived me. Do you
think it's pleasant to learn that a granddaughter to whom you've given
nothing but kindness, whom you've tried to love, is sheltering the
murderer of...</quote>
   <p>She broke off, as if Danny's name was too precious to be spoken
before me. For a moment her eyes closed and then she recovered
herself. <quote>I'd never have believed you were capable of such deceit.
However, it is Mark I blame for the way you behaved. I shall never
forgive him. He's to leave this house...</quote>
   <p>I broke in on her tirade. <quote>That's not how it happened at all.
I found Esmond. Mark wanted to go to the police. I wouldn't let
him.</quote>
   <p><quote>Let him! Let him!</quote> she burst out. <quote>A grown man should be
the keeper of his own conscience, not at the mercy of a silly,
sentimental girl. And a fine help he was to you! You might have been
killed.</quote>
   <p><quote>Where is he now?</quote> I asked.
   <p><quote>Where you'd expect him to be! Explaining his conduct to the
police.</quote>
   <p>There was a fumbling at the door, and Ivy came in, breathless,
awkward.
   <p>When she'd gone, Edwina bent over me. <quote>You've got an egg. I
gave orders for it. And there's some honey. That'll do you good.</quote>
   <p><quote>I just want the tea,</quote> I said.
   <p><quote>Oh, no,</quote> she protested. <quote>You must eat a good breakfast. I
can't promise you what the rest of the meals will be like today.
Mrs. West has left, you know.
<QUOTE>

<text id=LOBP25>
Mrs. Crichton smiled at Tandy.
   <p><quote>Come into the drawing-room, dear, and talk to us.</quote> And, as
Tandy followed her into the room, and Mr. Crichton got up to greet
her, Mrs. Crichton added: <quote>If this visit is what we think, Tandy,
I hope you're as pleased about it as we are.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm delighted,</quote> she said. <quote>Marion's such a darling.</quote>
   <p><quote>And your brother is the first young man I've ever encountered
that I'd trust my girl to,</quote> said Mr. Crichton.
   <p>Ten minutes or so later, and looking like a girl who had been
very thoroughly kissed, Marion came into the room, Jock's hand in her
own.
   <p><quote>Mummy &mdash; Daddy &mdash; we &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Gently, smiling, Jock interposed. <quote>Marion, my love, I have an
idea that if my sister has had anything to do with this, they won't
need telling. But, just for the record, we're engaged!</quote>
   <p>After that, everyone seemed to be kissing everyone else!
   <p>Intermingled with her pleasure for them, Tandy felt a private
little glow of happiness. For so long, now, she'd felt responsible
for Jock, whether or not he would have wanted it. And now &mdash; he had a
grand girl like Marion to look after him, and she herself would be
free.
   <p>Free... to let her love for Granville rule her life for ever.
Long after she and Jock had got back to the flat, she lay awake
thinking of Granville.
   <p>She'd see him again tomorrow, but not till tomorrow night. That
meant the whole of a long day to live through first. I'm wishing my
whole life away, she thought, and smiled gently to herself. It was
worth living through hours of tedium, for those precious hours with
Granville in the evening.
   <p>Next morning at breakfast, Jock said: <quote>Don't do anything about
supper for me tonight, Tandy. Marion and I want to go out to
celebrate our engagement. We shan't be buying the ring until the
weekend, but tonight I want to take her out to the best dinner I can
find!</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, Jock.</quote> For a moment, Tandy felt sad, thinking that many
of the pleasures most engaged couples shared would be missing for Jock
and Marion. Dances, theatres, cinemas. She herself had never worried
about any of them, but then she hadn't grown up in a city as Marion
had. Would Marion mind? Yes, sometimes. But reassurance came to
Tandy in the knowledge that Marion adored Jock. Being with him was
what would matter most to her in life, now and always.
   <p><quote>I'm beginning to feel a bit conscience-stricken about you,
Tandy,</quote> Jock said suddenly. <quote>I'm a selfish devil. When you're
happy as I am, you're apt to forget &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Forget what, Jock?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well &mdash; if we get married &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Listen, Jock dear, when you get married, if you want this flat
I'll move out. It's as simple as that. I can go into a hostel, or
get digs with one of the other girls at the college. Or &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He didn't even hear the other word as it trembled softly as a
whisper. She didn't finish the sentence. She just couldn't &mdash; yet.
But, she thought, as she started on her way to the college &mdash; maybe
Jock wasn't the only member of the family to have exciting news this
week. Only, until Granville really told her, she could say nothing to
Jock at all.
   <p>The sun was shining and Tandy's heart was singing as she crossed
George Street that evening and made her way down to Princes Street for
the bus to the studio.
   <p><quote>You're late!</quote> Granville said almost accusingly, as she walked
into the studio.
   <p><quote>Sorry &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>So you should be, my sweet. Don't you know I've been counting
the minutes, all day, till you came!</quote>
   <p>He moved to her and took her into his arms, and the wonder of his
kiss blotted out everything.
   <p><quote>Granville &mdash;</quote> she said at last, shakily.
   <p><quote>Yes, my love! That's just to keep you quiet till I finish the
picture! With any luck we'll be through with it tonight!</quote>
   <p>She didn't bother to change. He'd finished the painting of the
dress last night and it was only work on her face and arms that was
left. She took up the familiar pose with a kind of sadness in her
heart because it was the last time.
   <p>Yet it was stupid to be sad. The picture meant something;
certainly. It had brought them together. It would, she thought, be a
symbol...
   <p>As she stood, feeling the familiar fatigue creep over her,
Granville suddenly threw down his brushes.
   <p><quote>Well, Tandy? I didn't let you see it properly before. What do
you think?</quote>
   <p>Tandy walked over to the easel and then stopped, frowning.
<quote>She &mdash; she's prettier than I am, Granville,</quote> she said at last.
   <p><quote>Nonsense. Your trouble is that you don't know how damned
attractive you are.</quote> She could see she'd annoyed him, even with the
implied criticism, and she didn't know what to do to put things right.
But it was true. The picture was of a very pretty girl in a white,
full-skirted evening dress. But &mdash; it wasn't her. She couldn't have
said where it failed, except that the eyes staring out of the canvas
had a boldness which was quite alien to Tandy.
   <p><quote>It's &mdash; very nice,</quote> she managed to say at last.
   <p><quote>Nice! That's a stupid word. I tell you it's my best ever.
I'm going to submit it for the next Exhibition in London.</quote>
   <p>She smiled. Seeing his pleasure in the picture she forgot the
doubts in her own mind.
   <p><quote>And now,</quote> Granville said, <quote>we'll go down and have a drink
and then perhaps go out for some food.</quote>
   <p>He went through to the bathroom to remove the paint from his
hands, and she sat quietly on the settee, wondering why it was that
she felt strangely flat and disappointed.
   <p>Perhaps she was tired; she hadn't slept much last night. But,
perhaps, a little of it was reaction, because the picture that had
kept them together all this time was finished &mdash; and she didn't like it
as much as she'd thought she would.
   <p><quote>Ready, my love?</quote> Granville came through and pulled on his
jacket. He took her hand as they walked to the door, and just as they
reached it, he took her into his arms again.
   <p><quote>Sweet Tandy,</quote> he said, huskily, <quote>beloved Tandy. Oh, Tandy,
I'm crazy about you, my love.</quote> They stood locked together in an
embrace which made Tandy's head swim and then they slipped down the
staircase and along the road to the hotel.
   <p><quote>A quick drink,</quote> Granville had said, <quote>and then we're going a
bit farther afield.</quote>
   <p>His car was in the garage and Tandy waited for him in the hotel
lounge till he'd collected it, feeling, as she always did, out of
place among the smart people who invariably patronised this favourite
bar of Granville's. As she saw Granville coming back, she rose to go.
A voice, just a little louder than perhaps was intended, floated
towards her.
   <p><quote>Yes, that's Granville's latest. Cradle-snatching, isn't he?</quote>
   <p>She felt the blood rush to her head. Granville's latest! Just
as if she was some girl he'd picked up and would drop again when he
was tired of her! It wasn't like that, she thought fiercely, it just
wasn't. Granville loved her.
   <p>Granville saw her expression and frowned. <quote>What's the matter,
my sweet?</quote>
   <p><quote>Nothing &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He didn't persist as, irrationally enough, she'd wanted him to.
He just said: <quote>If one of the lads has been making cracks, I'll deal
with him. But any young woman who goes around with me is apt to get
some, Tandy. That's fair warning, my girl &mdash;</quote>
   <p>His tone was light.
   <p><quote>Where are we going,</quote> she asked as they got into the car.
   <p><quote>On a tour of inspection. There's a place I particularly want
you to see by moonlight... It's there, complete, even to the wishing
well, my love.</quote>
   <p><quote>You mean?</quote>
   <p><quote>Our small hotel,</quote> he quoted softly. <quote>You'll fall in love
with it the way I have, when you see it, Tandy.</quote>
   <p>
   <p><quote>Here we are,</quote> said Granville.
   <p>Tandy took a quick breath. It was perfect. Hardly an hotel at
all really: just a long, low-thatched building, its white-washed walls
stark in the moonlight. Lit up with fairy-lights, it looked like
something out of a dream.
   <p>He slipped his arm round her. <quote>I knew you'd love it, poppet.</quote>
   <p>She went on staring, utterly bewitched. He'd been right. There
was a well, a wishing well, in the front garden. As she watched
she could see a couple standing there, hand in hand, oblivious to
everything but themselves.
   <p><quote>Oh, Granville, it's just what I dreamed of,</quote> Tandy said in a
whisper.
   <p>Granville smiled gently. This was the way to do it...
   <p><quote>That's what you call a preview, Tandy darling.</quote> He backed
the car out again and drove back swiftly in the direction of the city.
He could see the way she kept glancing at him, and he knew exactly
what was in her mind. She wanted him to stop the car, to make love to
her. He turned down a small lane, and slowed to a stop.
   <p><quote>You're very silent, Tandy,</quote> he said lightly.
   <p><quote>Am I?</quote>
   <p><quote>You are. And I'm glad. I hate women who chatter the whole
time.</quote>
   <p><quote>Granville &mdash; Granville darling &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He put his arm round her, drew her towards him. <quote>I love
you...</quote>
   <p><quote>And I love you, Granville, I love you.</quote> The words came out
with a fire that almost frightened her. Her very feelings were
frightening her now. She'd had no idea, until this moment, just how
desperately disturbing love could be...
   <p>His lips came down hard on hers and she clung to him.
   <p><quote>Granville &mdash; darling &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>My love &mdash;</quote>
   <p>At last, she struggled free from his arms.
   <p><quote>Well, Tandy,</quote> he said, <quote>you've seen our hotel. You know
it's waiting for us. When is it to be?</quote>
   <p><quote>Granville!</quote> Suddenly now everything was right and wonderful
and not a bit frightening any more. <quote>Granville darling, not just for
a little while. I mean, you see, I must wait until Jock and Marion
are married. I don't think that'll be long now. They've found each
other and they want to be together always. But &mdash; but once they're
married, then you and I. Oh, Granville, say it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Say what, my sweet?</quote>
   <p><quote>Say &mdash; I love you, Tandy. I want you to marry me &mdash;</quote>
   <p>Abruptly he drew his arm from her shoulders. Abruptly he
switched on the car ignition. <quote>Another of them!</quote>
   <p>His tone was like a lash. But what had she done?
   <p><quote>Another of what?</quote>
   <p>Over the purr of the car engine, his voice came to her: <quote>You're
like the rest of them, Tandy! I just can't believe that.</quote> He put
the car into gear, put his foot down. In silence they drove back into
the city. He said no more until they had stopped right outside the
flat.
   <p><quote>Well, Tandy?</quote>
   <p><quote>You're angry with me, Granville. Why? What have I done?</quote>
   <p><quote>Done? Nothing I suppose. It's just that I'm disappointed. I
thought you were different. Like me. Honest. Straight.</quote>
   <p><quote>What on earth do you mean?</quote>
   <p><quote>How I hate and despise the kind of woman who will only settle
for a wedding ring, Tandy. Marriage is something foisted on us by
people who like the idea of living in cages because they're too scared
of freedom.</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't understand,</quote> her voice trembled. <quote>Loving people,
Granville, means you want to be with them always &mdash; and that's why
people get married, surely, so that they can be together always.</quote>
   <p><quote>And you think a few mumbled words in front of the Registrar and
a gold band on your finger makes you more capable of loving? Is that
it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Granville &mdash; it wouldn't be the Registrar for me. I &mdash; I've
dreamed about falling in love and getting married and though I didn't
know what love was like then, I just felt that I'd want to stand in a
church, and &mdash; have the blessing &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm sorry. It's obvious we just don't look at things in the
same way, you and I. Tandy, I don't blame you for your attitude.

<head>SHORT STORY by MARTIN MAYCOCK</head>
<head>He wondered throughout the long dark hours he spent...</head>
<head>WAITING FOR STEPHEN</head>
<head>...what had come between him and his son</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY MONICA GILL</head>
   <p>THAT Saturday, Stephen was due home from the church hall
before five. His father, who was hard at work at his desk, didn't
notice the time passing and it was well past six when he looked at the
clock.
   <p>He thumped his papers into a tidy shape, lit his last cigarette,
and went out on to the landing.
   <p><quote>Stephen. Are you back, Stephen?</quote> His voice sounded through
the house. But there was no reply.
   <p>Alan was puzzled. He came down the stairs rather quickly, looked
into the living-room and the dining-room, and then walked out through
the kitchen into the garden. There was no one there, but Alan stood,
for a moment, on the edge of the lawn, enjoying the warm evening.
There was no wind; the oak tree on the allotments behind the house
was standing absolutely still. It was perfect for cricket. If
Stephen had been back from the rehearsal on time they could have had a
spot of practice...
   <p>
   <p>ALAN mooned across the grass, feeling vaguely let down. If
Mary had been home, they would have been going to the Swansons' dinner
party. That was out, and now no cricket. Alan went inside again and
stood by the bay window in the front room. Except for George Sheriff,
clipping his hedge, the road was empty. Alan stood there, looking
out, his fingers drumming lightly on the sill.
   <p>His fingers stopped drumming. A small boy in a blue blazer was
walking along the pavement. He came about a quarter of the way along
the road, and then turned in at a white gate.
   <p>Alan went out by the front door, hurrying towards the white gate.
The boy in the blazer answered the door when he knocked. Alan knew
him; he was in Stephen's class.
   <p><quote>Gerald,</quote> he said. <quote>Stephen's not home yet from the
rehearsal. What time did you finish?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not till five. I've been around at John Purdy's since.</quote>
   <p>Alan looked at his watch. It was now ten past seven. He said:
<quote>I suppose you didn't see who Stephen left with?</quote>
   <p>Gerald shook his head doubtfully. <quote>I didn't see him go.</quote> He
paused. <quote>I think he left earlier.</quote> He started swinging the front
door nervously.
   <p><quote>Why did he leave earlier, Gerald?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>GERALD was silent for a moment, then, still swinging the
door, he said: <quote>He thought they were laughing at him.</quote>
   <p><quote>Laughing at him?</quote>
   <p><quote>When he recited his poem they were laughing at the back because
Anderson tore his trousers on a nail. Stephen stopped saying his
poem. Mr. Field told him to go on, but he just stood there. And
then he walked off the stage. He went out by the side door and I
didn't see him again.</quote>
   <p><quote>Any idea where I might find him?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, no... not unless he's round at Cobbold's.</quote>
   <p><quote>Cobbold's.</quote> Alan repeated the name. He said nothing. Then:
<quote>Where does he live?</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm not sure. Somewhere the other side of the church.</quote>
   <p>It took Alan some time to get across to the church. He walked
round to the porch and pushed through the inner door. There was no
one inside, but the vestry door was open. Alan crossed the nave,
knocked on the open door and looked in. Field was working at some
papers. He was old for a curate. Fortyish. Alan's age.
   <p>Alan explained about Stephen being late and Field said he hadn't
realised that Stephen had left before the others.
   <p><quote>He muffed some of his lines this afternoon, Mr. Deane. That
probably upset him a bit. But don't worry. <quote>He'll be back for
supper.</quote>
   <p><quote>I hope so,</quote> Alan said. <quote>Mary's visiting her sister. If
Stephen's not home when she gets back I just don't know what she'll
do.</quote>
   <p>For a while it was quiet in the room. Then Alan asked Field if
he knew where a boy named Cobbold lived. Field delved into a card
index and came up with the address.
   <p>
   <p>HE wrote it on a slip of paper. <quote>Is young Cobbold a
friend of your lad then?</quote>
   <p>Alan shrugged. <quote>If it's the boy I'm thinking of, Stephen
brought him round once. Just the once. I had to put my foot down
there.</quote> He turned to go. <quote>Mr. Deane.</quote>
   <p>Alan turned.
   <p><quote>Mr. Deane, why did Stephen decide to take part in the
concert? He doesn't really like that sort of thing, you know.</quote>
   <p>Alan did not reply at once. At last he said: <quote>Some people
leave it to others, Mr. Field. And some people get down to the job
themselves. I've always buckled down to it.</quote>
   <p><quote>And Stephen, he feels the same?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>ALAN nodded. <quote>I believe in training,</quote> he said, and
moved away across the nave. He was back at the porch when he heard a
step behind him. It was Field again.
   <p><quote>You go down to this Cobbold boy,</quote> he said. <quote>I'll make a few
calls, and meet you back at your house. If I find Stephen, I'll bring
him straight home.</quote>
   <p>There was no front gate to Cobbold's house. A small van, rather
dilapidated, stood on the grassy gravel drive. Cobbold's mother
answered the door. She smiled at Alan rather vaguely and sent him
round to the back. Cobbold was there, feeding some small animals in a
hutch.
   <p>He was the boy Alan remembered: thick glasses, and rather weedy.
None too clean. He had wanted to drag Stephen off somewhere with his
elder brother after dark. To photograph bats, or something equally
ludicrous. Quite an unsuitable type of boy.
   <p>Alan didn't refer to their previous meeting. <quote>I'm Stephen
Deane's father,</quote> he said. <quote>Do you happen to know where he is?</quote>
   <p>The boy shook his head. <quote>He hasn't been round today, Mr.
Deane. Isn't there a concert or something up at St. Mary's?</quote>
   <p>Alan nodded.
   <p>Cobbold seemed to find it difficult to express himself clearly.
<quote>Is Stephen lost then?</quote> he said. <quote>Do you want me to find him for
you?</quote>
   <p><quote>No. No, thank you,</quote> Alan said rather sharply. <quote>If he
should call in, tell him to go home at once, will you?</quote>
   <p>Stephen still wasn't back when he got home. It was dark now
indoors. Alan switched on the light in the hall. Then he switched on
the kitchen light, filled the kettle and set it on the gas. He walked
into the dining-room and switched the light on there, too.
   <p>Out in the hall someone was tapping the door-knocker softly.
Alan went to see who it was. It was Field.
   <p><quote>Home yet?</quote> Field asked.
   <p>Alan shook his head.
   <p><quote>Well, I've no news of him, I'm afraid,</quote> Field said. <quote>No
news is good news, of course. I called at the police station.
They've had no accidents reported.</quote>
   <p><quote>Would you like a cup of tea?</quote> Alan asked. They went into the
kitchen.
   <p><quote>I insisted that he should take part in the concert,</quote> Alan
said.
   <p>Field looked at him across the rim of his teacup.
   <p><quote>Shouldn't I have?</quote> Alan asked. <quote>I want him to pull his
weight. The concert's for the parish development fund.</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a good cause,</quote> Field said briefly.
   <p>
   <p>THEY finished the tea and then Alan started ringing people
up. At half-past nine, in an interval between calls, the telephone
rang. It was the police station. A voice wanted to know if Stephen
was home yet. When Alan said he wasn't, the voice said a car was
coming round.
   <p>The police car seemed to arrive almost at once. When Alan went
to the door there were two men on his step, both in plain clothes.
Alan took them into the living-room; he felt suddenly cold and
switched on the electric fire. The older man, who was a sergeant, sat
down on the sofa. Alan told him how Stephen was said to have walked
out of the concert rehearsal and hadn't been seen since. He explained
that his wife was away visiting her sister.
   <p>The sergeant had a notebook on his knee. He asked for the full
name of the boy. Stephen Roger Kearsley Deane. Age? Ten
years. Description? The sergeant's notes soon filled a page of his
book. He turned over on to a clean page, and asked for the names of
boys that Stephen knew. When Alan thought about it, it seemed that
Stephen had no very close friends. <quote>He's rather a shy boy, you
see,</quote> he said.
   <p>The sergeant finished writing. He looked up. <quote>You've not told
your wife yet?</quote> He gestured at the phone.
   <p><quote>Not yet.</quote>
   <p><quote>Are things normally a little difficult between you and the boy?
Don't mind me asking this, Mr. Deane. It might help us. From
what's been said I gather that he wasn't very keen on being in this
concert at all. Do you often have rows over things like this?</quote>
   <p>
   <p>HE stared at the sergeant. <quote>There was no row. There are
never any rows. We don't brawl in this house.</quote>
   <p><quote>Trouble between you and your wife?</quote> There was no shade of
expression on the sergeant's heavy face. <quote>Anything that might worry
the boy?</quote>
   <p>There was a momentary pause.
   <p><quote>No. Nothing.</quote>
   <p>Field left about ten minutes after the two detectives. Alan went
with him to the gate. As Field drew away on his motorcycle Alan
noticed a knot of men under the street lamp across the road. One of
the men broke away and came over to Alan. It was Roy Fox, father of
the boy, Gerald.
   <p><quote>We are going out round the streets,</quote> Fox said. <quote>They're
parcelling them out now. We're going in twos.</quote>
   <p><quote>I ought to come with you,</quote> Alan said. <quote>But the police said
to stay here for Mary.</quote>
   <p>Fox was a tall, thin man with a big ginger R.A.F. moustache.
He gripped Alan's hand. Then he went back to the group under the
lamppost.
   <p>Alan went indoors. Upstairs in his bedroom he put on a thick
blue jersey under his sports coat. In the kitchen again, he looked
for his torch but could not find it.
   <p>Mary arrived home by taxi.
   <p><quote>Stephen's not come home,</quote> Alan said, pushing the door closed
behind her.
   <p>Mary sat down on the stairs. <quote>Where is he then?</quote> she said.
Her face seemed very pale in the weak light of the hall. Alan told
her how things were.
   <p><quote>Who have you checked with? The Bruces? The Smails? The
Willoughbys? The Cartwrights?</quote>
   <p>At each name Alan nodded. <quote>I phoned them. And the police are
going round.</quote> He explained about the detectives.
   <p><quote>David Forrest's mother?</quote>
   <p><quote>Field saw her. Field from the church. But none of them would
have kept him until now.</quote>
   <p>Still in her coat, Mary stood up and went into the living-room to
the telephone. Most of the people she rang had been checked already
but Alan let her do it. At last she put the phone down, went over to
the sofa and sat there hugging her coat around her.
   <p><quote>Would you like a cup of tea?</quote> Alan asked.
   <p>Mary said nothing.
   <p><quote>They seem to think he was upset at being in the concert,</quote>
Alan said. <quote>Perhaps I shouldn't have put him in for it. But he's
got to learn to mix and to do his whack.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why?</quote> Mary said. <quote>I'm not a good mixer. Some people
aren't.</quote> She had been looking intently at her hands. Now she
raised her head and looked into Alan's eyes. <quote>Sometimes you are
disappointed in me, aren't you &mdash; because I don't join in with this and
that? I think you love me, but sometimes you are disappointed.
   <p><quote>And what you don't like to say to me, you say to Stephen, don't
you? You're worried in case he grows up like his mother.</quote>
   <p>Alan said: <quote>I want to do my best for the boy.</quote>
   <p><quote>That's not good enough. Your best doesn't matter. It's
his best that is important. He has to be himself, Alan. Make his
own choices. Look how he wanted a kitten for his birthday, and you
gave him football boots.

<head>The Doctor's Daughters</head>
<head>by ANNE WEALE</head>
<head>ILLUSTRATED BY DENIS ALFORD</head>
   <p>It was like a pebble thrown into a quiet, still pool when
Daniel Elliot met the doctor's daughters!
<head>THE STORY SO FAR</head>
   <p>For three years after the death of Sir Robert Elliot, Branford
Hall lay empty and the overgrown grounds became a favourite haunt of
RACHEL BURNEY, eldest of the local doctor's three daughters.
Rachel had kept house for her widowed father, her younger sisters,
CAROLA and SUZY, and their fluttery aunt, RACHEL BURNEY,
ever since leaving art school some years previously.
   <p>One sunny May morning Rachel woke from a daydream in the Branford
orchard &mdash; she had been wondering whether she would ever marry EDWARD
FORRESTER whom she had known since childhood &mdash; to find herself being
scrutinised by a tall, bronzed man. In her consternation and not
realising he was Sir Robert's Canadian grandson, DANIEL ELLIOT,
she accused him of trespassing!
   <p>Later, listening to the Canadian's sarcastic comments as she
accompanied him through the dusty, neglected rooms of the Hall, Rachel
became convinced he was the most provoking, arrogant man she had ever
met...
   <p>At tea she was filled with dismay when DOCTOR BURNEY suddenly
announced that he had invited the new owner of the Hall to dinner that
evening.
   <p>Twenty-year-old Carola, the beauty of the family, returned home
delighted because she had been appointed house model of the store
where she worked. Tubby, fourteen-year-old Suzy was frankly envious.
   <p>Promptly at six-thirty there was a knock on the front door.
Rachel opened it &mdash; and was struck dumb. Gone was the casually
dressed Canadian she had thought a <quote>backwoodsman</quote> &mdash; this Daniel
Elliot was immaculately tailored...
   <p>The story now continues
   <p>
   <p>ALTHOUGH Rachel had spent most of her life in a
neighbourhood where even rich people wore ancient tweeds and faded
raincoats, she could not fail to recognise the faultless cut of the
lounge suit which now replaced the disreputable slacks Daniel Elliot
had worn earlier that day. She knew, too, that the immaculate cream
silk shirt and olive green gum-twill tie must have been bought at some
very expensive shirtmakers.
   <p>Perching on the edge of the sofa, she tried vainly to think of
something to say and was relieved when the visitor broke the silence
by asking permission to smoke.
   <p><quote>Oh, yes, please do,</quote> she said hastily, looking about for the
ivory cigarette box that her father &mdash; himself a pipe-smoker &mdash; kept for
guests.
   <p>But before she could discover where it had been moved, Elliot
produced a slim silver case and offered it.
   <p><quote>N-no, thank you.</quote> The foolish stammer made her even more
self-conscious. <quote>My father says you are staying at the Saracen,
Mr. Elliot. Is it comfortable? The couple who run it now have only
been there a short time. The hotel side is quite new.</quote>
   <p>He was flicking his black enamelled lighter and she noticed that
his hands, mahogany dark against the pale cream cuffs of his shirt,
were clinically clean, the nails pared short at the tips of his long
lean fingers. His cuff-links were plain gold rectangles and he did
not wear a signet ring.
   <p><quote>Yes, extremely comfortable, thanks,</quote> he answered quietly.
<quote>My room overlooks the village green. I am told that the stream
running through the centre of it has quite a history.</quote>
   <p><quote>The Goose Beck? Yes, it has. People used to do all their
washing in it years ago. It widens into a pool up near the church.
That's where they ducked witches in the Middle Ages.</quote>
   <p>He drank some sherry, his eyes disconcertingly keen as he watched
her.
   <p><quote>I imagine you were not very pleased to hear I was coming
tonight,</quote> he remarked bluntly.
   <p>Rachel swallowed, unable to meet his glance.
   <p><quote>I think I should apologise for saying what I did to you this
morning,</quote> she said, flushing. <quote>It was very rude of me.</quote>
   <p><quote>On the contrary, I found it refreshingly frank. You look very
attractive when you are angry,</quote> he added, with a hint of mockery.
Then, glancing round the room: <quote>Where is the Hound of the
Baskervilles tonight?</quote>
   <p>She stiffened.
   <p><quote>Bolster is in the garden,</quote> she said coolly, furious that the
lazy, almost caressing note in his voice had succeeded in heightening
her colour.
   <p><quote>You know, I am beginning &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He broke off, rising to his feet as Miss Burney and Suzy entered.
   <p>Rachel made the introductions and left her aunt to take over the
conversation. She was pouring a sherry for Aunt Florence when the
door swung open and Carola made one of her grand entrances.
   <p>After contributing a couple of pounds to the family exchequer &mdash;
some of which she invariably borrowed back before the end of the
week &mdash; Carola spent all her earnings on clothes and cosmetics. Every
Friday saw some addition to her wardrobe. If no dress, shoes, or
handbag had appealed to her, then she would buy jewellery, make-up or
nylons. To be up to the minute was as essential to Carola as eating
or sleeping. She pored over fashion magazines with the same
professional absorption that her father gave to his medical journals
or Miss Burney to horoscopes.
   <p>Tonight she was wearing her latest acquisition, a dress of misty
blue-green chiffon with a sleeveless bloused bodice and a flurry of
pleats from the waist. Her eyelids shimmered with silvery aquamarine
shadow and her lipstick was a subtle amber-rose. She looked willowy
and fragile and a delicious scent wafted from her as she moved.
   <p>
   <p>ELLIOT stood up, his eyebrows tilting appreciatively.
   <p>A little put out by the interruption, Miss Burney said:
   <p><quote>This is Carola, my second niece, Mr. Elliot.</quote>
   <p>Carola smiled and held out a small cool hand, her silver
bracelets tinkling.
   <p><quote>How do you do? Welcome to England, Mr. Elliot,</quote> she said
charmingly. Then, with mischievous candour: <quote>I must say you are not
a bit what we expected.</quote>
   <p>He laughed.
   <p><quote>What did you expect?</quote>
   <p>Carola sank gracefully into a chair and crossed her legs,
revealing so much knee that Aunt Florence, who disapproved of recent
fashion trends, made anxious signals to her to pull her skirt down.
   <p><quote>We weren't really expecting anyone at all after so long,</quote>
Carola said, ignoring the signs. <quote>But you are not at all like your
grandfather. He used to stump round the village with an enormous
stick and growl at people through his moustache.</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm sure he never growled at you.</quote>
   <p>Daniel looked amused.
   <p><quote>Oh, yes, he did. I was terrified of him.</quote>
   <p>She gave a reminiscent shiver. Then, twirling imaginary
whiskers, she did a very creditable imitation of Sir Robert's deep
bass voice.
   <p><quote>Really, Carola! I am surprised at you!</quote> Miss Burney
protested indignantly, her long thin nose turning pink with
mortification at this irreverent piece of mimicry. She looked
apologetically at their guest. <quote>Your grandfather was a most charming
old gentleman, Mr. Elliot, and greatly respected,</quote> she assured him
earnestly.
   <p><quote>I dare say he was milder than he looked,</quote> he said carelessly.
<quote>I believe he made several attempts to patch things up with my
father but none of them was successful.</quote>
   <p><quote>What did they have a row about?</quote> Carola asked. <quote>Everyone
knows there was a colossal bust-up, but no one knows why.</quote>
   <p>Before Elliot could reply, Doctor Burney came in and Rachel
slipped away to put the finishing touches to the supper table. She
took little part in the conversation during the meal, in the course of
which it emerged that Daniel Elliot could pilot a plane, had travelled
all over the world and had an informed taste in art, literature and
music.
   <p>By the time they had reached the coffee stage, it was sickeningly
clear to Rachel that, far from being an uncouth product of the
backwoods as she had supposed &mdash; and perhaps indicated by her manner to
him &mdash; Daniel Elliot knew ten times more of the world than anyone she
had met.
   <p><quote>May I give you a hand with the washing up?</quote> he asked her, as
they rose to return to the sitting-room.
   <p><quote>Thank you, but I would really rather do it myself,</quote> she said
politely.
   <p><quote>Rachel is the madly domesticated type. You would probably put
everything back in the wrong place and then she would have to
re-organise them. You hate things to be out of order, don't you,
sweetie?</quote> Carola said teasingly.
   <p>Rachel smiled, wondering why a passion for tidiness always
sounded such a petty, old-maidish foible.
   <p><quote>I do a bit,</quote> she admitted evenly. <quote>I'll make some more
coffee. I won't be long.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>SHE had just dried the last plate and was setting clean
coffee cups on a tray, when a dark-haired, spectacled young man put
his head through the kitchen window.
   <p><quote>Coming for a walk, Rachel?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>Oh, hello, Edward! No, I can't tonight,</quote> she said
regretfully. <quote>We have a visitor. Come in and pay your respects to
the new lord of the manor. He is in the sitting-room with the
others.</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I heard the prodigal grandson had finally turned up.</quote>
Edward came into the kitchen. <quote>It's all over the village. What is
he like?</quote>
   <p><quote>Quite pleasant,</quote> Rachel said evasively, going to the pantry
for more milk.
   <p>Edward leaned against the dresser, watching her. He was tall and
lanky, with a thin, clever face and slightly stooped shoulders. As a
small boy he had never fitted into the rowdy gang of village lads and
later, when he went to Branford Grammar School and walked away with
most of the academic laurels, his friends had been similarly quiet and
studious. Oddly, Rachel, then a pigtailed tomboy, had liked him
better than the more boisterous youths.
   <p><quote>I say, Rachel &mdash;</quote>
   <p>He broke off, fiddling with the strap of his wristwatch.
   <p><quote>Mm, what?</quote> she asked, wishing the kettle would hurry up and
boil.
   <p><quote>I rather wanted to see you tonight.</quote>
   <p><quote>You sound very mysterious. What's up?</quote>
   <p>He hesitated.
   <p><quote>Well, for one thing, I've been promoted.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, Edward, how lovely! Congratulations!</quote>
   <p>He flushed.
   <p><quote>It is pretty encouraging and, of course, my income will
improve considerably. That is why I wanted you to be the first to
know.</quote>
   <p>Rachel smiled at him.
   <p><quote>I always knew you would do great things,</quote> she said
affectionately.
   <p>And then, because it seemed the appropriate gesture and because
she had known him for so long, she laid her hands lightly on his
shoulders and reached up to kiss his cheek.
   <p>Edward's reaction was to clasp her eagerly round the waist and
return the kiss so heartily that she was too much taken aback to do
anything but submit. When, after a moment, he released her, she was
too breathless and shaken to free herself and could only stand dazedly
in the circle of his arms, trying to decide whether she had liked it.
   <p><quote>Oh, Rachel, don't you see, I can ask you to marry me now,</quote> he
said huskily. <quote>You do care for me, dearest? You will say
<squote>yes</squote>?</quote>
   <p>Rachel stared at him blankly. She had known for years that
Edward was fond of her and that everyone assumed they would eventually
marry. In a vague, wait-till-it-happens way, she had assumed it
herself. But now that he had actually proposed, she discovered that
she had no notion how to answer him. Although she was twenty-four,
she still thought of marriage as something in the future.
   <p><quote>I don't know, Edward,</quote> she answered lamely. <quote>I'm not sure.
It's all so &mdash; so sudden.</quote>
   <p>And then, as she searched for words to explain that she was
touched and flattered, but that it wasn't a question which could be
settled in a split second, a movement in the doorway caught her eye
and she turned her head, a wave of furious and embarrassed colour
suffusing her face and throat.
   <p>Calmly, his mouth twitching, his eyes brilliant with undisguised
amusement, Daniel Elliot strolled forward.
   <p><quote>I came to carry the tray for you,</quote> he said politely. <quote>I
seem to have chosen an inopportune moment.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>FOR what seemed an eternity, but was actually about fifteen
seconds, there was a strained silence.
   <p>Anyone with a skin thinner than a rhinoceros hide would have
muttered an apology and hastily retreated, Rachel thought furiously.

<text id=LOBP28>
<head>Across the Square</head>
<head>HILTON FRIARS</head>
   <p>TOMMY BLANEY'S nose was pressed flat against the shop window,
his blue eyes gazing seriously through a wisp of fair hair which would
keep falling across his eyes. He pushed his lower lip forward and
blew the strands away again and, at the same time, stood back from the
window and rubbed his hands together happily.
   <p>His sister Margaret would look beautiful in that dress, he
thought wistfully, just like he imagined an angel would look. His
eyes lit up with excitement as he dug his hands deep into the pockets
of his duffle coat. He would buy it for her.
   <p>And then, as the feel of the twopence halfpenny which his fingers
closed upon revealed the cold result of his financial position, his
happy expression faded. He gave a manly little shrug and turned
slowly away.
   <p>How much was it, anyway, he asked himself miserably. A lot more
than he had in his money box. He sidled back to the window and looked
for the price. Fifteen guineas it said, plain as anything &mdash; that was
paper money that was. He stood thoughtfully looking at the dress from
the doorway of the shop.
   <p>
   <p>ON the other side of the square, Michael Price paused in
his dictating and stared absently down through the window of his
office on the first floor of Bank Buildings. Behind him, Stella
Travis, a discontented-looking girl with a notebook balanced on her
lap above shapely crossed legs, looked casually at her long
silver-lacquered finger nails. She was fast coming to the conclusion
that she was wasting her charms on this new boss of hers, who seemed
to look upon her as a mere dictating machine.
   <p>If he didn't get on with this letter she would be late for her
lunch date, and what's more she'd tell him so shortly.
   <p>Michael watched the little figure standing in front of the shop
window and wondered what could possibly be attracting a small boy so
much in a window displaying outfits for a bride and wedding guests.
He remembered that in his own childhood he spent hours looking into a
shop that sold meccano sets, but ladies' shops never had any appeal
for him.
   <p>The child's attitude intrigued him until he just couldn't contain
his curiosity any longer. He turned suddenly. <quote>That's all now, Miss
Travis, thank you &mdash; we'll leave the rest till after lunch,</quote> and
quickly gathering up his hat and gloves, he left the office.
   <p><quote>What's got him?</quote> Miss Travis wondered, her curiosity taking
her to the window. She saw Michael cross the square and stop in front
of the shop window that had attracted Tommy, who had just disappeared
round the corner.
   <p>Michael scrutinised the window display in the hope of discovering
what had so held the child's attention. Surely it couldn't have been
the dresses. What a lovely creation in lace that was in the centre.
He supposed it would be accompanying some lucky fellow down the
church aisle soon.
   <p>A little disappointed at not having his curiosity satisfied, he
turned away and almost collided with Stella Travis.
   <p><quote>Pretty, isn't it?</quote> she purred, as he raised his hat in some
embarrassment. <quote>Some lucky girl,</quote> she pouted, and looked at him
coyly.
   <p><quote>Er-er-yes. I was just admiring the lace &mdash; quite a change
from the usual woollens we see at the office,</quote> he stammered
clumsily. Why did Miss Travis always make him feel such an idiot &mdash;
she was so poised and self-assured.
   <p>She made no attempt to move away and he said firmly, <quote>Well, I
mustn't keep you from your lunch,</quote> and quickly left her. Stella
Travis was, however, far too thick-skinned to take that as a rebuff.
   <p>
   <p>THE next day as Michael sat in his office his mind wandered
to that earnest little boy he had seen across the square the previous
day. The ordeal of dictation with Miss Travis was over for the
morning, thank goodness. Yesterday's encounter outside the shop
seemed to have given her ideas and she had been casting coy glances at
him all the morning.
   <p>It was no good. He would have to get her transferred. She was
far too much of an embarrassment for him. He would speak to the
secretary about it.
   <p>He went to the window and immediately forgot his problem typist
when he saw the little boy outside the shop again.
   <p>Tommy bent to take a ruler from the top of his stocking, held it
at arm's length and surveyed the length of it. Then, with one eye
closed, he tried to measure how many times it would go into the length
of the bride's dress. He did this several times, much to the
amusement of passers by, of whom Tommy was quite oblivious.
   <p>Michael's eyes softened as he recalled his own childhood. He had
good reason to be grateful to St. Edward's Orphanage for the
opportunities which they had made available to him and which
consequently led to the good position he now held in his firm. Little
boys, therefore, always had a very special interest for him. He was
out of his office and across the road at Tommy's side in next to no
time at all.
   <p>
   <p>TOMMY was far too busy with his measuring to notice
Michael, who couldn't help smiling at his serious little face.
   <p>He put an arm gently on Tommy's shoulder. <quote>Who's the lucky
girl?</quote> he asked seriously.
   <p>Tommy answered excitedly, <quote>My sister Margaret... I've
measured &mdash; it's just right for her &mdash; it's as long as her nighty</quote>.
Michael stifled a laugh and adopted a man-to-man attitude.
   <p><quote>Does your sister want that dress?</quote>
   <p><quote>She'd look beautiful in it,</squote> Tommy said dreamily.
   <p>Michael tried again. <quote>Is she getting married?</quote>
   <p><quote>She will be soon, and I want her to have that lovely dress.
It's just like the one she told my little sister and me about in a
story where the prince came from far, far away on a big ship.
Margaret said she would like a dress like that when she married her
prince. My sister's the best sister in the world,</quote> he finished
proudly, putting the ruler back in his stocking.
   <p><quote>Have you any money?</quote> Michael asked him.
   <p><quote>How much is fifteen guineas really? I've got 12s. 7 1/2d.
in my money box and I've got a super butterfly collection I could
sell. My dad said it was worth a lot of money.</quote>
   <p><quote>Wouldn't your dad buy the dress for Margaret?</quote> Michael asked
helpfully.
   <p><quote>We haven't got a dad &mdash; or a mum, now, mister. They got burned
when our house caught fire,</quote> he said, almost without expression.
<quote>That's why I want to get the dress for Margaret &mdash; she looks after
Tina and me, and she's beautiful and kind</quote>.
   <p>Tommy looked at the clock in the nearby church. <quote>Ooh, it's
late &mdash; I'll have to be going home for my dinner or I'll be late back
for school</quote>.
   <p>
   <p>MICHAEL was too interested now to leave Tommy. <quote>I'm going
your way</quote>. He took Tommy's direction. <quote>I'll see you across the
road... Where is your school?</quote> he asked.
   <p><quote>In Bridge Street</quote>. Tommy indicated the direction with a nod.
<quote>Just behind the station</quote>. Michael remembered seeing a small
school near several rows of houses. He supposed it was probably the
only school in the centre of the city.
   <p>Tommy pointed to a tall, important-looking building rising high
above the other blocks of buildings. <quote>See right at the top, mister,
where the curtains are &mdash; that's where we live. My Grandpa is the
caretaker and Margaret and Tina and me came to live there after our
house got burned. Margaret helps Grandpa now 'cos Grandma's ill but
she's going to get a job soon</quote>.
   <p>He paused to consider and then chatted on. <quote>It's nice living
high up &mdash; you can see all over the town, and we can hear the big burr
of the Town Hall clock when it's going to strike</quote>. He burred
several times in demonstration.
   <p>Michael thought how quiet and lonely it must be at night living
at the top of one of these buildings, when all the office workers had
left the city and were spending their leisure hours at home in the
suburbs.
   <p><quote>How does it feel going to bed so high up?</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, it's nice...</quote> Tommy smiled up at Michael. <quote>Every night
Tina and me sit by the window looking down on all the twinkling lights
while Margaret tells us a story. It's quiet and beautiful, Mister</quote>.
   <p><quote>Just like being on a ship at night, I expect,</quote> Michael said,
<quote>with the twinkling stars to light up the dark sky</quote>.
   <p>Tommy's eyes shone. <quote>Have you been on a ship then?</quote>
   <p><quote>Yes, I sailed back from South Africa a few months ago</quote>.
Tommy showed his admiration.
   <p><quote>You would love to see the animals in the Game Preserve there, I
know</quote>.
   <p><quote>Sounds smashing</quote>.
   <p>They turned a corner and Tommy pointed to an imposing looking
entrance across the road. <quote>That's where we live,</quote> he said, and
turned to wave goodbye as he crossed into the roadway.
   <p>There was a screeching of brakes and a shout and Michael was just
in time to snatch a white-faced Tommy back on to the pavement, the car
just grazing his leg.
   <p><quote>Are you all right?</quote> Michael's face was full of anxiety for
the frightened child. The colour had drained from his face. Michael
gently steered him across the road. <quote>I'll take you home,</quote> he
comforted.
   <p>Tommy had obviously had a nasty shock and Michael was just
wondering what to do with him when a young girl came hurrying down the
steps, her face flushed and her fair curls bobbing as she ran.
   <p>Tenderly she placed her arms round Tommy. <quote>Oh, poor Tommy, are
you hurt, are you hurt?</quote> she cried. <quote>You didn't look both ways
before crossing the road like you promised. I saw you through the
window</quote>.
   <p>All her thoughts were for Tommy as she looked him over for hurts,
and comforted him with loving words. <quote>Oh, Tommy, nothing must happen
to you,</quote> she whispered as she clutched him to her, quite oblivious
of Michael.
   <p>She's little more than a child herself, Michael thought, and
couldn't help staring. Her dark eyelashes lay damp and shining on her
cheeks. She smiled then and opened her eyes &mdash; blue as the sea on a
cloudless day. <quote>Come along, Tommy,</quote> she said, <quote>Come and show
Grandpa you're all right.</quote>
   <p>It was then that she noticed Michael. <quote>Oh, I'm so rude. I
thought only of Tommy. Thank you for saving him from a nasty
accident,</quote> she said shyly, her eyes full of gratitude. Her arm
round Tommy, they went up the steps together. Michael stood for a
moment feeling useless and very much the passer-by.
   <p>The warmth and affection showered on young Tommy by the girl, who
was obviously sister Margaret, brought home to Michael the absence of
family affection in his childhood. He thoughtfully walked away.
   <p>
   <p>MICHAEL looked out of his office window very often after
that and wondered whether he would see Tommy again, but several days
went by without even a glimpse of him. Miss Travis constantly
followed Michael's gaze and once she asked him if he was looking for
anyone special.
   <p>She knew now that she was being moved to another department, and
as she did not seem to be making any headway personally with Michael
she didn't mind, in fact the sooner the better and more luck next time
was her motto. She had been told she would not be transferred until
they got someone to take her place.
   <p><quote>I see that dress has gone from the window over the way,</quote> she
remarked pointedly, <quote>the lace wedding gown, I mean... the one you
were looking at a few days ago...</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh that &mdash; I expect you'll be thinking of having one like
that,</quote> he said, with an attempt at laughing it off. He found it
easier to evade her advances now that he knew that she was being
transferred. <quote>One of your many young men will be sweeping you off
your feet, one of these days,</quote> he went on provocatively, <quote>Better
mind your step</quote>.

<text id=LOBP29>
<head>A GIRL ON HER OWN</head>
   <p><quote>QUEEN STREET at last,</quote> sighed the plump woman as the
train slackened speed. <quote>What a time it's taken to reach Glasgow!</quote>
   <p>Morag Baxter gave her a surprised smile. She had not found the
journey from Oban long or tedious. There had been so much to see. So
much to think about. She had scarcely glanced at the magazines she
had bought.
   <p>Morag looked eagerly out of the window as the train drew into the
station. She was excited but tried not to show it. After ten years,
nearly half her lifetime, she was back in Glasgow. In a way she was
returning home.
   <p>No one would ever have taken Morag Baxter for a Glaswegian.
There was a fresh country bloom in her cheeks and she spoke with an
attractive Highland lilt. But for all that she felt she truly
belonged to this great sprawling city.
   <p>As an orphaned ward of Glasgow Corporation, she had spent the
first eleven years of her life in the city. But Beechwood Children's
Home, which had run on oiled wheels under Miss Simpson's motherly
guidance, seemed like a dream now.
   <p>Infinitely more real were the years she had spent in the north,
eight of them boarding out on the Robertsons' farm and the last two
living in digs in Oban.
   <p>Morag's eyes clouded as she thought about these past two years.
Nothing had been the same since Mrs Robertson died. Though time
had softened Morag's grief, it had not helped her overcome the strange
emptiness in her heart. It was as if her roots had been cut off.
   <p>Although she had a good job, she felt Oban held nothing for her.
It wasn't long before she began to think about Glasgow with a certain
longing. After all, that was where she really belonged.
   <p>So this year she had decided to spend her fortnight's holiday in
the city.
   <p>Miss Simpson, now retired from her post at Beechwood Home, had
fixed up accommodation and promised to meet her at the station when
she arrived. Everything was arranged.
   <p>As the train jerked to a halt and she joined the throng of
passengers on the platform, Morag felt a thrill of anticipation. She
had saved up for a long time for this holiday and she meant to enjoy
every minute of it.
   <p><quote>Morag, my dear!</quote> Miss Simpson, white-haired now and trim in
silver-grey, met her at the barrier. <quote>How nice you're looking! And
so grown-up!</quote>
   <p><quote>It's a while since you saw me last,</quote> the girl reminded her
smilingly.
   <p><quote>Almost two years.</quote> Miss Simpson laid her hand lightly on
Morag's arm to guide her from the station. <quote>Come along and we'll
have a cup of tea before I take you to Grove House and hand you over
to Miss Whelan.</quote>
   <p><quote>Hand me over?</quote> Morag was faintly alarmed. <quote>Is it a
hostel?</quote>
   <p><quote>Of course not!</quote> The older woman's eyes were twinkling.
<quote>Grove House is an excellent hotel for young business women. Miss
Whelan's an old friend of mine, so I've asked her to keep an eye on
you.</quote> She sighed as they paused at the kerb. <quote>If only you could
have come earlier I could have put you up at my flat. As it is, the
removal men are coming on Monday and my sister expects me at
Girvan.</quote>
   <p>Over tea in Fuller's Morag talked gaily about her plans. Miss
Simpson smiled at her enthusiasm. It was a pleasure to meet her
one-time charge again. She was only sorry she would not see more of
her on this visit.
   <p>Time passed so quickly. She could hardly believe it was
twenty-one years since Morag had been placed in her charge at
Beechwood Home. Only five months old, and tragically bereft of both
parents. Although extensive inquiries were made at the time no trace
was found of any relatives.
   <p>Miss Simpson had taken the child to her heart. She had watched
her grow into a likeable, happy little girl. It had been like losing
someone of her own when the Welfare Committee decided to board Morag
out with foster-parents in the north.
   <p>It had all been for the best, of course. A home where she could
become one of the family was better than the best institution.
   <p>Mrs Robertson already had two orphaned children in her care at
Balamore Farm, near Oban, and Morag made a welcome addition to the
family. She had settled down happily at the farm. Her schooling
over, she found a job in an Oban shop.
   <p>Later, when Mrs Robertson felt less able to cope with three
charges, Alison and Johnny Pedon returned to Glasgow. But Morag chose
to remain in the north.
   <p>She was nineteen when Mrs Robertson died. Miss Simpson had
travelled from Glasgow to talk over her future with Mr Robertson and
the local Welfare Officer. Agreeing that Morag should stay in Oban,
they had found suitable lodgings for her in the town. Mr Robertson
himself was giving up the farm and retiring to a cottage he had bought
in Gairloch.
   <p>It had seemed a wise decision at the time. Morag, bewildered and
unhappy by this sudden change in the even tenor of her life, had
raised no objections. But within the past year Miss Simpson fancied
she detected a restless note in her letters.
   <p>Now Morag had come to Glasgow for a holiday.
   <p>Miss Simpson studied the girl seated across the table from her in
the busy tea room. In the years since they had last met she had grown
into a charming young woman, with attractive, auburn hair and wide,
gold-flecked grey eyes.
   <p><quote>I wish I weren't leaving you here on your own, my dear.</quote>
Miss Simpson sounded anxious. <quote>Won't you be lonely?</quote>
   <p><quote>I don't think so,</quote> Morag replied. <quote>Not more than anywhere
else,</quote> she added after a moment's pause.
   <p>Miss Simpson glanced shrewdly at the girl. So she had been
right. Morag was unhappy in Oban.
   <p><quote>I wrote to Mrs Hendry and she's asked me out to Mosspark,</quote>
Morag went on, clearly trying to change the subject. <quote>Isn't it kind
of her? I &mdash; I'll never forget all she did for me long ago. Then I'd
like to go to all the theatres and look round the shops. I've got
enough money for a completely new outfit and &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>You will need a full purse!</quote> Miss Simpson laughed. <quote>Have a
good time then, dear. If you feel at a loose end after this week, you
can always spend a few days with us at Girvan.</quote>
   <p>It was nearly five o'clock when they arrived at Grove House. It
was a large, rambling building on a corner site in Queen's Drive,
overlooking the park.
   <p>Miss Whelan was a tall, fresh-complexioned woman. There was a
glint of humour in her eyes that seemed to belie her rather forbidding
manner.
   <p><quote>Just in time for tea, Miss Baxter,</quote> she remarked. <quote>We have
it early on Saturdays because the girls are always in a hurry to go
out. Would you like to take your case to your room right away?</quote>
   <p>Morag gave Miss Simpson a parting hug and promised to have lunch
with her at her flat next day. Then she followed the maid upstairs.
   <p>She was delighted with her room, eyeing with approval the
built-in cupboards and the small wash basin that stood in one corner.
The carpet was a delicate shade of blue, and the flowered curtains
matched the bedspread.
   <p>The tea-bell rang before Morag had time to change. She ran a
comb through her hair, applied some fresh lipstick, and went
downstairs. Miss Whelan took her along to the dining-room and
introduced her to a slim, dark-haired girl at a corner table.
   <p><quote>Miss Johnston has been here more than a year now,</quote> she
explained. <quote>She'll soon make you feel at home.</quote>
   <p>Morag smiled hesitantly as she sat down, searching her mind for
some way of starting a conversation. She need not have worried, for
Kathy Johnston was refreshingly free from shyness.
   <p>Within minutes she found out Morag was on holiday and went on to
suggest what she should do and see in town. She broke off as they
were joined by a slightly older girl with fluffy fairish hair and
winged glasses that gave her an attractive, fawn-like appearance.
   <p><quote>This is Jean MacLean,</quote> said Kathy by way of introduction.
<quote>Morag Baxter comes from Oban, Jean. She's only here for a
fortnight and &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Give the poor girl a chance to get a word in!</quote> Jean laughed.
<quote>Hullo, Morag! Nice to meet you!</quote>
   <p>Morag enjoyed the company of these two pleasant, friendly girls.
She learned that Jean worked in a lawyer's office and was engaged to
a young doctor doing his final year in hospital. Kathy Johnston was
training as a junior buyer in Sturrock's, a large department store,
and cheerfully admitted to having several boy friends.
   <p>Both girls belonged out of town and only managed to visit their
families occasionally at week-ends.
   <p>Morag found her own reserve crumbling. Before the meal ended she
had told her new friends a good deal about herself. Kathy's eyes
widened sympathetically and she exchanged a glance with Jean.
   <p><quote>Oban's a lovely place, of course,</quote> she said slowly. <quote>But
don't you find it a bit lonely &mdash; especially in the winter?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I didn't until just lately,</quote> Morag replied, colouring a
little. <quote>And I don't have to stay there, you know.</quote>
   <p>Kathy gave her a questioning glance, but made no comment.
Presently she and Jean took Morag into the lounge and told her about
Grove House.
   <p><quote>It's better than coping on your own in some flatlet,</quote> Jean
said emphatically. <quote>You get decent meals and there are no dishes to
wash afterwards. All you've got to do is pay your dues, keep your
room tidy, and be back indoors at a reasonable hour. I reckon it's
worth it.</quote>
   <p><quote>Miss Whelan's a dear too,</quote> Kathy put in. <quote>Even if she does
like to see all your boy friends!</quote>
   <p>The door opened just then and some of the other residents came
into the lounge. Morag glanced casually at them, then her gaze was
riveted on the last one to enter &mdash; a tall, blonde girl in a black
tailored suit.
   <p>She stared uncertainly for a moment, then almost unbelievingly as
recognition dawned in her eyes.
   <p><quote>Alison!</quote>
   <p>Her exclamation made the other girl turn sharply.
   <p><quote>I &mdash; I've wondered so often if we'd ever meet again,</quote> Morag
went on.
   <p><quote>That's more than I ever did!</quote> Alison Pedon told her,
colouring guiltily as she spoke.
   <p><quote>Do you two know each other?</quote> Kathy asked.
   <p><quote>Oh, yes.</quote> Alison pulled herself together and managed a cool
smile. <quote>We met several years ago when I was staying in Oban. What
on earth are you doing here, Morag?</quote>
   <p><quote>I'm on holiday.</quote>
   <p>Morag was puzzled. Staying in Oban? Why, Alison and her younger
brother, John, had lived with her at the Robertsons' farm for over six
years!
   <p><quote>I see.</quote> Alison shrugged indifferently. <quote>Well, I hope you
enjoy yourself. Now you must excuse me. I'm expecting a phone
call.</quote>
   <p>She turned on her heel and left the room.
   <p>Somewhat disturbed Morag sat down. It was painfully obvious that
her former companion was anything but pleased to see her.
   <p><quote>Strange you should know Alison,</quote> Kathy remarked, breaking the
awkward silence. <quote>I suppose you met her at her folk's hotel in
Oban?</quote>
   <p>Morag swallowed uneasily. Whatever had Alison been telling
everyone? Fortunately Jean hailed a friend at that moment and she was
not called upon to answer Kathy. Then someone switched on the
television and she took the chance to go upstairs to unpack.
   <p>She had only been in her room a few moments when there was a
knock on the door. It was Alison Pedon, her fine eyebrows drawn and
her eyes fixed on Morag accusingly.
   <p><quote>Why did you come here?</quote> she demanded as she brushed past
Morag and came into the room. <quote>To Grove House of all places!</quote>
<head>Bridging The Years</head>
   <p>MORAG shut the door. She had been embarrassed by Alison's
rudeness a short time ago.

<text id=LOBR01>
   <p>Jones, it need hardly be said, stopped that off at once.
   <p>The days have gone when foreigners copied the British.
   <p>With Jones in power, the British are encouraged to copy the
foreigner.
   <p>The foreign-made muck, which British quality goods were supposed
to be pushing out of the market, is now being pushed out of the market
by British-made muck.
   <p>Jones does not believe in quality. He believes in low prices.
He is not interested in the old slogan, ~<quote>British is Best</quote>. He is
interested in the new slogan, ~<quote>Jones is Best</quote>, and the fact that
Jones is British will, he believes, reflect prestige upon Britain. He
is not interested in goods that last a lifetime, a tradition started
by snobbish manufacturers who wanted their children and their
children's children to reap the benefit of their impeccable trading
probity. Jones wishes to reap the benefit himself, in his own
lifetime, and let his brats and brats' brats fend for themselves. To
this end, he is interested in goods that do not last a lifetime, but
which require large replacement orders to be made every five years.
<head>Foreign contacts</head>
   <p>When Jones goes abroad, he does not go as a member of any
group, delegation or coach-party. He goes alone.
   <p>Jones goes alone, secure in the knowledge that wherever he goes,
his arrival will not go unannounced or his stay unnoticed.
   <p>At the hotel, in a capital that he has never visited in his life
before, he will meet an old American friend whom he last met in Paris,
God, it must be years ago, and soon that old American friend is
introducing him to the local Joneses right, left and centre.
   <p>At Harry's Bar, in any foreign city, it turns out that the
particular Harry of the joint used to be the barman of a little club
in London that Jones used to use in the days when Joneses still used
little clubs, and this same Harry gives him the lowdown on where the
native Joneses are currently eating and drinking.
   <p>At the American Express, which is a very Jones place in which to
cash your travellers' cheques, Jones just happens to run into an old
army pal who has now got this amusing job of showing the yobbos around
the night-clubs. The old army pal takes Jones to a number of
night-clubs, most of them specialising in one sexual eccentricity or
another, to which the yobbos would not be admitted, whether with or
without paper hats.
   <p>From the fact that Jones never fails to meet contacts such as
these on his foreign travels, it is obvious that there must be an
International Jones Organisation (Interjones), whose agents disguise
themselves as barmen, old army pals and roving Americans.
   <p>However Interjones may be organised, it is certainly a powerful
and influential body.
   <p>Thanks to Interjones, it is now possible for Jones to travel
throughout the world without losing any of his status, modifying his
standard of living, or, out of sheer loneliness, being compelled to
sit in the reading-room of the British Embassy doing the crossword in
the air-mail edition of The Times.
   <p>Thanks to Interjones, it is possible to cross the Equator
either way without leaving air-conditioning behind. Chains of new
hotels, indistinguishable from one another, have sprung up in the
capitals of the world, and &mdash; without actually being called the
Jones-Plaza or the Jones-Carlton &mdash; they are Jones all right, because
look at the showers, look at the swimming-pool, look at the arcade of
shops, look at the express elevators, look at the six or seven
restaurants, one of them on the roof from which it is possible to get
a panoramic view of London, Beirut, Madrid, Bonn, New Delhi or
Copenhagen, as the case may be.
   <p>Thanks to Interjones, Jones in any foreign city can hire a car,
use a credit card, send a transfer-charge cable, or get a ringside
seat for the student riot in the course of which the British Council
building is burned to the ground.
   <p>Thanks to Interjones, Jones can now travel from airport to
airport, from hotel to hotel, from Harry's Bar to Harry's Bar,
without ever setting foot outside the Jones country.
   <p>Jones ideas are now so firmly established abroad that as
primitive states develop, it is not the Old Country on which they
model themselves, but the New Jones.
   <p>In Africa, Jones hotels spring up even as the Prime Minister
elect is being let out of prison. In the Middle East, oil royalties
are turned into Jones amenities, such as ice, big cars, and
night-clubs that would not be out of place on Miami Beach. In Brazil,
an entirely new capital has been hacked out of the jungle as a living
monument to Jones and all he stands for.
<head>Foreign visitors</head>
   <p>Interjones naturally works on a reciprocal basis, and when
Monsieur Jones, Herr Jones, Signor Jones, Jones Pasha or Don Jones
arrive at the Westbury, whom should they meet in the lobby but
Jones, only this minute back in London himself.
   <p>In this context it is worth noting that, although Interjones
maintains branches in all countries, some nations do not appear to be
signatories to the Interjones Treaty. There are nations which are
exclusively Robinson nations, such as the Dutch, the Bulgarians, and
the Burmese.
   <p>The French are essentially a Jones nation, but like to be
governed by Robinsons. The Germans are essentially a Robinson nation,
but like to be governed by Joneses. The Italians are Jones when
abroad, but Robinson when at home. The Swedes are the Jones-nation
among the Scandinavians, and the Norwegians are the Robinsons.
   <p>England, which bred the first Joneses, is Jones. Wales, from
which the Joneses took their name, is Robinson. Southern Ireland is
Jones. Northern Ireland is Robinson. Scotland is Jones to come south
from, but Robinson to remain in. The Isle of Wight is a compound of
Robinsons.
   <p>Extremely small countries, such as Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, San
Marino, etc., are Robinson to be born in, but Jones to be a foreign
resident of. (This applies particularly to the Channel Islands.)
   <p>The Russians are ideologically Robinson, but throw up
Jones-deviates from time to time. All Iron Curtain countries, except
Czechoslovakia, are statutorily Robinson.
   <p>Iceland is not only Robinson to be born in, Robinson to live in,
Robinson even to have correspondence with, it is also the only country
outside the tourist belt that it is Robinson, and not Jones, to visit.
   <p>Spain is unique, inasmuch as there it is Jones to be a
monarchist, the reason being is that Jones is always on the side of
the future. Portugal is entirely Robinson.
   <p>Switzerland is Robinson to visit, but Jones to bank with. Egypt
is Robinson, but is studying to be Jones. India fought to become
Jones, but did not succeed. South Africa is fighting to remain
Robinson. Australia revels in being Robinson.
   <p>By a trick of light, Canada is Jones when seen from London, but
Robinson when seen from the United States. Within the United States,
it is Robinson to appear like a Jones. In Latin America, Jones and
Robinson live in a constant state of revolt against each other; it is
always possible to know when Jones is revolting against Robinson,
because then we hear about trams being overturned, and Jones detests
trams.
   <p>China, with superhuman effort and against all odds, remains
Robinson. Japan, despite all those paper flowers that blossom in a
jam-jar is becoming Jones.
   <p>The North Pole is Jones. The South Pole is Robinson.
<head>CHAPTER FIVE</head>
<head>TO JONES ACCORDING TO HIS NEEDS</head>
   <p>THE political pundits, the literary weeklies, the more
telegenic Members of Parliament, the leader-writers and the
public-opinion polls &mdash; to say nothing of various summer schools,
conferences, congresses and other centres of political group-therapy &mdash;
have devoted some attention to the question of who will rule Britain
in the future.
   <p>Jones may occasionally join in these discussions if the beer is
good. But for him there is no question to be argued. Jones will rule
Britain in the future.
   <p>Whether Labour or Conservative, the next Government &mdash; or it may
be the next but one &mdash; will be a Government of Joneses.
   <p>What are the facts behind this political reshuffle?
   <p>There is only one fact, and that is that Jones feels unable to
lend his allegiance to any one political party.
   <p>Tory Jones likes the idea of free enterprise, but can't stand the
idea of class privilege.
   <p>Labour Jones likes the idea of equality, but can't stand the idea
of regimentation.
   <p>The Labour Party, as we know, is in decline. What we may not
know is that the Tory Party is also in decline. The Jones Party is
slowly emerging, composed of the Jones-elements from both these
declining bodies.
   <p>Already Jones has established his position in both camps.
There are Labour Joneses and there are Tory Joneses in power today.
(There are no Liberal or Communist Joneses, since Jones is not
interested in causes but in politics.) The Labour Joneses write for
Tory papers. The Tory Joneses write for Socialist papers. The two
Joneses, Labour and Tory, appear on the same television programmes and
unite against trade union Robinsons from the Left Wing and backwoods
Robinsons from the Right Wing.
   <p>Between them, Labour Jones and Tory Jones are forging a new
policy. And that policy will be the Jones Policy for Britain.
<head>Why you should vote for Jones</head>
   <p>At present, Robinson has a clear majority in the House of
Commons. Robinson M.P.s go about on buses, hold dreary clinics
in their constituencies, ask dreary questions about peat, and go on
dreary fact-finding missions to dreary countries on either side of the
Iron Curtain.
   <p>What, in contrast to this, has Jones got to offer? Why will
Jones make a better Member of Parliament than Robinson?
   <p>(a) Jones does not waste time on dreary routine. Everything
he touches he makes exciting, and he is able to create enthusiasm,
which helps the electorate no end.
   <p>(b) Jones is in touch. Where other politicians have to
consult polls, statistics, graphs, fortune-tellers, to find out what
people think, Jones trusts his instinct and is always right.
   <p>(c) Jones lives in the present. He will cheerfully agree
that his party has a shocking record, for his party's past history is
of not the slightest interest to him. Neither does he make sweeping
promises for the vague future. If Jones says he is going to do
something, he means tomorrow.
   <p>(d) Jones has the gift of the gab.
   <p>(e) Jones is a good mixer. It is only on the Jones level
that Tories and Socialists can mix as equals, and consequently he is
able to avoid all those unprofitable stalemates that politicians are
always running into.
   <p>(f) Jones is very good on television.
   <p>(g) Jones is always positive. He would rather be a supporter
than an opposer, and he will always endorse good ideas, whichever side
they come from.
   <p>(h) Jones knows all about images, and in fact invented them.
   <p>(i) Jones is always ready to re-think.
   <p>(j) Jones is very good at inventing slogans. And the slogan
of the Jones Party might well be:
<head>WHAT'S GOOD FOR JONES IS GOOD FOR BRITAIN</head>
<head>The Future Jones Offers You</head>
   <p>The Joneses, Socialist and Tory alike, believe in an
egalitarian society (within the limits of the Jones Practical
Democracy, outlined on pp. 83-87), where the best brains (i.e.
Jones) rise to the top, but where there is wealth and opportunity for
all.
   <p>Jones has no wish for Britain to be a major power, so long as she
can hold first place in the markets of the world.
   <p>He is all for co-existence, peace in our lifetime, and anything
that might come under the heading of progress.
   <p>He is against outmoded traditions, gunboat-diplomacy, and
monopolies.
   <p>He would take the tax off coloured refrigerators.
   <p>Let us examine in detail some of the Jones Policies for Britain:
<head>1. THE JONES FISCAL POLICY</head>
   <p>There will be no significant fall in income tax, since Jones
does not, in fact, object to paying income tax.

<text id=LOBR02>
He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions drawn between
ordinary wage-earners and those self-employed. By the time his
monthly salary arrived, the Inland Revenue had already taken their
share, and there were precious few reductions in tax save for wives,
children, life-insurances or any of the other normal encumbrances
which Cecil had so far avoided. He read the film star's sorry story
and frowned at the provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only
allowed her to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases, but also
postponed demanding the tax until her financial year was ended,
audited and agreed by the Inspector. The process could, and often did
take several years. At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake had
claimed tax relief on the purchase of several mink coats which, it
seemed, were necessary to further her career. Alternatively, it was
reported, she tearfully claimed that the warm coats were heating
appliances and therefore susceptible to a depreciation tax allowance
as plant and machinery. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue wisely
refrained from asking how she paid for the mink coats but demanded a
receipt instead. Between all the interested parties, the final
agreement had been delayed long enough for Miss Cheesecake to spend
all the money which by rights should have been reserved for her tax.
Discounting one chinchilla jacket, a Rolls-Royce and a Sussex manor
house, all three of which were in her husband's name, she now declared
herself bankrupt.
   <p>The train drew into another station and Cecil, with a further six
stops to go, was left almost alone in the coach. He fumed as he
recollected the long correspondence he had had with the Inland Revenue
in an effort to obtain tax relief for a jacket used solely in the
office. <squote>If the jacket is a condition of your employment,</squote> the
Inspector had written, <squote>it may qualify for relief.</squote> Cecil snorted
aloud. So long as he did his job satisfactorily, Frask and Kitsell
Ltd could hardly have cared less if he wore even a bikini in the
office. In fact, the previous summer, his girl comptometer operator
had done so. It led to no end of a muddle with the figures.
   <p>Then there was that long wrangle with the Inland Revenue over
travelling expenses. The journey from Bank to Norbiton took a large
slice out of Cecil's surplus spending power. He had tried to obtain
tax relief for that too, only to be told that journeys from home to
work did not qualify for relief. So Cecil had pursued the matter on
the grounds that he took his work home and, for a week or more, he
took a bundle of record-cards each night in the hope that a passing
Inspector might see it. The final word, as always, came from the
Inland Revenue who fell back once more upon the <squote>condition of
employment</squote> clause.
   <p>Again Cecil glared at Miss Cheesecake who was not only allowed
travelling expenses but was also allowed to buy herself a Rolls-Royce
<squote>on the Tax</squote>. No wonder she could not pay up; one half of her
money seemed to have gone into purchases designed to defray the tax
incurred by the other half which was, in any case, earmarked for
normal living expenses such as publicity parties, beauty treatment and
frequent foreign holidays to the right places.
   <p>The train drew to a halt. Cecil's sole companion, the
parcel-laden housewife, staggered to the door and prepared to alight.
<squote>Madam!</squote> he called after her. <squote>You've left your briefcase.</squote>
His public duty performed, he pointed at the seat opposite without
making any effort to hand it to her.
   <p>The housewife turned a baleful eye and gazed at him over a large
hat-box which, to judge from the Bond Street label, had taken a large
bite out of her husband's taxable income. <squote>It's not mine. I wasn't
sitting there.</squote> She blinked disdainfully at him and stepped out.
   <p>It was a new briefcase, and as the train jogged along the shiny
clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil. He wondered what it contained.
Probably the remains of someone's lunch or a few secret files. He
smiled at his own joke. Of course, it might be holding wads of five
pound notes earned on the black market, if there was still such a
thing as a black market. It might be a shady cash deal though,
specially designed to avoid passing through the books. Perhaps the
case belonged to one of those fellows who were organising those girls
who operated from cars. There could be a lot of money in the
call-girl racket, and not many expenses either, just a telephone, some
wear and tear on the girls and a change of address from time to time.
The briefcase must be crammed with money.
   <p>Cecil realised that four minutes of solitary running time
separated him from the next stop, his home station and, after an
unnecessary glance around, he stepped across the car and tried to open
the briefcase. It was locked. Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
when he shook the case there was a rustling thud of wads of paper.
<squote>Cor!</squote> he muttered aloud, <squote>there's five thousand at least.</squote>
   <p>He felt in his jacket pocket and pulled out a key ring. In
succession he tried his own briefcase key, a suitcase key and a device
designed to lock typewriters. Cecil searched in his pockets once more
and came up with two paper-clips. After a few seconds of twisting, he
roughly thrust a bent wire loop into the lock and waggled it around
vigorously. There was a click and the briefcase opened.
   <p>Cecil thrust an eager hand inside, his fingers groping after wads
of five pound notes. They closed on a single bundle and, fumbling
with nervous excitement, he pulled it out. His eye rested on a wad of
stiff white paper printed on one side. <squote>Old fashioned fivers!</squote> he
muttered again, and tried to recall if they were still legal tender.
Surely the Gov<hi>r</hi>. and Comp<hi>a</hi>. of the Bank of England
would never break their promise to pay on rude demand, let alone on
polite request. Cecil frowned in disappointment as he focussed upon
the printing to find no Gov<hi>r</hi>., no Comp<hi>a</hi>., in fact no
five pound notes at all. He was holding a paper booklet, the top
sheet of which bore, in large Baskerville type, the words
   <p>METROPOLITAN MONOTECHNIC INSTITUTE
   <p>ADVANCED ACCOUNTANCY
   <p>COURSE NO. 3.
   <p>He ruffled the sheets irritably and glowered at his own breach
of social morality. There are few people who would not jump at an
opportunity to rationalise away the theft of a briefcase full of
illicit fivers, but to sell one's soul for a handful of lecture notes
presented quite a different kettle of metaphysics.
   <p>The train slowed down for Norbiton station and Cecil hastily
repacked the briefcase. There was a hiss of opening doors and Cecil
carried his conscience out upon the platform. He climbed the stairs,
eager to unload the guilt-symbol upon the ticket-collector and then to
emerge carrying his shame unseen, but burning, into the night.
   <p>He reached the barrier and fumbled for his contract before
thrusting the briefcase at the ticket-collector with the firm
intention of playing the dutiful citizen retrieving lost property.
Before he could open his mouth, the collector stretched out a hand.
<squote>Watch your step there, sir! Your briefcase is hanging open.
You'll have someone shoving their hot little hands inside. Here,
I'll do it.</squote> The collector pressed the twinkling catch home with a
click.
   <p>Cecil, irretrievably laden with both briefcase and conscience,
stumbled away into the darkness.
<head>2</head>
   <p><squote>HELLO, CECIL. HAD a busy day?</squote> His mother came into the
hall as he opened the front door. He nodded irritably and, turning
his back to her, contrived to slide the briefcase into hiding between
the do-it-yourself cupboard and the polished brass fourteen-pounder
shell-case which served respectively as coat cupboard and umbrella
stand.
   <p><squote>You're later than usual, aren't you?</squote> His mother tidied her
grey hair in the hall-mirror they had once obtained as a free gift in
exchange for the labels from half a hundredweight of Trunk and Greppes
Tannin-free Tea. Cecil shook his head and hung up his raincoat and
hat inside the cupboard. <squote>Aren't you going to say hello?</squote> His
mother stood and faced him with a smile. <squote>I've got some lamb chops
for you this evening.</squote>
   <p><squote>Hello, mother.</squote> He kissed her cheek perfunctorily. <squote>Lamb
chops, indeed. Any letters come?</squote>
   <p>She grimaced. <squote>Only the electric bill. It's up again. We'll
have to go easy on the immersion heater next quarter.</squote>
   <p>Cecil gritted his teeth and glowered at the inequity of Miss
Cheesecake well-nigh bathing in tax-free champagne whilst he had to go
easy on the immersion heater. <squote>What is it, Cecil? Don't you feel
well?</squote> his mother asked solicitously. <squote>You do look tired. Go and
get yourself a drink.</squote>
   <p><squote>Don't fuss, mother! I'm quite well and no more tired than
usual, and we finished the gin last week, you know that.</squote> Cecil
stepped towards the dining room.
   <p><squote>I'm sure you must be tired,</squote> his mother insisted. <squote>You're
very irritable, anyway.</squote>
   <p><squote>I'm NOT tired and I'm NOT irritable.</squote>
   <p><squote>Very well then.</squote> His mother nodded with understanding.
   <p><squote>You're not tired. Nobody's tired. Now just you run along
upstairs and wash your hands whilst I get dinner ready.</squote> Cecil
wriggled irritably under the misplaced management of a mother who had
failed to realise that a son who is nearly bald is no longer a baby.
He started to climb the stairs, stamping with unnecessary vigour upon
the treads. <squote>And don't wipe the dirt off on the towel like you did
yesterday. Your Auntie Edie's coming in for a cup of tea later and
you know how she has a good look round everywhere.</squote>
   <p>There was a tinkle and a thud from beside the coat cupboard.
Cecil's mother turned around in time to see the briefcase collapse
against the brass umbrella stand. <squote>Well now!</squote> She hurried towards
it and picked it up. <squote>What have we here? A new briefcase! So
THAT'S what it's all about.</squote>
   <p>Cecil halted in mid-step near the top of the stairs and clenched
his fists. <squote>So that's what WHAT'S all about?</squote> he hissed
without turning round.
   <p>She pointed to the briefcase. <squote>So that's why you are so
irritable. You thought that I'd think you'd been extravagant.</squote>
   <p><squote>But I'm NOT irritable!</squote> He rushed down the stairs and,
snatching the case, ran back upstairs with it. <squote>And I've NOT
been extravagant.</squote>
   <p><quote>Naughty!</squote> she called after him. <squote>Mother knows her boy
better than he does himself.</squote> She smiled at herself in the mirror
and reflected how mothers always know their dear impulsive boys better
than anyone &mdash; especially better than not so dear, not so impulsive
daughters-in-law. Her smile faded at the thought of female
competition, but brightened again in the belief that her son was not
cut out for that sort of nonsense. Widowed mothers often expect their
only sons to be very lone rangers.
   <p>Dinner was taken as usual before the television. Cecil's mother
had arranged the receiver to face two armchairs by the fire. They sat
uncomfortably hunched in mutual inclination, and ate at arm's length
from a common occasional table placed opposite their adjacent knees.
In the days when he had still a liking for cigarettes, Cecil had
well-nigh proved the statistical relationship between them and lung
cancer in an effort to obtain the table free by smoking his way into a
collection of six hundred gift tokens. The flush of achievement had
long passed and as Cecil sat, eyes on the television screen, not even
the napkin tucked into his neck could prevent lamb-chop gravy from
carelessly bespattering the table he had risked so much to obtain.
   <p>Mother and son gazed in fascination at the story, unfolding
before their eyes, of corn cultivation in Capokoland. <squote>What time's
the Olde Tyme Dancing on?</squote> she asked absently. <squote>My goodness,
look at those women planting things, isn't it primitive?</squote>
   <p><squote>About ten-o'clock, I suppose, the Olde Tyme stuff.</squote>

<text id=LOBR03>
He did, however, give her the name and address of a very good
lawyer who had got him an injunction to restrain a firm from
publishing a book until the author had removed a passage attacking him
for some slander which had been, in fact, a case of Privilege.
   <p>
   <p>In spite of all the transferred maternity she was endowed with by
her patients, poor Serena was an infant-in-arms as a buyer of
property. No, not even an infant-in-arms but a new-born babe, a
premature piece of frailty in an oxygen-tent of utter innocence.
   <p>The complexity of that innocence was colossal. It had layer
after layer of illusion to be peeled off and replaced with sad
knowledgeability. It was a nakedness of nai"vety to be clothed leaf
by leaf with the disappointment of experience.
   <p>Her first illusion consisted in the belief that all she need do
was to go to an agent, visit half a dozen houses in one day, choose
one, make an offer, put it in the hands of a lawyer and go away on her
holiday while the whole transaction was put through. At the worst,
she could postpone their holiday, if she didn't find anything she
liked at once. August would after all be a little hot for Greece.
All that mattered was moving. For quite suddenly she couldn't stand
their flat any more. She must come back to something new, even if it
meant shortening their trip abroad or taking an extra week off to get
settled in.
   <p>She soon found that Tom Stevens was right about the prices,
whatever their cause. The market, moreover, seemed more like one of
her graph representations of a psychotic's dream world than a rational
state of affairs carefully calculated by a handful of wicked
speculators, though she supposed that these latter might well be the
chosen instruments of the city's collective unconscious. For the
prices of houses bore no relation whatsoever to their size, beauty, or
convenience, only to some lunatic hierarchy of districts by which any
area, however traffic-ridden, that could by any considerable wrench of
the imagination be called a Village, was also the most plutocratic in
its price-range; that is, any piece of town with one pretty street,
square, corner, stretch of river, bit of heath, common or park, round
which lesser, uglier streets clustered hopefully, borrowing the same
name for themselves as crescents, gardens, garden-crescents, rises,
hills, hill-rises, ways and ends, mewses, lanes, groves and vales,
could aspire to and perhaps eventually earn the name of Village. Slum
terraces and workers' cottages would be bought up, sometimes by
enterprising individuals but more often by the wicked speculators for
a profitable sale to less enterprising individuals, and one by one the
black brick houses would turn white, or pink or blue, with bright
yellow doors and flower-boxes in the windows. <quote>This street,</quote> the
agents would say, <quote>hasn't quite come.</quote> When it did so, and several
more around it, the area would at last receive by way of final
decoration and of course price-promotion, the name of Village.
   <p>Second to Villages were the Best Residential Areas, where the
affluent middle class had always lived, but they were, after all,
limited and unexpandable, and now that practically everyone was
affluent middle-class, the Best Residential Areas were so much in
demand that prices shot up well beyond the range of the affluent
middle-class, and only the milk-bar millionaires lived there,
expense-account experts, some of the more successful comedians, the
odd reckless film-star, and of course the speculators themselves.
Fortunately, however, the fashion for Victorian architecture which
Mr. John Betjeman had started several decades before had caught on
at last and therefore saved the situation for the affluent
middle-class, who now had plenty of lovely-ugly to be coldly elegant
in.
   <p>All this Serena discovered, and more, but in stages. For the
first thing she did was to make an offer on a small pink terraced
cottage, two beds, two inter-comm. rec., mod. k. and b.,
sep. W.C. small back yard, newly dec., near shops and tube in
up-and-coming Camden Town Village, &pound;6,000 Freehold.
   <p>The next thing that Serena discovered was that she could not
afford to buy a house at all. And this in spite of having at last
managed to save the ten percent needed. Or so she thought, being then
in possession of what seemed to her the princely sum of six hundred
pounds.
   <p>The lawyer said:
   <p><quote>Of course you must count about two hundred for legal charges
and stamp duties, maybe less, depending on the price of the house, and
whether it has been registered. I take it you have a mortgage lined
up, then, Mrs. &mdash; er &mdash; Buttery?</quote>
   <p><quote>Not yet, but the bank would give me a loan, I'm sure.</quote>
   <p><quote>Er, yes. You have some securities, then?</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, no. Just my work. And my husband's.</quote>
   <p><quote>No ... life insurance?</quote>
   <p>Serena had more in common with Stella than she realised, for the
word security had meant little to her until now, when she felt this
sudden urge to buy property, paying off a mortgage like rent for
twenty years and then living free of expense, she thought, when they
were <quote>old and grey and full of sleep</quote> &mdash; though she hoped she would
never be as psychologically asleep as all that. All she had ever
bothered to insure was her conscious self against just such a
submerging sleep.
   <p>She shook her head at Mr. Clacton, who seemed asleep enough
himself, both in her terms and his, for it was a hot day and his
office was stuffed to its low ceiling with undisturbed books,
undisturbed files and dust from probably Dickensian times. His aspect
was as dusty as his office, with scurf from dusty hair on the dusty
shoulders of his black suit, cigarette ash down the front, an ashen
face and yellow sleepy dust in the corners of his pale grey eyes. His
finger-nails were dirty, though he tried to make up for it by
constantly paring them with the finger-nail of the opposite hand. His
voice was like his black and pin-stripe, a grey superimposition of
respectability over the original colour of his own natural vowels, the
result being somehow as ineffective, not just dusty-grey but muddy,
slimy even. His digressions too, seemed to have no other purpose than
the throwing of dust in his client's eyes, the dust of fake security,
of the fake friend of the family, like the puffs from his Gauloises,
which said ~<squote>Don't you worry your fluffy little head about that, just
lull back in the layers of my experience,</squote> as he told her how he had
saved one of his clients from buying a house in which he somehow owned
all the bricks and mortar but not the joists, which had been omitted
from the Deeds, and how he had learnt from another client who was a
greengrocer that all greengrocers cheat the income-tax by a
complicated system of unrecorded purchases which has become the norm
at Covent Garden.
   <p><quote>Yes, well....</quote> He judged that she had been sufficiently
dazzled and gave a long raucous cough. <quote>Only cigarettes worth
smoking, these. Most unhealthy, English ones. Well, now, let me see.
I think I can put you onto some people who might, I say might, let
you have a mortgage on this property....</quote>
   <p><quote>But, they're safe, are they? I mean, they're not &mdash;
money-lenders?</quote>
   <p><quote>Mrs. &mdash; er &mdash; Buttery, all mortgage companies are money-lenders.
That's rather the point, isn't it?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, but I mean &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>I know what you mean. You may trust me, Mrs. Buttery. I
think, however, that you might have to revise your ideas about &mdash; er &mdash;
the type of property you intend to purchase.</quote>
   <p>She revised them.
   <p>The little man from the Inter-Insular (British Archipelago)
Insurance Company soon saw to that. He was bald and bouncy, jumping
up from her sofa with each explanation, whether because of the sherry
she offered him or from a passionate interest in his work she couldn't
tell. When he had jumped up some twenty times, talked of premiums,
policies, tax exemptions and survey fees, worked out sums rapidly on
Inter-Insular Insurance Company sheets of paper which he produced from
a shiny black brief-case, asked many questions about Rupert's age,
health and income, even his salesman's patter failed to smooth over
the traumatic experience undergone by Serena's relatively sheltered
psyche that afternoon.
   <p>Poor Serena. In spite of the good marks she had brought home
from school she had never grasped the implications or practical
application of compound interest. She used to solve all the problems
set of course, but her conscious mind must have refused to accept the
moral shock of it all, so that even now at the age of forty and eleven
months, she still assumed that if one borrowed six thousand pounds at
six per cent, one paid back, in the end, six thousand plus six per
cent of six thousand, that is, six thousand three hundred and sixty
pounds. The meaning of the words <quote>per annum</quote> had somehow got
lost with the years.
   <p>Her second shock was the mortgage rating.
   <p><quote>You see, Mrs. Buttery,</quote> said the little man rather sadly
now, but very fast, like a comic spouting gags, <quote>the value of the
policy would be worked out entirely according to your husband's
earnings. I'm afraid we can't take yours into account at all. It's a
rule of I.I.I. You see, you might stop work to have &mdash; well,
for all sorts of reasons, or you might leave him.</quote>
   <p><quote>But how utterly extraordinary,</quote> said Serena angrily, <quote>you
must be living in the nineteenth century.</quote>
   <p><quote>Oh, but it's a very general rule, Mrs. Buttery, you'll find
that no insurance companies, or building societies, for that matter,
will allow for the wife's earnings. Our lawyers &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Who are your lawyers?</quote>
   <p><quote>Clacton's.</quote>
   <p><quote>Well, I'm damned.</quote>
   <p><quote>Now, let me see, you say your husband earns about ... yes, that
would come to ... three, carry seven, six nines are fifty four &mdash; of
course we'd have to have some sort of proof, you know, it's very
difficult with self-employed persons, carry two. Yes. I'm afraid we
couldn't raise this loan to more than three thousand three fifty at
the most. Now you could get quite a nice little semi-detached house
in Grimstead for three thousand, that's where I live, just before the
green belt, lovely and modern, you know. I forgot to tell you, we
don't usually lend any house built earlier than 1918.</quote>
   <p>But Serena was not easily discouraged. She had, moreover, a
reasonable endowment of intelligence and enough analytical training,
specialised though it was, to get to grips with the more megalomaniac
vagaries of an unfamiliar world. Within three days she had worked it
all out. It was all quite clear. Houses were too expensive, at any
rate for poor self-employed individualists like themselves, who
nevertheless hankered for respectability and membership of the new and
widespread, property-owning, affluent middle-class. Therefore they
would buy part of a house. The market was flooded with long-lease
flats for sale, on one and sometimes two floors of vast Victorian
mansions, bought up by speculators and converted with more paint than
architecture, a glass door here and there, a vine-leaf or cabbage-rose
paper on one of the walls, a stainless steel kitchen-sink with perhaps
a &pound;45 waste-disposal unit to send the price up by a couple of hundred
more.
   <p><quote>You see,</quote> she propounded to Rupert after her last patient had
gone, <quote>we can get three thousand three fifty, perhaps a little more
if we can cheat your earnings a bit. I'm sure you could raise the
rest from one of your publishers, get two books commissioned and write
them later. I've got a bit owing too. Now, I saw some flats in
Hendon for four thou, and some in West Hampstead for four two fifty,
two beds, two reception, k. and b., just think, our own bathroom.
Much more spacious than that poky little cottage, which wasn't a bit
practical really, the reception room was too small when divided and
too big when not.

<head>My Work for the Russian Secret Service</head>
<head>By BERNARD HOLLOWOOD, in an interview with Barry Normanton</head>
   <p>I HAD been working at the Council of Industrial Design, in
Petty France, for about three months when it happened. One day my
secretary announced that <quote>a foreign-looking gentleman</quote> wished to
see me about a new plastic fabric he had invented.
   <p><quote>Plastics, schmastics!</quote> I said. <quote>Tell him I'm not ...</quote>
And at that moment Mr. Rudi Smith announced himself and strode into
the office.
   <p><quote>Please, see,</quote> he said, holding up a square of shiny material,
<quote>it don't creasing, it don't shrinking, it don't ripping. I
show.</quote> He tugged at the plastic which immediately and noiselessly
split down the middle. Mr. Smith laughed. <quote>Ah,</quote> he said, <quote>I
notice you having sense of humour.</quote>
   <p>Over lunch I got to know him better.
   <p>We arranged to meet again in Toni's Caf&eacute; off Bread Street.
For recognition purposes I was to carry a small hammer in one hand, a
tiny sickle in the other, and the password was to be <quote>Herbert
Read.</quote> Fifteen years ago I was pretty innocent. You will have to
believe me when I tell you that my suspicions were not yet aroused.
   <p>Over coffee and pretzels we talked. I complimented him on the
improvement in his English. <quote>It is nothing,</quote> he said. <quote>I
perfected my speech in order to know you better.</quote>
   <p>And then he launched into a long, exciting history of the birth
of Communism, giving credit punctiliously to the work in England of
Marx and Engels, and touching briefly on such matters as dialectical
materialism, the marginal utility of land, and Ernest Bevin.
   <p><quote>You too are for freedom, comrade,</quote> he said.
   <p>I nodded my agreement.
   <p><quote>It is a new technique, evolved in the Kiev University Faculty
of Psychological Warfare. It is called brain-washing.</quote>
   <p>What Mr. Smith wanted me to do &mdash; and he was of course prepared
to pay handsomely, in pounds, dollars, ration books, anything &mdash; was to
deal him the details, plans and prototypes of the goods being
collected together for the great <quote>Britain Can Make It</quote> exhibition.
He seemed particularly interested in Wedgwood beakers, a Decca
record-player and Cooper's Oxford Marmalade.
   <p><quote>But if you think British industrial design is so hot,</quote> I
said, <quote>why don't you go ahead and copy it, like the Japanese?</quote>
   <p><quote>That would be unethical,</quote> he said, shaking his head.
<quote>Besides we haven't the manpower available for such work.</quote>
   <p>Every month for two years we met, never of course at the same
place twice. Usually it was in the stand at a football match, in some
billiards saloon or strip show. Then we would repair, separately and
by different routes, to his rooms on the eighth floor of the Sudbury
Hotel in Chiswick, where he kept a small radio transmitter and all the
other paraphernalia of his nefarious craft.
   <p><quote>To think,</quote> I said to him one day, <quote>that in a few moments
these microfilmed working drawings of Mappin's improved percolator
will be in Moscow!</quote>
   <p><quote>Alas,</quote> he said, <quote>the radius of transmission is small. The
information will be picked up by our receiver in Reigate and from
there smuggled out of the country by pigeon &mdash; first to Dinard, then to
Ko"ln, and from there by fast car to Moscow.</quote>
   <p>The first break in our arrangement occurred after about eighteen
months. He had been complaining about the slow rate at which I was
feeding him the designs of British consumer goods. <quote>Moscow,</quote> he
said, <quote>is furious. The second five-year plan is nearly up and all we
have so far are the drawings for a new cut-glass decanter, an improved
aluminium percolator, a trouser-press and a pen that writes wet with
dry ink. The economy of the USSR is becoming lop-sided.
Beyond the Urals 350,000 men and women sit idle at the giant
refrigerator plant waiting for plans. Our department store is
overflowing with pens. Stalin is livid.</quote>
   <p>And then he told me about Russia's long-term struggle to wage
economic war on the West. <quote>The bomb means military stalemate,</quote> he
said. <quote>From now on we fight for economic supremacy in the world's
markets, in the uncommitted nations. We Russians have no experience
of consumer goods. You British are renowned as the world's
shopkeepers, so &mdash;</quote>
   <p><quote>Some people,</quote> I interrupted, <quote>would say that the Americans
now have the lead in industrial design.</quote>
   <p><quote>American design is vulgar. No character. The British have
dignity and taste and quality. Please, comrade, will you not
co-operate in the interests of world Communism?</quote>
   <p>After this I visited Mr. Smith very seldom, and if my memory
serves me correctly, the only additional secrets I handed over were
plans for a new-style cardigan, a patent cycle hub-cap, a beer-engine
and some air-line cutlery. Our m&eacute;salliance slowly collapsed and
until last week I had almost succeeded in forgetting all about it.
   <p>What brought it back were the recorded impressions made by
BBC reporters of their May Day visit to Moscow. Several of
them visited the great department store, Gum, and were surprised to
find that many of the goods on sale bore a striking resemblance to
their counterparts in British shops &mdash; particularly the ball-point
pens, cardigans and cut-glass decanters.
   <p>Needless to say, I was not surprised.
<head>GWYN THOMAS</head>
<head>Growing up in Meadow Prospect</head>
<head>6 Reluctant Trouper</head>
   <p>MOST of us come through the years flanked by actors
manqu&eacute;s who placate the virus by getting hold of us from time to
time, plastering paint on our faces and pushing us into any strong
light that happens to be handy.
   <p>My own Svengali was a teacher called Howie. Over the whole
period of my youth he kept after me. I don't know exactly what kind
of a dog Francis Thompson's Hound of Heaven was but if it was
surer-footed than Howie I would be surprised. I am not sure what the
Hound wanted of Thompson but what Howie required of me was very
simple. He wanted me to act.
   <p>The relationship began in the Primary School. I was about ten.
Howie was a graduate who had failed to get a Grammar School post. He
was disgruntled, idle and apparently mad. He had a dark, dissolute
face and his main tactic was to lean against a window ledge, looking
at us from between his fingers, as if, for sanity's sake, he was
rationing the sight of us. The school's curriculum was narrow and
Howie, by the use of a silent inertia, brought it to the point of
vanishing. He was convinced that we were all perfectly able to write,
spell and figure, but that we were making a show of being misinformed
to bring Howie a daily inch nearer his last seizure. At any show of
idiocy he would shout: <quote>Nature bleeds, but I didn't go to University
to be a first-aid man. Wound it some more.</quote>
   <p>Howie was a Welsh nationalist. He swam like a duck around the
tank of tears that is fixed firmly in any Celtic past. He wrote
patriotic playlets. Howie had stared at me for a long time and he
said I had the true truculent face of an embattled Celt, the sort of
features that had looked down at the Saxons through the fogs of
Snowdon, thickening them. I tried to explain to Howie that my scowl
had nothing to do with my being Welsh or a bristling insurgent. I
looked the way I did because I was in the first stage of nicotine
poisoning, genuinely foxed in my attempts to find any hint of promise
or logic in my environment, and subject to some terrible ventral
upsets brought on by an unwise excess of lentils in the Meadow
Prospect diet.
   <p>But I played along with Howie. The play cycle he had written had
two wheels: anguish and insurrection, and I was the boy who did the
major pedalling. My first appearance in each case was as a captive
and in this Howie left nothing to the fancy. I would walk on to the
stage bowed down by chains. These were very real chains and they
slowed me down considerably. Most of the first act was taken up with
me moving from the wings to the middle of the stage, clanking and
enraged, to be told by some king or chieftain to get used to these
trimmings because they were to be on me for life. I hated those
chains. They had been left in the Memorial Hall by some escapologist
with a leaking memory who forgot not only the essential details of
trickery that would have him sailing out of boxes and sacks, but also
left his equipment behind him. In the Memorial Hall he had had
himself chained up and enclosed in a sealed barrel from which he
proposed to make his escape in four minutes. The darkness must have
put him off his stroke, or the chains were of too honest a brand. It
took two coopers or hoopers to get him out.
   <p>The play on which Howie expended the most labour was one which
showed St. David founding his cathedral on the cliffs of
Pembrokeshire where a couple of his shin bones can still be seen.
There was some talk of my taking the part of the saint and I worked
my face into a whole new set of patterns to be able to present a
picture of gentle innocence. I thought that this might possibly mark
the opening of a new phase of more tractable and nourishing
relationships with my fellows, and I could shed that iron top-coat.
But Howie was dubious. The sight of me fettered and revolted had
become one of his drawing cards, and it seemed to pull a satisfying
bristle of excitement over the dry skin of his psyche.
   <p>He enquired of a few local hagiologists as to whether St. David
had ever gone around in chains. They said no, all agreeing that David
had been a fairly limber intriguer with a way of keeping on the right
side of the gyves. Then Howie had the idea of casting me as the
sullen landlord, a pagan bully, who takes pleasure in saying that he
would much prefer to put David over the cliff than let him have the
land required for building the cathedral. But Howie could see no way
of having this landlord appear in chains. The whole point of the play
was that from the beginning to the end where he is struck down by a
miracle this landlord is a puissant and overbearing man. But Howie
worked me in after a lot of hard thinking. In the last scene the
landowner is raising a club to St. David and the saint just stands
there smiling, not even lifting his pastoral crook. In the original
version the landlord gets his quittance by some bit of intercession
from on high. Howie had favoured a bolt but this would have been hard
to stage, so he fell back on a stroke. Then he got an even sharper
idea. As the argument between the landowner and the saint is warming
up a very fierce-looking felon, chained, is brought on by an escort of
gaolers on his way to the gibbet. That was me, back to base. I ask
my captors for a few minutes' pause. The gibbet is a fair way from
the gaol and the chains are heavy. I stare at the saint. I am trying
to remember something. The memory gets through. Years before, in the
middle of some bit of delinquency I had been caught and led before the
saint. He had fed me and advised me to go straight. He had even
given me an address to which I could go and apply for some sort of
honest work. But I had been making too much of a noise with my eating
to catch the last part of the address, and in any case I was stupid
with youth and flushed with confidence. The food had merely given me
fresh strength to move more briskly towards some new bit of
crookedness.

<head>The Ghostess</head>
<head>by BETTY JAMES</head>
   <p><squote>AND,</squote> added my teenage son, <squote>we shall also need a
Necking Room.</squote>
   <p>Coming as it did upon previous requests for beer and cigarettes,
this caused me violently to wish that I had never agreed to a party at
all, in spite of the fact that my son had filled me with pride by
undertaking a paper-round to pay for it.
   <p>Catching me in a busy moment, he had asked me if I would mind
lending the sitting-room for a dance for his friends; and I &mdash; my
sanity clouded with visions of launching my boy handsomely into a
reciprocal round of innocent entertainment &mdash; had foolhardily agreed to
roll up the carpet one night and to go and do my typing elsewhere.
   <p>Owing to my son's easy-going disposition and preference for the
exotic and the modern, it suddenly dawned upon me that I was about to
meet a posse of embryo beatniks and, as the date of the party
approached and the needs of the occasion became more and more
horrifying, I began to doubt the wisdom of my agreeing. Patently, the
party was due to last all night. I telephoned a few of my more
off-beat friends and was indulgently advised to give the kids what
they wanted unless I wished my son to be socially ostracised &mdash; and to
go out and leave them to it. This, however, I firmly refused to do.
To come back to the home I had built with the sweat of my brow,
typing my fingers down to the knuckles, and to find it full of drunken
children and irate parents beating at the door of the Necking Room was
more than I could stomach. I decided secretly to buy some ginger-ale
and to creep around like Banquo &mdash; popping it into the beer.
   <p>And so... Dawn having finally flung her most ominous Stone, I
went to work in aweful prescience and came back ready to do my son
proud if it killed me.
   <p>To my amazement, I found three children already there, working
away like blacks. Or &mdash; I should say &mdash; two of them were working like
blacks and one of them (my son) was directing operations in a masterly
fashion. The carpet had already been taken into the bathroom; a
charming boy was polishing the floor of the sitting room; and an
adorable little girl, who was introduced to me as <squote>Marblehead,</squote> was
making sandwiches in the kitchen.
   <p>Apart from being touched to my very soul I was also sickened to
my stomach to think that these innocent little darlings were about to
turn into hideous, beer-swilling, chain-smoking, Necking monsters in a
very short time. At an age and time of day when, in my own youth,
Christopher Robin was Saying His Prayers, the pink and healthy chip
off my own block was probably about to sprout horns and a tail.
   <p>
   <p>OUR flat consists of a sitting room and two bedrooms.
Feeling it less of a condonation of the corybantic diableries about
to be performed by the invited jeunesse dor&eacute;, I had
allotted my own bedroom for Necking, prudently removing both the bed
and the key, and taken both myself and my typewriter into my son's
bedroom.
   <p>At intervals between 6 and 7 p.m. bunches of children
arrived and, to my surprise, I was hauled out with each new invasion
to be introduced by my son with what seemed to be a certain amount of
inexplicable pride. Inexplicable, because our guests looked at me
doubtfully, possibly due to the fact that I had not dressed to meet
anybody, since I had expected to be kept well out of sight. I was
wrapped in my usual working costume of huge and somewhat grubby red
flannel dressing-gown, I had omitted to don a face and &mdash; another
normal concession to work &mdash; had twined curlers in my hair in order to
deter my fingers from plunging wildly through my new hair-do in
moments of creative stress.
   <p>Finally, to my dismay, three boys arrived bearing musical
instruments and the festivities got under way.
   <p>I had placed the beer in a strategic position on the hall chest
outside my son's door so that I could listen for the moment when
childish thirst overcame caution and the time arrived for the ginger
ale to be wielded as a defensive weapon. For an hour nothing
happened, nobody came near the beer, and I typed away with my other
ear attuned to my bedroom door &mdash; which remained firmly closed.
   <p>The noise from the sitting-room was deafening but tuneful. The
boy prodigies might play loudly &mdash; but they were obviously able to play
in tune.
   <p>
   <p>AFTER another hour of this I heard footsteps approaching and
dashed for my deterrents. Whether in drink or deflowerment I was
obviously about to have to defend to the death the innocence of some
defenceless girl. All very well for my friends to tell me that my son
was doomed to a lonely and celibate life if I interfered. That was
before I had laid eyes on all those Bright Young Things. All right,
go on and tell me that they are nothing but disburgeoned delinquents &mdash;
they didn't look like that to me.
   <p>My door opened and a child of about fifteen put her head round
it. She looked at me for a second, wide-eyed, and then asked, <squote>Am I
interrupting you?</squote> I assured her that her visit was welcome and,
encouraged, she added, <squote>Are we making too much noise?</squote> I thanked
her for her thoughtfulness and explained that, since this was my son's
party, I did not feel entitled to complain. She then asked me why I
didn't come and join the party.
   <p>This undoubted compliment took me by surprise. I thanked her
very much and told her that I was quite happy and felt that my
interference at this stage would not only be unsuitable, but would
also make her unpopular with her contemporaries.
   <p>After I had explained what I meant she seemed flattered and
pleased but emphatically denied that parents were necessarily squares
and thus geometrically unsuited to teenage coruscations.
   <p>In fact, we had an enlightening conversation &mdash; on both our parts.
   <p><squote>Angus told me that you write,</squote> she stated, as if this fact
whilst inarguably forever condemning me to the ranks of tepid
Bohemianism &mdash; nevertheless earned for me the right of entry into any
company, even theirs.
   <p>After this she, and a couple of friends she had called to the
rescue, helped me to a pair of leopard-skin tights and a black sweater
from my depleted wardrobe and I was hustled into the sitting-room and
taught the rock n' roll , the cha-cha and other gay, if
labyrinthine, mystiques. Five of the elder boys (including the
instrumentalists, who deserved it) drank four bottles of beer apiece;
the others fell with delighted cries on the ginger-ale. The
sandwiches were devoured, and one small girl fell asleep in the
Necking Room. At 9.30 the lights were turned out and dancing
continued in the dark. I returned to my work and the little girl in
the Necking Room slept undisturbed.
   <p>Nine of the children left at 10.45 obviously with appreciable
respect for the instructions of stern, but just parents. Three boys
(one the brother of the sleeping child) stayed overnight &mdash; after
phoning for permission &mdash; to help restore order in the morning.
   <p>
   <p>AMONGST my so-called grown-up acquaintances where shall I
ever find gathered together such a charming, friendly, unspoilt and
generous cross-section of humanity as graced our home on the night of
my son's party?
   <p>Where are the profligate little terrors I hear about? Not
necessarily (as some would have it) amongst the members of
co-educational schools. These young people seem to have acquired a
healthier slant on life than have some of their more conventional
contemporaries and, if they are a sample of youth today, the
psychiatrists' couches of the future should creak much less frequently
as they get ready to bear the burden of yet another pathological
despair.

   <p>Asked at a Coroner's inquest to prove his identity and to agree
that he was a medical practitioner, a doctor replied: <squote>Yes, sir. I
am a medical practitioner &mdash; in fact, one of the best in the
country.</squote>
   <p>Ribbed afterwards by a colleague for immodesty and unprofessional
conduct, the M.D. replied: <squote>Alas! What else could I say?
After all, I was on oath.</squote>
<head>Castle Wanted</head>
<head>by JOHN HAMMOND</head>
<head><squote>Being a Top Person, it would appear, is not so much a question
of balance as a state of mind....</squote></head>
   <p>THE British character is not quite dead. That is what I am
able, and delighted, to report after devoting twelve months to reading
the personal column of The Times &mdash; that daily barometer of the
hopes, the fears, and the dreams of the nation's Top People. Even in
the 1960s, it seems, there are still among us independent spirits who
refuse to allow their horizons to be limited by the 8.15 and the
goggle-box; who will go anywhere and do anything, fight a duel, hire a
parachutist (<squote>either sex</squote>) for a special assignment, and are in the
market for anything, from a rocking horse, <squote>traditional</squote>, to a
chastity belt, <squote>metal overlaid with velvet</squote>.
   <p>Reduced to their baser elements the motives that drive anyone to
invest in a few lines of Times type are not so greatly different
from those of advertisers in lesser journals: the desire to acquire
something you have not got yourself, including money; the
complementary urge to sell someone else something you have yourself
but would sooner be without.
   <p>What distinguishes a Times Personal Column ad. is its
careless, well-bred panache. For example, lots of people in
this sad, overcrowded little world of ours suffer from a housing
problem but how different from the pathetic appeal in the local
newsagent's window is ~<squote>I am urgently seeking an enormous country
house anywhere in England...</squote>, or ~<squote>Castle wanted as permanent home
by young couple....</squote>
   <p>There is, however, a hint of well-bred panic in ~<squote>Agonized
family (5) aesthetic and practical ambitions, urgently require
Georgian (or similar) house... derelict castle, unmanageable mansion
or anything...</squote>; and perhaps an appeal to the esprit de corps
which, one imagines, exists among our Top People, in ~<squote>My husband
and I, Nanny and the children will be homeless next January unless you
sell or let us that six bedroomed Georgian country house on the
Herts-Essex borders that we have sought sorrowfully these last
two years....</squote>
   <p>Nor should one assume that money is no object with every
advertiser. Being a Top Person, it would appear, is not so much a
question of bank balance as a state of mind, and sprinkled among the
demands for ancestral homes are to be found requests like the one from
<squote>Impoverished, very junior executive</squote> in need of living space.
Naturally though, it has to be within walking distance of Mayfair,
but, apart from that, an attic with only a shower and a gas ring will
suffice.
   <p>Practitioners of the arts are to be found at both ends of the
financial scale, from the quiet-seeking writer wishing to rent a wing
of a <squote>too-large castle</squote> or mansion in the Scottish Highlands (<squote>a
library, music room, or private chapel would be much appreciated</squote>)
to the <squote>very poor novelist</squote> in search of shelter for himself and
some furniture in London, <squote>charitable offers only, please.</squote>
   <p>
   <p>THE possession of a four-footed friend is a problem to all
seekers after a roof and puts the experienced advertiser on his
mettle. The bravura of ~<squote>Accommodation for amiable bloodhound,
grand piano and architect owner sought; old vicarage? ~Disused wing?
~Help!</squote> has already been celebrated by a leading article in the
journal in which it appeared; but equally moving, in a more restrained
key, is ~<squote>Old English Sheepdog pup and Canadian Gentleman desire to
be paying guests at Farm or Country House....</squote>
   <p>However, even if the worst happens, the Top Person's dogs &mdash;
provided they are few and small &mdash; may be <squote>boarded out en
famille</squote>, in another advertiser's country residence. And their
felines, you will be relieved to know, may find accommodation suited
to their station at the <squote>Cat-a-Guest House</squote>, with <squote>expert care;
cuisine a speciality.</squote>

<head>The Voice of the Turtle-dove</head>
<head>ANTHONY CARSON</head>
   <p>Vence is a sober spot, half way between small town and village,
pigeon grey, sly with arches, and linked by a whispering plot of
fountains. In the main tree-heavy square you can sit in the autumn
sunshine, still burning like a half-cooled iron, sip \pastis and
read the local newspapers. One called La Patriote is
Communist, and at the time of our arrival it was throwing huge
over-ripe verbal tomatoes at General \de Gaulle.
   <p>One side of this square is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's
Bar. For one day, with the help of the Syndicat \d'Initiative, we had
been hunting for furnished rooms, and had given up, when an elderly
lady, the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest, had firmly
closed the door in our noses. <squote>It is a pity,</squote> said Mart, <squote>because
it would have been a good address.</squote> Now, after a woman's radar
look, she decided Pierre would solve our problems.
   <p>This was true, Pierre was a true Proven&ccedil;al, thin and yellow as
lemon peel, wrestling with some gnawing rat of an illness, man of all
trades, married to a commanding lady who loved small talk and the
discreet accumulation of money. We went in. There were a few people
in the bar, elderly, well-off, artistic, who, you felt, had made a
hard bargain for giving up.
   <p><squote>I have furnished rooms,</squote> said Pierre, <squote>and all mod
cons.</squote> The price was 16,000 francs a month.
   <p><squote>Yes,</squote> we said immediately, even before viewing. We were
shown around by Pierre. The flat was on the third floor; two rooms;
soft Proven&ccedil;al view; good intimate furnishing and colour; running
hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up, basin and bidet;
own private, modern lavatory.
   <p>The first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence. We
were woken up twice about dawn by a soft eruption of turtle-doves.
This was strange, even magic, because the owner's name was Pierre
Tortorolo which, in Nicoison Italian means <squote>turtledove</squote>. Pierre
Turtledove. When we woke up properly it was raining, an even more
hopeless rain than London, and we looked out of the windows at the
weeping trees and the curling white breath of the mountains. The land
looked like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her shame.
There they were, in fact, below us, eight of them. Four of them were
flattened on the window sills, two immolated on a nearby roof top, the
other pair copulating.
   <p>We had a morning at Pierre's. He talked about people. Marc
Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named Lawrence. He was
here, near the railway station, three or four years. During this
period he wrote a book, The Lover of Lady Chatterly. No, he hadn't
read it; Madame did all the reading. Lawrence died in this very
place. He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and again. No, he
couldn't really remember him, he was one of the crowd.
   <p>The sun came out; Mart went shopping; I sat in the square reading
the \Patriote. There was a front-page rear-attack on \de Gaulle,
and the rest of the paper was given up to murders, apart for 
an outcry against a proposal to drop radio-active material into the
Mediterranean between Corsica and St Raphael. All the murders were
well documented and had the air of being written by an ingenious, but
mad film director of the Thirties. They mostly occurred in lonely
farm-houses.
   <p>Monsieur H, for instance, had been clubbed and throttled to
death by his wife, children and father-in-law, after muddling up some
sheep while the worse for drink. The family group then sat down for a
late lunch before the father-in-law telephoned the police. Then
again, Monsieur V, owing to family troubles, had written to the
local paper and the superintendent of police, informing them that he
was on the point of committing suicide, and gratefully leaving his
house appurtenances and utensils to the superintendent. Monsieur
V's house was immediately surrounded by firemen and other officials,
but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned a few minutes later from
a nearby village, apologising for the trouble, but explaining that the
walls were porous and the gas had escaped.
   <p>General relief was expressed, but Monsieur V (this was actually
reported in the next issue) returned home and shot himself, leaving a
note which again left his household goods to the superintendent. Some
grim comic relief was provided by an elderly farm labourer out for a
shoot who hid himself in a bush and imitated a blackbird.
Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver was after this very bird and
shot the farm-labourer in the face. All, however, ended well,
reported the paper, since the pellets were easily removed and the
labourer was able to return to work the same afternoon.
   <p>We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta. You can free-wheel
down a quarter of the way. In the middle of the journey is a valley
with a sea of vines and olives and beaches of earth pricked to blood
by the hoe. Rising from the flecked sea are islands tapering to
shipwrecked castles and towns, grey, rose-headed mariners clinging
like limpets to the rock. There is a curd of morning smoke and a
muffled bell taps the sky. Here we stopped, as in fine weather we
always stopped.
   <p>Down below is the village of Cagnes, but between are pockets of
heat and cold like the hands of friends or strangers, and a flurry of
early smells, the dark bosoms of beech and the thin pine fingers
kissed by the sun.
   <p>Then here was Nice, and the old holiday sea, blue as a new school
exercise book. The same old Nice, creamy, vulgar, out of time,
bitter-sweet with the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
prostitutes, edging past grubby grandeur to the old sleeping port.
This, and Paris, were my ruined pavilions, and I could catch the
taste of dead dreams on my tongue like spray.
   <p>We parked the Lambretta opposite the Negresco, and went to the
beach to have a swim. Amazing bedlam rocked in our eyes. The sea
boiled with waves, they galloped to the walls and spumed over the
Promenade \des Anglais. A huge crowd had collected. There were
firemen and policemen and ambulances, and the eyes of the spectators
were hard with disaster. They all had that neat look of Mediterranean
people to whom nothing could ever happen, the chosen sane, the
uncuckolded, unrobbed, sheltered from disease and accident by doctors,
God and the municipality. Yet, at any time now, the bell would ring
for them &mdash; the gilded love house, the mad grandmother or the bloody
child at the crossroads. Mart, too, was sucked into the crowd, not
because she felt immune from horror, but because for her the world was
always ending, except in bed. I joined her. Far out at sea we could
see a circular rubber object with a body on it. The body was the
colour of rotten marble.
   <p><squote>It's a woman,</squote> said Mart. A boat was approaching it, and
someone in oilskins leant over the boat and fell in. It was
accidental, but nobody in the crowd made a sound. It was as if the
visible world were an infamous church. Then two men grappled on to
the marble body and slowly dragged it up on to the boat.
   <p>It was growing cold. We left the crowd and drove back to Vence.
The cool evening perfumes stood beckoning at the corners of the
roads. Mart is unable to smell (her sense organs were impaired years
ago), and I had to explain the low, sharp and sweet signals in the
air. When we got back home we felt exhausted. London sickness (a
sense of guilt, mingled with the memory of sandwiches and incestuous
Soho pubs) still numbed our brains and bodies. We went straight to
bed and slept until the turtle-doves drummed up the sun.
   <p>The next morning, in the square opposite Pierre's, I read about
the Nice beach catastrophe in the \Patriote. Mart had been right,
the body had been a woman's. It belonged to a Madame N. Enquiries
had been made in the neighbourhood, and it transpired that Madame
N's husband had made an arrangement with the dead lady's sister to
launch her into the strong sea and there be left to perish. The
sister, able to swim, had returned to the shore, but instead of
returning to her brother-in-law (with whom she had an illicit

<head>Homage for Isaac Babel</head>
<head>DORIS LESSING</head>
   <p>The day I promised to take Catherine down to visit my young
friend Philip at his school in the country, we were to leave at
eleven, but she arrived at nine. Her blue dress was new, and so were
her fashionable shoes. Her hair had just been done. She looked more
than ever like a pink and gold Renoir girl who expects everything from
life.
   <p>Catherine lives in a white house overlooking the sweeping brown
tides of the river. She helped me clean up my flat with a devotion
which said that she felt small flats were altogether more romantic
than large houses. We drank tea, and talked mainly about Philip, who,
being 15, has pure stern tastes in everything from food to music.
Catherine looked at the books lying around his room, and asked if she
might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel to read on the train.
Catherine is 13. I suggested she might find them difficult, but she
said, <squote>Philip reads them, doesn't he?</squote>
   <p>During the journey I read newspapers and watched her pretty
frowning face as she turned the pages of Babel, for she was determined
to let nothing get between her and her ambition to be worthy of
Philip.
   <p>At the school, which is charming, civilised and expensive, the
two children walked together across green fields, and I followed,
seeing how the sun gilded their bright friendly heads turned towards
each other as they talked. In Catherine's left hand she carried the
stories of Isaac Babel.
   <p>After lunch we went to the pictures. Philip allowed it to be
seen that he thought going to the pictures just for the fun of it was
not worthy of intelligent people, but he made the concession, for our
sakes. For his sake we chose the more serious of the two films that
were showing in the little town. It was about a good priest who
helped criminals in New York. His goodness, however, was not enough
to prevent one of them from being sent to the gas chamber; and Philip
and I waited with Catherine in the dark until she had stopped crying
and could face the light of a golden evening.
   <p>At the entrance of the cinema the doorman was lying in wait for
anyone who had red eyes. Grasping Catherine by her suffering arm, he
said bitterly: <squote>Yes, why are you crying, he had to be punished for
his crime, didn't he?</squote> Catherine stared at him, incredulous.
Philip rescued her by saying with disdain: <squote>Some people don't know
right from wrong even when its  demonstrated to them.</squote>
The doorman turned his attention to the next red-eyed emerger from
the dark; and we went on together to the station, the children silent
because of the cruelty of the world.
   <p>Finally Catherine said, her eyes wet again: <squote>I think its
 all absolutely beastly, and I can't bear to think about
it.</squote> And Philip said: <squote>But we've got to think about it, don't you
see, because if we don't it'll just go on and on, don't you
see?</squote>
   <p>In the train going back to London I sat beside Catherine. She
had the stories open in front of her, but she said: <squote>Philip's
awfully lucky. I wish I went to that school. Did you notice that
girl who said hullo to him in the garden?

<head>Stopping and Mowing</head>
<head>(Instructions that should have come with my motor mower)</head>
   <p>WE WELCOME you to the ranks of satisfied owners of Motor
Mowers. Well, <squote>ranks</squote> is hardly the word, you think you're an
officer now you've got one of these, don't you, ha ha! Just because
your lawn is a bit bigger than the average suburban size, you see
yourself gently ambling behind this thing, painting a swathe of
perfect greensward as you go...
   <p>Who do you think you are? This is the cheapest model we make,
all gaudily painted to attract people like you. You must know that
proper lawns, belonging to stately homes or golf clubs, are made with
proper, dark green mowers, that the man sits on in a shiny steel
saddle; old mowers, that we made fifty years ago, efficient, heavy,
inherited by their owners, long before these modern notions of
egalitarianism and an expanding economy compelled us to turn out these
fiddling little things for people like you, to keep our factory going
in off periods, when we are not servicing these proper, old mowers for
our titled clients. However, since you've bought it, and much good
may it do you, here are a few hints.
<head>STARTING (a) From cold:</head>
   <p>1. Take the plug out. Watch that little tin thing sticking up;
it catches your knuckles when the spanner suddenly gives. We've given
you a set of spanners, made of lead.
   <p>2. Clean the plug, if possible. It will be smothered in oil,
because you have to put the oil in the petrol; there is no separate
lubrication system. You probably think the oil is ignited with the
petrol vapour in the cylinder, so how can you lubricate an engine with
smoke? Well, as you can see, it isn't ignited. It just wets the
plug.
   <p>3. Undo the nut at the bottom of the cylinder, and a lot more oil
will dribble out &mdash; well, you shouldn't have it on the grass yet.
Put the nut back &mdash; steady, not too tight, the bottom of the cylinder
is made of lead, too. Well, now you've broken the thread, just make
it as tight as you can.
   <p>3a. You've left the washer off that nut. That's why you broke
the thread. No garage will have a washer that size, you'd better
start looking for it in the grass.
   <p>4. Put plug back, and watch out for your other knuckles. Aah,
sorry! The same knuckles. Not too tight, you won't get away with
doing this just once, you'll only make it hard to undo again.
   <p>5. Kick starter (or pull rope, if it's one of those). Again.
Full choke. Again, again, again. Full throttle. Again twenty-seven
times, with every possible combination of throttle and choke. Again,
with half thrott &mdash;
   <p>6. Switch the petrol on, you fool.
   <p>7. Repeat (5). Then repeat (1-4), plug will be wetter than when
you started by now.
   <p>8. Repeat (5) again. Go and lie down for a bit.
   <p>9. Run like hell with it in gear.
<head>STARTING (b) From hot:</head>
   <p>It is impossible to start this engine from hot. It is something
to do with that oil vapour. Once you let it stop, you've had it,
you'll have to wait for it to get stone-cold and start from the
beginning. Just don't leave it for a second, and keep it roaring.
<head>ADJUSTMENT OF BLADES:</head>
   <p>There is a hairbreadth adjustment on this machine, between the
position where it just brushes the top of the grass and the one where
it digs great gashes in the earth. Practice with a new electric light
switch. If you can find a position where the light just flickers
between <squote>on</squote> and <squote>off</squote> you'll be able to wangle these blades.
Remember that they are finely, not to say neurotically adjusted.
Quite a small pebble will wrench the blades out of shape. You will
know when this has happened when they either make a frightful clanging
noise or won't go round at all. The people for whom we make our
proper mowers do not have pebbles on their lawns, let alone the small
metal fire engines, dolls' boots, plastic alphabets, nails and spoons
that litter yours.
<head>OPERATION:</head>
   <p>It is only possible to operate this machine at a steady trot.
At ordinary walking pace it will stall. And remember, the clutch is
not a gradual affair like the one on a car. The instant you engage it
the machine will rush away, with or without you. So it's no good
trying to cut round those silly little circular rosebeds you have.
This machine only mows in a dead straight line, any curves and you'll
dig into the earth. What do you expect for the price you paid, a
differential axle?
<head>MAINTENANCE:</head>
   <p>You will find a number of little contraptions with spring caps,
for putting the oil in. They won't leave room for the spout of any
oilcan, however thin; you'll just have to squirt away, making an oozy
mess, and hope some of it's getting in. Soon the spring caps will
come off, anyway; then there'll just be these little holes blocked
with oily grass.
   <p>Finally, three golden rules:
   <p>1. Keep a magnet for finding washers, spring caps, nuts, etc.
   <p>2. NEVER LET IT STOP.
   <p>3. Don't give your hand-mower away.
<head>Official Deceiver</head>
   <p>AS ANY typist knows, the typewriter reveals the subconscious
of the machine age mainly by three simple devices (or decives); the
confusion of c with v, of k with l, and the interchange of vowels
(e.g. paino for piano) or vonsonants. Much more
linguistic research has been devoted to these three <squote>major</squote>
substitutions than to the two <squote>minor</squote> ones &mdash; the appearance of the
figure 8 in place of the apostrophe and of m for the comma. This last
always seems to me like a self-deprecatory clearing of the throat, a
rudimentary ahem, as if to suggest that all man8s thought is
improvisedm and should not be taken too seriously.
   <p>Of all the words thrown up by my typewriter I have yet to see one
more real and significant than bunkrapt. Everybody knows what
ordinary bankruptcy is, and the gloomier vommentators often speak of
<squote>the bankruptcy of our civilisation</squote>. Now vivilization can never
really be bankrupt; the very word suggests that vivilized man is
vivified, alive &mdash; and as long as he8s alice there8s hope. It is
mere defeatism to say that our vicilization is bankrupt; but once,
by means of the typewriterm we have isolated this voncept of
bunkraptcy, we are like Bright and Hodgkinm isolating and naming
those diseases which bear their names. We are half-way, if not to
curing, at least to vuring it.
   <p>For what is bunkraptcy but the state of being rapt by bunk,
entranced by rubbish, absorbed by frovilous unreality? A bunkrapt
is, surely, a man who sits for hours staring at TC, or reading
newspapers filled with gissop volumns retailing the acticities
(too often extramartial) of worthless nenontities such as acrots
and catresses, film srats and coroners. There is an invurable
fricolity about a bunkrapt, a refusal to face up to reality; the
full stature of man is diminished in him. After all it's no good
pretending the world isn8t real. It's only too lear.
   <p>But in our vicilization any man who faves up to the real
world is pat to be dubbed <squote>square</squote>. There is real danger to the
civilization of the Wets here. It is no good simply sneering at the
Russians for being <squote>puranitical</squote> when actually they are simply
more teun with the lear facts of life than we are. Unless we
pukk up our socks the Russiansm the <squote>squares</squote>, will have the
kast kaugh; and very unpleasant it wikk sound.
   <p>What is to be done, then? I would suggest, now we have found the
word for what is wrong with us, that there is a way out without being
purinatical or <squote>quares</squote>. Why do we not treat bunkraptcy
precisely as we treat bankruptcy? Let us have a Bunkraptcy Vourt,
before which persons who had gone bunkrapt would have to appear.
But the proceedings would be medical as well as legal. Bunkraptcy
is a disease as well as a crime, and would have to be treated partly
as crime was terated in Samuel Butler's Nowhere &mdash; i.e.
medivally.
   <p>It should not be difficult to work out a set of standard tests
for determining a man's Reality Quotient (RQ), analogous to the
IQ tests. After all, many psychoolgists spend their whole
lives working out tests named after themselves. The tests should take
into account a man8s whole being, not just his tastes in
entertainment. A baker, let us saym would score so many points for
doing a real job that for him to read or view bunk would not be nearly
so serious as for a stockbroker, engaged in a job that is
fundamentally unlear, nothing to do with making or fashioning
anything except money. A stockbroker would lose heavily for reading
fricolous newspapers. Anyone with children reasonably well brought
up would have a head start. But a serious person who read no bunk at
all wouldn8t come off too well; the thing is not to be rapt by
it.
   <p>The legal side of the Bunkraptcy Vourt would consist in the
fact that a person with a RQ below the statuotry mimunim
would be registered as an induscharged bunkrapt, not allowed to
take any part in public life until, after attendance at a
Herabilitation Centre, he had upgraded his RQ.
   <p>
   <p>Some may think that this would be starting from the wrong end,
that personal Bunkraptcy is an inevitable, unblameable response to
living in an over-complex, fractured society in which even the
creative ratists who set the tone of our cicikization are no
longer all-round totally real men like Shakespeare; they are men who
exclusively, intensely mebody one snigle facet of life, such as
dismebodied intellect (Shaw), misonygy (Stringberd), historical
pattern (Tonybee), sexaul feredom (Lawrence. Only a bunkrapt
vicilization could have made such an extraordinary cause
v&egrave;lebre of Lady Chattelrey's Lover). This may be so. But if
writers hace changed the worldm may not typewriters change it
also? M?
<head>The Obliviscents</head>
   <p>HOW CURIOUS England will be in fifty years' time, when every
fair-sized town has a university, doubtless interconnected by
motorways, and everyone under twenty-five is a student, belonging
to that Union (ideally the motorways would have a special lane for
dons &mdash; a tutorway &mdash; so as to make these increasingly scarce men
rapidly available to several universities). People like me, who spend
their whole lives trying not merely to keep the facts within a subject
separate (answer quickly now, what are a full cadence, a half-cadence,
a plagal cadence, a false cadence?) but to prevent the subjects
themselves from merging into a comfortable academic dreamland, nothing
to do with actual life, will be even worse off than we are now. How
shall we possibly hold up our heads among all these students, on whom
these universities will have acted like hypo, fixing for ever the
clear photographic images, bright, separate, distinct, that we all had
at the height of our powers, when we were sixteen? (Hypo what?
Hypochloride. Hyposulphate? Hypocrite? You see what I mean.)
   <p>There ought to be a word for us: obliviscents, people who forget.
Of course, everyone forgets; but obliviscents are people who try not
to, who worry about it. The other day the word Mardonius popped
into my head from nowhere. I couldn't for the life of me remember
whether he was Greek or Persian, although I could remember writing
an essay about him at school. But surely it isn't all or nothing,
must we admit that all that effort is as if it had never been? Was it
not something, at least, to know he was B.C., and not, for
instance, a Roman? So I clung to this shadowy Mardonius,
simultaneously a hard, noble Greek soldier and a soft, curling-lipped
Persian tyrant; bearded and clean-shaven; on both sides at once, a
faint ghost-Mardonius in the sky; a potentiality, only half-real.

<head>CHINESE GEESE</head>
   <p>EARLY in our occupation of Pond Cottage, when it was yet
scarcely homely, I heard another and uglier noise. It was the voices
of two geese, and they were to plague us for many a month. Looking
out of my bedroom window in the early light I observed these lovely
birds floating lightly on the water's surface and giving off at
intervals a colourable imitation of a klaxon-horn. Inquiry revealed
that they were the property of one of my neighbours, whose custom it
was to give them the freedom of the water at frequent intervals. They
were of the kind called Chinese geese but they were far from
inscrutable. They were vile in temper, dreadful bullies and cowards,
noisy in and out of season, and, as I have said, really beautiful. It
seemed surprising to me that so much that was objectionable should
reside in such a lovely source.
   <p>An inquiry of their owner, a calm man who seemed unmoved by their
clamour, as parents enjoy the crying of their children, revealed the
excellent news that, though he had hoped for better things, they were
both females and unlikely on that account to produce young of their
kind. I realized that I had had a fortunate escape when he also added
that they were the only two survivors of a brood of eight. <squote>Terribly
delicate, they are, as chicks</squote>, he said, and it was, I dare say, too
much to hope that this delicacy would persist into adult life. It was
perhaps evidence of their unabatable vitality that during the two
years I knew them they produced, and brooded upon, infertile eggs of
very large size in considerable numbers, one of which the owner
presented to me <squote>for my breakfast</squote>.
   <p>Now either I had to live with them, a nearly impossible
proposition, since every time I put my head over the hedge they
produced a series of loud metallic cries, or I had to get rid of them.
Actually the latter was my only course since they had already decided
either to attack or hoot at all comers. Their technique was to rush
at you, and they were not small birds, heads lowered and outstretched,
and uttering their offensive cries so loudly that they could be (and
in fact they were) heard a mile off. If you stood your ground they
came to a stop and sidled off in another direction.
   <p>How could I dispose of them? I had to do it without offence to
their owner &mdash; who, as I say, was a peaceable, decent chap &mdash; but I had
also another hurdle to jump. Just along the road lived a local animal
lover, who had already eyed me suspiciously when I had moved on the
several cats who, in various degrees of decrepitude, were mothered by
her. I began my campaign by the usual shooing process. This merely
amused the geese. They appeared to look elsewhere, indeed, until I
realized afresh, as you have to, that all birds look at you from the
sides of their heads. They might sail a couple of yards away, drawing
themselves up to the highest points of their dignity, but they would
immediately and in unison, as if from a radio signal, veer around and
make back to the place from which their manoeuvre had begun. Arm
waving produced no results except to incite them to guttural grunts of
derision.
   <p>I must admit that I thought of many desperate measures: of going
out at night with an airgun; of throwing poisoned bread upon the
waters (which would have been useless since, unlike moorhens, they did
not take to bread, and appeared to subsist on a diet of grass). My
alarm was increased by my reference to a book on pet keeping which
confirmed my worst fears about Chinese geese. It actually warned pet
keepers against the wisdom of attempting to keep both Chinese geese
and friendly neighbours. I presented the book to their owner but if
he read that passage it did not affect his behaviour.
   <p>In fairness to myself I must add that I had no wish to hurt the
geese. It had to be psychological warfare, mental cruelty. In the
end I decided that a process of steady discouragement was the only
policy. Whenever they appeared on the pond, and I was present, I
threw a sprinkle of small grit around them. At first they exhibited
no emotion apart from comical surprise. I persisted in this
sprinkling campaign for nearly a whole winter, not without success.
As spring approached they appeared less and less, and indeed on
seeing me they would, without undue haste, turn around and retreat to
whence they came.
   <p>For a time an intermittent peace reigned on the pond. If other
terrors arising from the pond population came and went (as, for
instance, the day my wife saw a large rat walk slowly across our
bridge towards the front door, or the sudden surprise of beady
shrew-eyes from the pond's grass banks), at least we had seemingly rid
ourselves, without offending anyone openly, of our Chinese geese.
Between whiles a charming bevy of about a dozen white (and more or
less silent) geese occasionally trooped down the village street,
fluttered and splashed in the pond for a while and then, in solemn
dignified file, returned to their drier quarters. They should have
been grateful to me, for when the Chinese geese were about they had no
difficulty in hounding off these peaceful creatures.
   <p>If this chapter reads like a successful rout, I am sorry to have
given you the wrong impression. Those Chinese geese finally fooled me
and everyone else. In May, in our second Pond Cottage summer, these
two geese returned, and with them, unaccountably, there shuffled to
the water's edge a clutch of six chicks, faintly yet assuredly
resembling their parents. That was one of the turning points of my
life as a pond-dweller.
<head>17</head>
<head>PARISH PUMP</head>
   <p>RUMOUR had had it for some years past that water &mdash; a parish
supply as it is called &mdash; was on its way to Wilborough. The supply of
water to remote villages and hamlets is one of the beneficent
functions performed in this rather deplorable century. In villages it
marks the end of water as a precious liquid, to be dispensed frugally,
weighed out drop by drop.
   <p>Living at Pond Cottage I had been able to appreciate my own ample
supplies while viewing the bucket-dipping villagers from my window.
There were periods when I was amazed at the rareness of their visits
to the spring &mdash; yet it could not be denied that the villagers were
clean people, even shining clean. Those who had lived in the heart of
the countryside will know that, in the sense of grubbiness, as opposed
to good, clean dirt, it is not easy to get dirty. When we first lived
in the country my wife worried as to who would clean our windows. We
searched around for a window-cleaner, but she need not have worried.
When we left that cottage two years later the windows, though never
touched, were as clean as when we came in.
   <p>If the country air is good for complexions and windows it must
also be marvellously disinfectant. The amount of waste of one kind
and another that has to be destroyed or concealed in any village has
to be thought about to be believed. In villages &mdash; of the thatched
variety &mdash; it is not safe to light a bonfire to burn rubbish. In most
cases it is consigned to the kindly, effacing earth; in others
chickens and birds are the agents of disposal. Where the material is
indestructible, well, every village has its dumping ground, its
ancient pits &mdash; and now and again, as we know, there is luckily a pond
or stream.
   <p>One day the surveyors arrived. They paused long outside Pond
Cottage to decide the line of pipes, and they eyed the pond itself
with glances made up equally of anxiety and animosity. This was their
lowest point, and after the spanning of our little valley they could
once more rise. The village was full of depressing rumours. They
would drain the pond; they would run pipes across the arches of the
little bridge; and so on. Fortunately the plans of the water
engineers lay elsewhere. With a mechanical digging monster, eating up
earth and rocks with equal ease, they dug a deep trench on the side of
the road furthest from the pond's edge.
   <p>To the barely suppressed satisfaction of most of us the
excavation immediately filled with water, and thereafter the scene
became a morass: ditch, ruts, mud, grey-brown hillocks of earth, large
stones, untidy clods of grass, with a few pieces of newspaper and some
old cement bags thrown in for good measure. It remained thus for a
whole summer.
   <p>An attempted laying of pipes began. A small pump arrived and
cleared the trench of water long enough for the pipes to be set in
position. Then the water once more resumed its engulfing sway. So
that the ditch could be cleared sufficiently of water for sealing the
joints, a more delicate job, the little petrol pump was again conjured
to work valiantly &mdash; but it proved unequal to its task. The trench
remained obstinately full; the water seeped in as fast as it was
pumped away. For some weeks the matter remained thus, while the
supervisors, who occasionally arrived in shining saloon cars,
scratched their heads over the problem.
   <p>The impasse was finally broken one rainy Saturday. A man-sized
pump arrived borne upon the platform of a lorry. It was this pump
which was to prove the major enemy, and not the water. Anyone who has
ever had to deal with a Diesel or petrol engine will know the
possibilities of trouble here. They are bad enough on a hot afternoon
with a lawn-mower. These men went through all the known processes to
the point of exhaustion. The engine started, stopped, started,
stopped again, always for no apparent reason. The four men concerned
explored all possibilities and experienced every feeling from hope to
despair. They cajoled, wheedled, entreated, tinkered. Eventually
they knocked off for a smoke and a cup of tea.
   <p>This campaign proceeded for an entire morning. I was amazed at
the workmen's stolid patience. Then as we were all giving up in
despair, for I shared their experience from my window, the pump
started and continued genially as if it too had had enough and wanted
to perform its task and get home for the day. Once going, the job was
tidied up, the trench filled, in less than an hour; and the landscape
settled into the condition of quiet waiting which had been its role
through the ages. Soon the grass would grow again over the trench and
over the piped water of the twentieth century.
   <p>About a month later a number of workmen came through the village
and, with the active co-operation of the villagers, made little
right-angled connections with the main pipe to each front door taking
the water. This was a job soon dispatched although fraught with small
obstacles in the way of trickles of springs beneath the road surface.
It remained then for the villagers to take the water indoors. On a
fine spring morning came the news by post from the rural district
council that water would be put into pipes on a particular date, and
that supplies could then be delivered. On that day a villager in a
cottage turned a tap &mdash; and the utility of Wilborough Pond was, after a
thousand years, ended. Thereafter it became a piece of the landscape.
   <p>I had a sign written, taking the first Saxon mention of the
village. I hung it on our gate: THIS POND, FOR A THOUSAND YEARS,
PROVIDED WATER TO THE VILLAGERS OF THIS HAMLET A.D. 888-1957.
<head>18</head>
<head>CHAIN OF LIFE</head>
   <p>STEADY effort for nearly two years, punctuated by bursts of
great energy, had been put to the end of making the pond and its
cottage a piece of landscape such as you read about or see in a film:
a veritable picture.

<text id=LOBR09>
   <p>All new equipment takes a bit of getting used to. It was some
time before one's spoon became a weapon of relative precision and the
pudding finished up in one's mouth instead of in one's right ear or on
the wall behind one. Gloves, hairbrushes, lavatories &mdash; pretty well
all the accessories of everyday life &mdash; were unmanageable to begin
with; but in that distant era one received patient and elaborate
coaching in their use.
   <p>Middle age has no mentors; nobody says, <quote>No, not like that,
dear. Like this.</quote> I defy anyone who puts on a pair of
spectacles for the first time not to feel that he has done it in a
slightly ridiculous way. And so, in all probability, he has, as,
grasping the fragile contraption in both hands, he fastens it
uncertainly on his face like a man putting on a false beard at some
ghastly rout. Not since &mdash; in something of the same surreptitious,
apprehensive manner &mdash; he smoked his first cigarette has he been so
unexpectedly reminded that there is a right way and a wrong way of
doing things.
   <p>
   <p>Once having lodged upon his nose what he used scornfully to call
gig-lamps, he makes a long, searching scrutiny of his reflection in
the mirror. There can be no doubt that he looks extremely odd. Life
has played a practical joke on him, but it is an obscure rather than
an unkind practical joke. Although he still regards spectacles as
per se faintly ridiculous (why else do we say bespectacled &mdash;
cf. begrimed, bedizened and besotted &mdash; and not betrousered or even
bebearded?), he persuades himself that he looks no sillier than
he looked before. Rather, indeed, the reverse. A certain \gravitas
has been added. He finds himself for the first time wondering
whether he might not have had a considerable future as a dentist, or
in the Treasury.
   <p>But he has still to present this new persona to the world,
and face the world's reactions. Way back, when similar ordeals were
undergone, no pains were spared to allay his misgivings and boost his
morale. <quote>But, darling, you look so nice in it! Doesn't he, Nanny?
It's awfully becoming. All the other little boys at the party
will be wearing &mdash; well, the same sort of thing only I expect not so
nice. I promise you they will.</quote> None of this nonsense now.
   <p>He knows what he will get from his children. The spectacles
confer, in his view, a patriarchal air; they delicately underline the
eventual need for petits soins; he can almost feel the rug
round his knees, smell the aroma of the cocoa simmering on the hob.
(The blacksmith should be able to knock up a hob.) But he knows what
he will get from his children, and he gets it.
   <p><quote>Daddy!</quote> they scream, convulsed with laughter. <quote>What are
you up to? Why are you wearing spectacles? You do look
funny!</quote>
   <p>A rat caught in a gin-trap by one leg will often gnaw the leg
off. To disembarrass your face of spectacles involves a simpler, far
less drastic process; but if you have never done it before it is
difficult to do it as though to the manner born. You cannot lay your
ears back; you do not show the whites of your obsolescent eyes. But
your face, emerging from between the shafts, inevitably reflects the
part-rebellious, part-apprehensive, part-apologetic expression of an
old saddle-horse which has not previously worn harness. Once you have
expunged from their minds the idea that you are dressing up in order
to amuse them, your new gimmick can be explained to your children; but
it cannot be airily explained, any more than it can to your
over-facetious or over-solicitous contemporaries.
   <p>I had hardly obtained a pair of spectacles when I ceased to need
them, my eyes suddenly getting a second wind. This reprieve (which
for all I know is a common occurrence) began soon after one of my
aunts recommended yeast to me as a cure for failing memory. My memory
is appalling. I shovelled down the unexpired portion of my aunt's
yeast-ration &mdash; this was at the breakfast-table &mdash; and continued for a
time to eat the stuff. Post, I suspect, rather than
propter hoc I threw away my reading glasses; my memory
continued to deteriorate.
   <p>Two or three years later a minor military campaign in Arabia
strengthened the delusion that for me spectacles were a thing of the
past. So refulgent was the sun, and so few the place-names on our
unreliable maps, that I snapped my fingers at Salisbury Plain and the
deep misgivings aroused upon it.
   <p>But now &mdash; grateful for a reprieve none the worse for a dummy
run &mdash; I am once more, when I read, bespectacled.
<head>THE MAN WE KILLED</head>
   <p>One of us is a Cabinet Minister. One of us died of drink last
month. One of us is an earl. One committed suicide many years ago.
One, I think, is an expert on Russia. One is an admiral. Some I
have forgotten altogether. Several others must be dead.
   <p>The man we killed was called Mr Jackson. He was a master at
our private school towards the end of the First War. I do not
remember him as clearly as I should; one reason for this is that he
did not last long.
   <p>I suppose he was about twenty-five. He had reddish hair which
stood up over his forehead in a quiff. He wore spectacles with metal
rims and a blazer with a crest on the breast pocket. He was very
short-sighted and we believed him to make matters worse by not
cleaning his spectacles. He had a plaintive, rather common voice and
a lolloping gait. He took the Sixth Form in (I think) Greek; I am
ashamed that I cannot remember his subject with certainty.
   <p>Mr Jackson was, I suppose, fairly typical of the sort of
material with which headmasters have to make up their staffs in the
closing stages of a major war. All I can recall about his previous
career is that it had taken him to Singapore, where, he told us, the
natives played football with bare feet. He had served as a special
constable during disturbances in the city, and was easily encouraged
to relate his memories of those stirring times. They were not
sensational; once Mr Jackson had been on duty all night and it had
rained without stopping.
   <p>It would be interesting to know how many hours or days or weeks
in the school year are lost to learning by boys inducing masters to
embark on martial or other reminiscences. In my time at Eton there
was a French master &mdash; and he really looked like a French master &mdash;
called M. Larsonnier, who had served with the French contingent
which helped to sack Peking after the Boxer Rebellion. If you could
only get him started, he had a splendid set-piece. <quote>Who was ze
first into ze Forbidden City? It was I! Who was ze first into
ze Winter Palace? It was I! Who was ze first into ze Empress
Dowager's bedroom? It was I!</quote> <quote>And who</quote> (we would wittily chime
in) <quote>was ze first into ze Empress Dowager's bed?</quote> I
imagine that less time is wasted in this way at girls' schools.
   <p>Mr Jackson never had a chance. It was not merely that he had
no authority and was easily gulled; school-masters of this more or
less helpless kind generally arouse in their tormentors a sort of
mercy or tolerance, based perhaps on the feeling that if they are
handled too barbarously they will be replaced by some sterner fellow
and there will be no more cakes and ale.
   <p>But for some reason we actively disliked Mr Jackson, who had a
cocksure manner and a grating personality, and we gave him the full
treatment. Our school was near the coast, and soon after he arrived,
Mr. Jackson, jaded no doubt by the enervating climate of the
tropics, was heard to speak in appreciative terms of the sea-breezes
which stole into his bedroom. We took the first opportunity of
wedging a bloater under the springs of his mattress.
   <p><quote>Good morning, sir. Lovely fresh breeze this morning, isn't
there? You'd never think we were a mile from the sea, would you,
sir?</quote>
   <p>Mr. Jackson would concur in a baffled way.
   <p>At length masters with adjacent bedrooms were impelled to
investigate, and the putrescent bloater was removed.
   <p><quote>Good morning, sir. Did you see that perfectly beastly case in
the paper, sir? No, sir, not that one; after all, there's nothing
specially unpatriotic about murder. We meant the case where the
man was fined for hoarding food. I do think that sort of thing is
absolutely rotten when there's a war on, don't you, sir?
Apparently he used to hide it in his bedroom&hellip; . </quote>
   <p>And so on. Our worst excesses are lost in oblivion, but my
recollection is that we kept up a relentless pressure and that Mr.
Jackson ceased to be cocksure and became jumpy, irritable and
maladjusted.
   <p>
   <p>In the only incident I remember clearly, indeed vividly, I played
the leading part. Mr. Jackson was the sort of master who impels
boys, once they have established an ascendancy over him, to see how
much further they can go, and one day I decided to take a grass-snake
into his class.
   <p>We wore, in the summer, grey sweaters and grey flannel shorts. I
put the grass-snake, which was about three feet long but used to being
handled, in my pocket and kept my hand over it as a precaution. It
had had a feed a few days before and at first observed a perfect
decorum.
   <p>After a bit I became over-confident and relaxed my vigilance.
The snake got its head up my sleeve and began to climb up my arm.
Readers who have been in this particular situation will know that,
once a serpent has started climbing up your arm under your sleeve, it
matters little how much of the serpent is left in your pocket; you
cannot get it back into the pocket by using the arm it is climbing up,
and you cannot bring your other hand into play against it without
taking your sweater off, which &mdash; leaving snakes and schoolmasters out
of it &mdash; I defy anyone to do with one hand in his pocket.
   <p>Being at the top of the class, I sat directly underneath Mr.
Jackson's beaky nose. I was in a quandary. Seventyfive per cent. of
the snake had not yet passed the start-line and was still in my
pocket. I decided to try to stabilise this situation and gripped it
convulsively round what, if it had been me, would have corresponded to
its chest.
   <p>The snake cannot be blamed for failing to understand my motives.
It felt thwarted, and began to hiss. Human beings, when they hiss,
hiss outwards; a grass-snake makes a sound exactly like a human being
drawing his breath sharply inwards while stitches are being taken out
of a wound.
   <p><quote>Strix,</quote> asked Mr. Jackson, peering down at me, <quote>are you in
pain?</quote>
   <p><quote>No, sir,</quote> I said. I thought it prudent to let go of the
snake. It stopped hissing but went on climbing.
   <p>My urgent duty now was to prevent it doing what, if left to
itself, it would do, which was to make a bid for freedom by wriggling
out through the collar of my sweater. By this time, the snake's rear
echelon having left my pocket, I had both hands free and was easily
able, by clasping them to my throat in a rather precious manner, to
deny it egress. The snake turned south, towards my midriff.
   <p>It now had room to manoeuvre and was moving well; there was
nothing to do but to grab it before it escaped from my sweater. I
clasped one hand to my stomach and got it round the neck. It started
hissing again.
   <p><quote>What is the matter?</quote> asked Mr. Jackson irritably. <quote>Is
something hurting you?</quote> My bosom was heaving convulsively, on
account of the snake.
